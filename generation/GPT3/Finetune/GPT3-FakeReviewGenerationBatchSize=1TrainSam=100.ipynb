The GPT-3 model is able to generalize from the given prompt about the task at hand, and generates text pretty well in line of maintaining context. However, it could be said that finetuning guides the GPT3 model to output more in line to our task. For example, the regular model generated: `Chicken parmesan sandwich was on point. The lady asked if I wanted to take a picture of it. Of course I said yes. The lady said she could use the picture and that`. While this is on point for a fake review, the part where the model generates texts related to taking pictures is not relevant to us. Our finetuned model on the other hand did not have that problem.
