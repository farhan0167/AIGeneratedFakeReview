The service is always great and the food is always delicious. I've never had a bad meal here. The only thing I would change is that I would like to see a little more variety in the menu. I've tried a few different things on the menu and I've never been disappointed. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great ramen place in the area.I love this place. The food is great and the service is great. I've been here a couple of times and have never been disappointed. The food is always fresh and the prices are very reasonable. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is a little slow, but the food is always good and the prices are reasonable.
