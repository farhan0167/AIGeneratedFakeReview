Craig and his crew are quick! My car was finished when it was promised, maybe even a few days early. Craig was generous enough to give me a ride to my rental car when I dropped my car off.

I am a business owner on the east coast so I have no ulterior locally driven motive to give a good review.  I deal with a lot of people and businesses.

After finding this particular Meineke online via Yelp (yay), I trusted enough to send my wife with the car to get an oil change. I found ON MEINEKE.COM the full synthetic package for 69.95, including hinge such as tire rotation for no extra charge! I was like, WHAT?!?!?!?!? Most non-jifflubey shops charge 80-90 for the oil and filter and then try to upcharge for everything else.
