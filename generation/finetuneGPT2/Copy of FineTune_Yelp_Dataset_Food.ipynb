My first visit was a kinda a let down.  I had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in Indianapolis, but I only found 2 that I liked and only 1 was memorable.  However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in ...\n","52857  I've been in a few times now and I need to get my review in. Love this spot. Located right next door to my favorite homebrew shop, Great Fermentations, Bier is always a good time. They have growler fills every weekend with a huge line up each time. From the DFG to the Pumpkin ale, they always impress. Only issue I have is that when itry their beers outside of the brewery, I get something off. Maybe the beer line? I don't know but I sure do enjoy their pint nights! Those are every third Friday of the month. They always have some yummy food truck or restaurant come in to serve up the masses....\n","52858  If good beer is what you seek, look no further! Bier has got it going on and proudly has all their accolades displayed on the wall as they should.
