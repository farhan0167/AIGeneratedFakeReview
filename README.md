# AIGeneratedFakeReview


This repository is for the final project in our ML for Cyber Security class at NYU. To run these colab files, you may need access to our Drive files that we used throughout the project. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oiXzqqLV2Dmc2LQkwl1Wcu3pzG7U_FeJ?usp=sharing). 

The repository is broken down into generation and classification directories. The generation directory has all the notebooks we used for generation, including our GPT2 and GPT3 models. The classification directory contains notebooks used for the detection of fake reviews.
