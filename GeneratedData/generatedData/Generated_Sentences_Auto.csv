Automotive,3.0,OR,"Gas prices are going back down, but the four stations at the end of U.S 19 and 54th Avenue South are still gouging the public. Don't shop at this station unless you are on extreme 'E'. Stations just up the street on 25 cents lower."

Automotive,2.0,OR,Affordable basic wash but the brushes ripped the back wiper arm right off my car. Do not take a station wagon through this car wash. Friendly wash attendants but management does not return messages left on their machine and their contact form online does not let you submit an inquiry.
Automotive,1.0,OR,Scam scam scam. Avoid this place! The parking guy gave me a ticket as I was walking to my car. It was right at the time of expiration. After talking to him he said to just dispute this online and it would be fine! Nope I still got a ticket.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Went there to have and oil and filter change plus state inspection stickers. Price was fair and approved the work. However, couldn't make it back before closing. Manager Dave went out of his way to arrange an after hours pickup. Real important considering the current transist strike."
Automotive,2.0,OR,If I could give 0 stars I would they are horrible. I can see 7 shuttles from another company in 10 minutes and one from park and jet once an hour. I am always waiting 15-25 minutes for a pick up from the airport I will never use them again.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Staff has always been extra friendly and accommodating. Service is neither better or worse than any other providers of this type. Would rate them higher except I hate that they now make you pay outside. If you want anything inside, it now requires 2 transactions. Extra inconvenient for business costumers!"

Automotive,3.0,OR,Nice guys here. They even have a sign that invites you to look over their shoulder while they work which I always wanted to do while at other shops. Unlike Jiffy Lube they will also run the computerized scanner on your engine for free (tip appreciated of course.

Automotive,4.5,CG,"Their website doesn't lie, you are not paying for the premium wash. The vacuum area is a little small but it's a bit small but the car wash does a decent job. The customer service is excellent."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"The owner Patrick is liar and will lie to you. He will lie to you about what he is talking about. 

I will never take my car there again. I will tell everyone I know to not go here.I came here for an"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Don't try to trade in your vehicle, they will try to sell you more than you need and charge you an extra $100 for your trade in. 

This place is a joke. They are liars. Stay away from this place."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Just park at economy parking garage. The attendants are friendly and professional. There is a shuttle service. I recently had a bad experience with this company and the manager, John, was rude and condescending. I will never be back."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the shuttle is so long. The driver was nice and polite, but the driver was very rude.The customer service is great.  I've been coming here"
Automotive,2.0,CG,Awful experience with this dealership. We bought a car and decided to trade it in for a new one. We had an appointment and the car was delivered by the end of the day. The sales person was extremely friendly and helped us find a vehicle that

I have also found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I am a bit of a car person so it is sometimes hard to find a good mechanic in the area, but I have never"
Automotive,5.0,CG,Mark and Dave are the best. The guys are honest and will work with you to get you the best deal.  They are a family owned business that you can trust.  They are honest and take great care of their customers.I had an issue
Automotive,4.5,OR,"After going to several luxury dealerships, including  another Volvo dealership, I went to Ferman Volvo in Tarpon Springs and was given a fair price  and fair money on my trade, without all the going back and forth like the other dealerships. Will definitely recommend to my friends and clients."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This place is an upgrade from the creepy van you usually have to go to! It's in a little shack on the side of the gas station. The man was so friendly, and the process took maybe 5 minutes. If you check in on Yelp, you get $2 off! So convenient!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I rented a car from the Tampa Airport Enterprise on 11/18/2015.  Charlie helped me at the check-in counter, and Nabil took me to the car and went over everything with me.  Excellent service by the team.  It's this type of service that keeps me coming back to Enterprise!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Dropped off our car without an appointment (our bad) on a Friday AM for state inspection but did not get the car back until 4:30 PM on Sunday.  Youch.

Meanwhile they made all the minor repairs we needed and charged an OK price (Not great, not horrible).

Wish they were more timely."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I went somewhere else before I stopped by DentWorks, and these other guys turned me away saying ""it can't be done. You need bodywork."" Craig from DentWorks gave me a quote and took me in almost right away. I'm all about customer service and honest work. Glad I went with DentWorks!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Gerber did a great job on our cars. Don was so friendly, and the facility was nice and clean. We're highly satisfied with the work we had done (buffing the headlight lens covers),  so we'll be back in the future.  Great Job, Gerber! (My dad was thoroughly impressed, too)."
Automotive,1.5,OR,I called around looking for a part for our class A RV. RV Country was my third call. When my call was answered I was told the lady was on another call please hold. She came back said she done I'll transfer you now. Rang twice and was sent to voicemail.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I don't get it. The Toyota dealership in phx is great; this one is awful. There is always a long wait and they routinely say 30 minutes when they mean 3 hours.

They also somehow managed to add my email address to someone else's account so I get tons of garbage spam."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"One of the worst car searching experiences that I have encountered. This is a horrible car dealership. The staff lack customer service skills (dealers and sales manager alike). They are unorganized and do not care about their customers whatsoever. Hands-down, I would NEVER recommend, nor purchase a vehicle from Barbera Autoland."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I almost always go to Tires Plus when I have car issues. They are super friendly, open late and wait time are 8 times out of 10, reasonable. They can be more expensive or overpriced on some services but I would rather have a good job done right the first time."
Automotive,2.0,OR,Mr. Tire is a AAAAAA+++++ in our books!!!! Paul the manager is very honest and knowledgeable about cars and the services that they offer.  We always bring our cars to him for repairs or tires or oil changes.  We would highly recommend this place to our friends and family
Automotive,4.0,OR,"These guys are just awesome.   From the affable and knowledgeable front desk, to the technicians who go out of their way to show you parts being replaced- all this for RECALL work, offering them pennies.

I hope I can bring these fine folks some more work- although my wallet disagrees."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I had a good experience here getting my out of state plates, inspection, and registration updated. Very helpful, friendly, personable staff. They called several times to check in while the loan company lagged on sending the title. When they did receive it, it was an easy one-stop-shop to get everything legal."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Pretty normal Jiffy Lube. High pressure sales pitch trying to upsell you. Jose was an especially obnoxious and arrogant person to deal with. The best part though was overhearing one of the techs telling Jose he hated dealing with ""old people"". I guess only young people are welcome at this location."
Automotive,3.0,OR,Mike Murray was absolutely wonderful!  He explained everything they were doing and the difference between a regular oil and lube and a 30K checkup and the reasons for going the extra mile.  He was very knowledgeable and he really impressed me.  Thank you for the excellent service Mike!
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Bobby was so kind when I called him about working on my car. He found the problem and repaired it quickly. It cost less than I had expected and I couldn't be happier. If you are looking for an honest reasonable repair center I highly recommend Morris Automotive in Lavergne, TN."

Automotive,4.0,OR,"They left our car parked in a lot with the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked. This, in addition to their lack of automotive knowledge, doesn't allow me to feel comfortable leaving my car in their care. The main guy in the office is also rather ornery."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Very frustrating. Have tried to call this dealership for over one year to make appointment for my Range Rover airbag recall. Find myself on hold every-time. One time I did get a service person and was told i'd get a call back. That never happened. For the record, today was 5th attempt."

I will keep going back!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,I had the best experience getting my car fixed at Lithia. Chris was the estimator and he openly communicated with us every step of the way. It was practically a brand new car!! Thank you for giving my Explorer a new life and restoring it to be safe for our growing family.
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Worse car buying experience imaginable. There was a recall on my car after 1 week and another issue that they now ""don't have the replacement part for"". No straight answers. If you have a defective car known by a google search, probably shouldn't be selling the car, especially as a ""family business"""
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Certainly not fun to be stuck at, BUT, the staff were all friendly and shout out to Bonita who was Super Cool and handled my situation in a very courteous and professional manner. First time EVER an employee at an auto parts store gave me an accurate wait timeline, seriously, Bonita rules."

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I woke up on a Saturday morning to a flat tire. My first instinct was to call Tire Kingdom!  I always receive the best customer service there. They are so professional and most importantly, honest. They have truly earned my business and I refer them to all my friends and family."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I appreciated the low-pressure atmosphere. Tony Greer, my sales consultant was attentive and recommended test driving several cars.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Absolutely horrible experience, for the get go I'm never coming back here again.

I have unlimited car wash at Surf Thru and they are UNLIMITED!!!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Their products and online DIY videos are great, BUT, beware of their ways! For example their claim of giving $10 off your order when you Subcribe.

Automotive,3.5,OR,Santos is the place I've always taken my car. Not only do they get the job done but they're honest about it as well. When my car was saying I needed something outrages they solved it by saying it only needed oil. They know these cars and how they can be a hassle.
Automotive,2.0,OR,Waited over an hour after going through was  only to have 4 cars that came in after me get serviced before mine because they can't figure out where to place cars.  It's a time waster and joke.  Find somewhere else to go if you don't have 2 hours to waste.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Peter and Alex are trustworthy straight shooters. They tell me when I absolutely need something done. I have been bringing my car here for 2 years and after price shopping at other places, I can tell you that this place is priced competitively. The location is convenient and you don't need an appointment for an oil change."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Do not buy from this dealer.  After we bought our new Mazda and had a problem 
At 15000 miles they were very unhelpful with fixing the problem my car had.  It was like pulling teeth to get them to help me under full manufacture warranty.
Read the other reviews.  I am not the only one."

Automotive,3.5,OR,I looked all over for a well kept self service car wash and went here on my sister's recommendation. I received such friendly and helpful service from the proud poppa who owned the place as we chatted away with his son. The washing/waxing (and vacuuming) equipment was powerful and the place was clean. Will definitely return again.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Outstanding knowledge of European,  domestic and Japanese cars.  Thier capitalist but very fair so you know where they are coming from.   The owner somehow got me listening to Jason Maranz. I can't  ever  forgive him for this but will always buy cars from Dennis automotive and bring my cars for repairs."
Automotive,3.5,OR,Incredibly RUDE. Wildly EXPENSIVE (and I mean wildly- literally 4 times the price of what you would pay anywhere else). And you have to get out of your vehicle at this location??? The main point of going to a Jiffy Lube is so that you don't have to get out and can go about your way quickly.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Best ever! When you say to someone ""I have a guy"" this is primary example. Go nowhere else.  I remind everyone, that Burke builds actual rather e cars, so his equipment has to be state of the art vs all others in the Region.

Stay far away from this dealer."

This place has great quality honest people I thought I had a small issue with my car, but it turns out that it was something bigger. These guys referred me to some honest mechanics. I trust their service."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Their quote was pretty on point, they explained everything that needed to be done well, and I think I got a good value for it. They're good with minimizing the work (ex: making the paint match well enough instead of perfectly) when they learn if a customer is paying out of pocket vs using insurance, which I appreciated."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"After paying $69 for the Elite interior/exterior package with door/dash package, I wouldn't expect to run my finger through the door handle and get dirt and dust so easily.

Billy Vickery is a standup service advisor. He's a straight shooter who is honest and doesn't try to sell you on service you don't need. He has made my experience at this Lexus service department very pleasurable. I highly recommend contacting him for any service needs. You won't be disappointed."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Finally, a common sense car wash ! Staff couldn't be friendlier too. This place has vacuum statuon w/ air blower to get the dust outta the small spaces you can't get to, they also provide rags, window cleaner and a protective spray for the interior ! These guys are the new standard of ""cars wash"" in my opinion!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,It's a good car wash.  Tokens are $3.25 each but they go a long way.  I could wash my car and my bike with 2 tokens.  The degreaser works.  Staff helpful.   Hot soap too.  Only thing is that it is slow to switch between modes.  You enter through the BACK.
Automotive,2.5,OR,Amazing that they continue to waste your time. The manager asks you to call to resolve the issue and he passes it off to another person within the company and the stupid process starts all over again.   Drive 100 miles away before you purchase a car at this place.  Honesty is not in their vocabulary.

Sorry, but it is still a stellar one star."
Automotive,3.0,OR,They smashed up my car when I brought it in. It was severely damaged and only a lot of yelling and screaming did any good to get them to treat me fairly. My car may never be the same. I do not believe this was an isolated event. The facility is way too small with only one street entrance.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I was in need of some brake pads and to get things done for my next maintenance at the dealership. Instead I took my car here and saved $600, with a record turnaround time.

Automotive,3.5,OR,I have gotten two cars from Toyota and Ron Peoples is my go to person. There are certain things i want in a car and he knows what I like.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"So they buy Reno Dodge and the service which I thought couldn't be worse, gets worse.  Two recalls on vehicles bought at Reno Dodge and I've been trying to contact someone for two days.  No luck because Dolan just bought Reno Dodge and the phones don't work.   Big business gets bigger and the customer gets screwed."
Automotive,4.0,OR,So happy with the service and extra mile they went making my old 924s road worthy. The great advice and willingness to work with me on some significant issues when I was out of the area made it crystal clear that these are good people. If I could give them a sixth star I would have ! Thanks again !

Automotive,3.0,OR,"Busy transit center.

So many parking areas to leave your vehicle overnight. 

Don't bother going to the Dunkin inside the transit center

Cashiers are always friendly and will tell you when your train leaves.

If you are traveling to NY the rail line always hanged at the last minute, so just keep a close eye on it or you will miss your train."
Automotive,2.0,OR,The worst!!! The dealership is not about sale and service. Bunch of people that are just selling you stuff. Car truck warranty!!!! They had given me wrong title information and held it for months! I would usually give a dealership benefit of the doubt! Everyone that I had contact with besides the parts department are in the world of beef---JERKs!!!
Automotive,2.0,OR,"There was a girl named Shelly with tons of facial piercings that almost took off the rear view mirror as she was wiping down the car. When addressing our concern with mgt, all they said was oh she's new. Wow, what great customer service! This place is ghetto along with most of the employees. They need to higher their standards."
Automotive,4.5,OR,Literally saved me hundreds of dollars from Mercedes dealer and fixed same day without waiting week for dealer appt. over the years they have worked on numerous cars and trucks for my family without any issues and great pricing. There is nobody out there with the honesty and commitment I have seen with Keith and the rest of the crew.
Automotive,1.5,OR,"They some how tried to change the base cost of the price from it's listed price. Bought the car anyways... was told there was a spare key avaliable with their mechanic, mind you. Next thing you know, story changes no such thing as spare key. Too much hassle... playing phone tag. find a place that atleast will return your calls."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"These folks do a decent job of cleaning a vehicle, but they charge EXTRA for pet hair. An extra $5 if you've got pet hair in your car. Do they charge extra for human hair? Because we're all shedding, all the time... That seems like a rip off to me. Today will likely be the last day I come here."
Automotive,4.5,OR,The staff was so welcoming and friendly.  They were particular about the details in the car pre-wash and drying afterward.  The actual carwash is like an amusement park ride and kids will love it. Everything was sparkling and the vacuums were strong and convenient. The family who owns Fast Eddy's is wonderful and we love supporting their business.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Needed an oil change, air in my tires, and a blown fuse replaced and was able to get an appointment right away. Oil changes are easy here and affordable.

Automotive,4.5,CG,Absolutely fantastic customer service. It was an easy process and they did a great job. I would recommend to anyone looking for a car.I went to get a car wash and it was pretty bad. They had no clue what they were doing. I told the gentleman who helped me that I would be coming
Automotive,4.0,CG,Full service which is usually $35 and the oil change is $60 for a full synthetic oil change.  I had to get a full synthetic oil change and the first oil change took about an hour.  It took about 2 hours for them to do the oil change.  The first oil change took
Automotive,2.0,CG,I have had the same issues with the dealership and they are either incompetent or just a bunch of liars. I had a friend look at the vehicle and he told me it was fine but it was a little over priced. I will never buy from them again. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone
Automotive,2.5,CG,I'm not sure what's up here. The guys here are super friendly and helpful. I was just in for an oil change and I was out in under an hour. I was in and out in less than an hour. I'm a fan. I will be back for sure.
Automotive,3.5,CG,Contacted them on Wed. and asked if I could pick up the car on Wed. I was told to go get the car and I would be told by the manager that the car was sold that it was sold and that it would be ready on Wed. I was told that the car was not sold
Automotive,4.5,CG,"I recommend you take your vehicle to the dealership and try them out. If you have a vehicle, go see them. The people there are very friendly, knowledgeable, and take care of you. They are great at what they do.I had an amazing experience with this dealership. I was greeted by a"
Automotive,3.5,CG,James met us when we arrived. The dealership was very busy but we didn't have to wait. We had an appointment and the car was ready by the end of the day. The salesperson was extremely friendly and professional. We will definitely be back. I highly recommend you check them out.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I just purchased my second vehicle from Reno Buick GMC Cadillac. I test drove several vehicles and decided on a used Certified GMC Sierra. Harold was easy to work with, patient, and informative. I Financed a portion of the vehicle which was a very straight forward process and only took about an hour. I would recommend the dealer to a friend."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Purchased a 2015 GT Mustang a few weeks ago. Was PROMISED floor mats for the back. Guess once the ink is dry, wire transfer clears (paid cash), and commission has been paid, they figure they no longer need to follow thru with their end of the deal. Will definitely keep this in mind when people ask where I got my car..."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I worked with Skyler Cobb to locate a Tiguan.  At first, he was helpful locating the vehicle.  Then, when trying to close the sale, he became aggressive and manipulative, and a liar, which is exactly why I dislike most car salespeople.  I hung up our final phone conversation shaking.  I definitely won't give Boise Volkswagen my business."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I hadn't bought a new car at a dealership ever before coming to Seeger, Marc Wright made the progress extremely easy and without pushy sales tactics, Seeger has become a place that I have recommended to others. I love my new Toyota Camry and if I ever needed another car I would come to Seeger, I'm a Seeger customer for life!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I honestly would prefer giving them no stars. Went in for an inspection. They said 2 hours. After two hours, they told me I had problems so would need another hour. Then after that they told me another hour. The people are rude and barely try to help you. What a disgraceful establishment. I will never bring my car here again."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Looks really nice (haven't camped there), but their store is awesome, Especially their breakfasts (made to order breakfast sandwiches & burritos)! Very friendly people working there & really sell a lot of things. I pass park, gas station & store almost every day & had no clue they sold so much there until couple months ago! And gas is open 24/7."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I have been taking my car to Campanella's for several years now and have been very pleased with their services!  From new brake pads, muffler repair, and something as simple as tightening a loose part, they always do a great job.  They may be a little more pricey, but the location is convienant and the work is always gauranteed."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This is not a regular dealer. You can feel the difference the minute you walk in. We bought a certified pre-owned and Scott made the process easy from the start and provided excellent customer service. The show rooms have toys for the kids to play (small detail but as a parent who shopped with kids, it was awesome) definitely recommend them."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I paid 18$, which is the most expensive one. So I could get this jeep deep cleaned! There was a guy with long hair who greeted me & helped me pay the machine. The vacuum cleaner is already included! You just press the button every 10 minutes! There's trash cans connected to the vacuum machine! I highly recommend this place! :D"
Automotive,2.5,OR,I usually wash my own car but decided to try the Fairview Cash Wash.  I am so glad I did.  The service was excellent and quick.  The car was really clean!  The area where you wait was inviting and clean.  They also had a great selection of greeting cards.  I will certainly use them again.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Showed up to a line with a few cars where someone was just in a hurry to be first, basically cutting off 2 cars that should have been in front of them. Employees stood by and watched customers yell at and threaten each other while laughing over the headset. 

Time to find myself a new carwash where employees respect their customers."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"When I went into the dealership to meet with the salesman, Lance, I expected to have to confront the hard sell. Not so. I had seen the truck online the night before. Lance called in the morning. We set up an appointment for the same day. The entire staff treated me with friendliness and respect. Lance was very knowledgeable and fun."
Automotive,4.0,OR,I used them a couple weeks ago to install some tires that I bought online. Rob was really nice and made sure I got the best pricing for what I was coming in for. There was no pressure or up sale at all to purchase services I didn't need. Overall a great experience and I definitely will be using them again.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My car died in the same shopping center so I ended up here out of necessity. They were kind enough to let me borrow a jump pack to try and get my car running. Unfortunately, I ended up needing a new battery as my old one had a dead cell. Based on the experience they were honest, reliable and priced well."
Automotive,4.5,CG,"My experience has been with Mercedes of Cherry Hill, NJ.  I purchased a car from them.  The salesperson was nice, but the finance manager was not helpful.  The salesperson was rude and not willing to help.  I told him I was still waiting on the financing and he said """

Automotive,1.5,CG,"This is the worst gas station I've ever been to.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a woman and have a credit card. I've been taking my car there for over 30 years, and it's always very easy to find someone who is willing to help you"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Terrific shop, very friendly, professional, and fast.  I've been coming here for a couple of years now and I am very happy with the work they have done.  I would definitely go back to them again.  Thank you so much for being so professional and friendly!The staff was"
Automotive,2.5,CG,Stopped by the prior weekend and had the pleasure of working with a salesperson named Chris.  Chris is an exceptional salesperson.

They also had a good selection of new and used cars. "
Automotive,2.0,CG,It is against the law that a part is not part of the warranty that is not covered by the warranty. I had to get a rental car and the car was not fixed. The car had to be towed to a shop in Nashville for a repair. This is a farce for the vehicle.
Automotive,4.5,CG,It is pretty evident that this place is a scam. I will never ever go back to them. I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Sonata from the Lithia Hyundai of Reno store. The buying experience was fantastic. The experience was excellent. The sales staff was knowledgeable and helpful.

Automotive,3.0,CG,I wont be going back here. The guys here are very rude and unprofessional. I just wanted a simple oil change and I got a free tire rotation. This place is very shady and it's sad to know where to go.I had an amazing experience with this dealership. I was greeted by a very

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Amazing experience Robert in service department is a great man to deal with, very pleasant and helpful and always does above and beyond what is needed to make sure I am confident and content with my services, ferman Chevrolet must be very proud to have such an outstanding employee on there team. without him I don't know what I'd do."
Automotive,4.0,OR,Brian the GM of sales and Mike the GM of the dealership gave me the worst experience of my life. Full review will be posted soon but I felt compelled to give some comment now due to how my fiancé and I were treated. I would give zero or negative stars if yelp allowed. Do not waste your time with this dealership.
Automotive,2.0,OR,"What a terrible job. I guess they no longer use a pressure washer, for the lower door panels. I still have mud & snow slush on the bottom of the doors, and the windshield is dirty. I have been using this place for over 15 years. I now need to find a place that actually cares about the work they turn out."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Just bought a new $31k+ truck that I'm really enjoying despite the faulty tire pressure sensor, which has already gone wild. My salesman was very nice, but new to the job, so the deal was pretty much handed to the floor manger. All in all, I got an OK deal on my new truck, but I was totally JACKED on my trade."
Automotive,3.0,OR,Every single time I get my car cleaned at this car wash I have to ask the workers to go over a bunch of areas that they missed. It would be nice to come here and just have them get it right the first time.  Would go somewhere else but there are not a lot of car washes in the area.
Automotive,3.0,OR,Have never been treated so bad at a dealership.  Salesman was new and very nice. Was ready to buy 2 cars. I was buying a Lexus and family member a MDX.   Used car sales manager was rude and condescending.  Felt like I was at a cheap used car lot on a sitcom.  Stereotypic used car sales man.
Automotive,2.0,OR,Worst car wash ever. Barely ok on the outside (lots of spots) and horrible in the inside. Mats were wet and got the carpet dirty and there were black rubber marks where none existed before. Managed to leave the car dirtier than when I brought it in. Avoid at all costs - there are much better places to go to in Boise.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Took my car here for preventive maintenance work based on the reviews seen here on Yelp. Was not disappointed! Had tune up, cooling system service and transmission serviced for the price of a tune up alone at the dealership. And the final price was less than quoted! Donnie is professional, courteous and honest. I will be back and recommend Mark's to everyone!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,My wife and I just purchased our new 2013 Ford Edge from Wayne at C&C Ford. We had such a great experience. Wayne spent the time with us to go over all the features of the car and was extremely knowledgeable. He stayed late that evening to make sure my wife was comfortable in her new Edge. I highly recommend this dealership.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"As always, great service.  Adam (owner) really goes above and beyond, does whatever it takes to make it as pleasant as possible.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"This Pep Boys is one of our go-to stores for oil, wipers, and other necessities for the vehicles.  We've been shopping here for many years.  We have brought our cars here for service in the past, but nowadays, we usually end up at our buddy's shop instead.  But still, great place to pick up whatever else you may need."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"We trust Schummer Sunoco with our automobiles, even though it's not in our neighborhood. We've always been treated with respect and never been ""upsold"" like many of the chain shops tend to do. We get consistent and timely feedback after a diagnosis and after 5 years of service, I can say that I've never had a complaint about their workmanship. 100% recommended."
Automotive,3.0,OR,Could be a Jersey thing but still maddening. There are no guys available to wash a car today because it's cloudy? And then the sun comes out and they can wash it but can't clean the interior? So basically I lost 45 minutes from an hour long lunch break and got have the job done. Two steps forward and one step back.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"There's a level of ""humanism"" with Bryan at Midnight Waxers- he just gets it.  Prompt, convenient, competitive pricing.  His system is amazing and ideal for a last minute wash.  Has come to my apartment garage, maybe a dozen times in the middle of the night and gotten my car spotless for the next morning.  Can't recommend them enough."
Automotive,4.0,OR,Been here several times and aways great service.  I know very little about my car and they always explain anything that seems questionable.  They have all the recommended service requirements for almost all brands so they know what the factory recommendation for my car require.  Fast and friendly service.  I highlky recommend this location  it's smoke free!
Automotive,5.0,CG,I just had my 2006 Mercedes GLK 350 serviced here.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The waiting area is comfortable and they have a comfortable area to sit in.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that they were able to get me in and out quickly.  I was in and out

Automotive,2.0,CG,"This car wash does a good job and the workers are very friendly. However, the vacuum job is a complete waste of time. The guys that work the front end are always very rude and don't care about the customer. I will never use them again and will be sure to never use them again."
Automotive,3.0,CG,Recommend you steer clear of this place.  I went in to get my tire patched and they told me that they had to replace a valve stem and that they didn't have time to look at it.  I asked if I could bring it back in and they said they would have it done in 2 days.
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Thank you Thomas Murman for your excellent service.We just bought a new car and the process was quick and painless.

Automotive,3.0,CG,I had some time to go to the dealership and try to purchase a new car. I got the car I wanted and the salesmen said they could get me into a new car and that it was a great deal. I said no and went to the dealership to test drive the car. They gave me the keys

My car was returned to me looking brand new!I had an excellent experience at Precision Toyota. I was greeted with friendly and knowledgeable staff. I had a very pleasant
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This place is ok for a basic car wash. I was unimpressed with their high end ""detailing"". I paid for a full detail on my truck. There was still dirt on my floor mats and the windows were streaked. If you just want a basic wash, this place is good. If you want a deep clean, do it yourself or go somewhere else."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Thank you Crystal SO much for helping me today! I was very anxious about my car needing more oil and you were so knowledgeable and helped me! And quickly too!

Automotive,3.5,OR,Went there to have a flat tire fixed.  They told me that it was unrepairable and that my warranty was with another big o franchise and that they can't honor the warranty.    I took the tire to ge big o on ina and was told that they could fix it.  I'll take the drive to get better service.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"If you want a nice used car at a fair price, don't go here. They're not willing to negotiate price or work with you on anything. In fact, if you work with Steve and he doesn't like the price you're offering, be prepared to witness his anger. It's incredibly childish & unprofessional, but that's how they are there. I will never go back."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Took my Lexus HS here, after having it checked at Lexus.  I was quoted $6200 for a transmission from Lexus, and Tampa Hybrids tested and found it that it wasn't actually the transmission but the inverter. Cost was dramatically less ($1200).  Work was done quickly and I am back on the road .  Very pleased with the service and reliability."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This was my first experience with the ""instant oil change"".  Upon arrival I didn't know it was literally instant, like drive thru, stay in your car the whole time and you're out in minutes!  Technicians are friendly, professional, educated on their products and extremely thorough.  Highly recommended, will be back.  Next time I'll snag a Groupon 24 hours before!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,We've been going here for years with our diesel Mercedes. You MUST have a knowledgeable mechanic for these cars and Tommy is terrific. He and Gerry know euro cars and Diesel engines. They are fair in pricing their work. Chris and Dave handle the communications and part procurement in a no nonsense manner. They consistently under promise and over deliver. Would strongly recommend.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Great service, they were all very friendly and worked together well. Kept me informed on how long the wait would be but was faster than estimated.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""

I know that car dealers are not always the cream of the crop as far as doing business goes, but these guys are pretty good.  I had a pleasant shopping, test driving, and buying experience.  

My Advice:
Go here first, they're the best.  My personal experience was with Steven Laughlin, he truly is a good guy."
Automotive,2.5,OR,This is one of the worst rest stops I've ever been to. There was a long line of cars to get in even though there was plenty of parking. The line for the bathroom snakes around the entire inside and I just left. I'd rather pee outside than wait 40 minutes to use a restroom kids have peed all over the floor in.
Automotive,3.5,OR,Worst customer service ever! I made an appointment for an oil change at this location and they were not as busy as the day before when I tried to come there. After 45 minutes of waiting they took back my car to start my oil change. What is the point of making an appointment if you have to wait for 45 minutes anyways....
Automotive,1.5,OR,"I have yet to ever call a place and me treated like crap because they are overwhelmed with work! Guy says he can't swap 4 tires that I am taking the wheels to him on 14"" trailer wheels. Then he first tells me $10 and then changes his mind to $20 per tire. Not going to waste my time with this scum bag."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Pleasant & friendly enough, but charged me $300 for a tune-up that didn't address the problem I brought my Jeep in for originally.  Charges close to $100/hr for labor & told me to bring my Jeep back in when the check engine light goes on so they can figure out what the problem is.  I'm never bringing my vehicles there again."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"What a great experience, I sold my vehicle to them with no pressure to buy another vehicle! They gave me the best deal in town even in the Phoenix area! My salesman was Fernando, he was excited to help me even knowing I washing going to buy a car. Just because of that I will be back to buy a car from him!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I've found items usually ship quickly and as are advertised.  The struts for our Subaru were as advertised.  Over the years I've found they do a decent job except for the plethora of catalogs they feel like you need.  

Hey Summit - It's like the yellow pages - catalogs are DEAD.  Improve your website and save some resources PLEASE."
Automotive,4.5,CG,I was recommended by a friend of mine and she recommended this place. I have a 2012 Ford Explorer that I am very happy with. I took it to a couple other places and it was worth the price. It was a very busy day and I had to get it back in for the day. The day I picked

Automotive,5.0,OR,This place is awesome. Both the owner (Laurie) and Corrine are the real deal. I had my 2008 xterra and my girlfriends 2008 Land Rover detailed. Their attention to detail was impeccable. Both cars looked brand new. They communicated constantly about when the car would be finished so I could schedule the pick-up.  Don't go anywhere else when you need your car detailed
Automotive,4.5,OR,"They are fantastic - thorough and precise, high level of personal service, attention to detail - excellent quality.  I have had them work on my Bmw 640 two times, both severe damage from other drivers. I could not be happier with the results and recommend them highly.  Happy and Victor and their entire staff could not have been more gracious and accommodating."
Automotive,3.5,OR,These guys will pull out every sales trick in the book on you if you're not careful.  When they ask you to come in to pick up your car make sure you settle on an exact time and that you'll want to sign the papers immediately.  Otherwise they'll purposely keep you waiting so you'll be less inclined to read through your paperwork.
Automotive,3.5,OR,Since day one when I bought my 2020 Honda Civic my experience has been fantastic I get my oil change every time at Westshore Honda and my boy will just gives an outstanding customer service he walks you too an from your car opening your door he's kind an friendly and also very understanding every time I schedule I make sure it's with will

Automotive,5.0,OR,"These guys know their stuff, and they're honest. What more do you need from a car place? The shop, like it's mechanics, is a little rough around the edges, but they do good work. As someone who doesnt know much about cars, have often felt like places are trying to swindle me or take advantage... not this place. They are efficient, trustworthy and reliable."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Bob Lee is one of the last gems for mechanical work here is downtown St Pete.  They did a great job on my Acura, were transparent on the cause and the cost, and super sensitive to my needs to get the car back the same day. At the end the complete brake job cost me less than any other quotes from local shops."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Purchased a beautiful previously owned vehicle through JOHNNY BILLIRIS.  The process was smooth, above and beyond service was also provided and HE was very attentive to my needs, questions and concerns.  All vehicle purchases take time - the waiting area was clean, roomy and water/coffee was made readily available.  Johnny Billiris will be my permanent and direct contact at this dealership."
Automotive,4.0,OR,The heat was horrible and the employees do not have any cooling for themselves. These people deserve better. They were kind and wonderful and I sure hope that someone in corporate knows how hot it gets in Tucson. They need at least a big swamp cooler. I was so please with the service that I will go back and definitely recommend them to others.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Kevin is efficient, his pricing is fair yet competitive and he is Honest!  He will discuss your bet option with any repair.

Automotive,2.0,OR,They have slowly gotten worse here. I pay for the works and they do the bare minimum. The back of my car was filthy. Didn't even look like it had been vacuumed. The works comes with a fragrance and there wasn't any of that. My cup holders were not cleaned out. I'm done with this car wash. I will be taking my business elsewhere.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"It's a bit of a drive from where we live but it was worth it. Honda Crown has excellent customer service and their staff is friendly and professional. It was an excellent experience. Serg (sp?)  was our sales associate and he was terrific. In fact, everyone was terrific.  I recommend them to all our friends and family now.  They're that good."

Automotive,4.5,OR,I had originally gone to the Jiffy Lube on German Church road and waited 10 mins and no one greeted me or informed me or the wait time.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"The services are great at a fair price, but if you have any questions, a dispute or generally just need to reach someone by phone, don't expect anyone to answer OR call you back.

Wifi, comfortable chairs and great atmosphere. Highly recommend."
Automotive,3.5,OR,I called and the waiting time was supposed to be an hour and I waiting for over 3 hours and when I called in they said the driver was still on the way.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"I've taken 2 different cars to this location 3 times, all for minor issues.  One was insurance (dented bumper), and the other two were so minor I did self-pay.

What a bunch of hacks.

They forgot to top off fluids and create false problems that have been proven untrue when evaluated by multiple other mechanic shop.

If you love your vehicle don't look anyplace else, great price, nice people and fabulous work."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Don't go into the automatic wash. Called and texted the guy because the machine malfunctioned but no response.

Will definitely be doing business with Dan and Honda of Fishers again and recommend you do the same.  Great experience. No regrets."
Automotive,4.5,OR,In an industry that takes advantage of customers from time to time.  They never try to upsell me on things i really don't need and if there's an issue with the repair that they did they respond and fix it.

Imagine if my kid was in the car with me and he hit me
Automotive,2.0,OR,"2 stars only because they did not have what I was looking for!!!


The staff didn't even speak upon my entrance into the store, or ask me if I needed help with anything. She watched me wonder around like a chicken without a head looking for something.

When I did  find the area I needed, as mentioned, they did not have what I was looking for. bummer."
Automotive,3.0,CG,Driving through town with our family and the car died. I called AAA and they got me towed to a local mechanic. The guy who helped us out was extremely friendly and helpful.

Automotive,4.0,CG,I've found this place to be an absolute rip off. I will never ever go there again and will tell everyone I know to never go there. The worst customer service I've ever experienced.The customer service is excellent.  I've been coming here for years and I've never had a problem.  They have a fair price

Automotive,4.5,CG,"These guys saved my weekend. They helped me with my car's timing belt replacement, and even stayed late to make sure the car was running smoothly. The work was done in a timely manner. I highly recommend this place. I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service from the people that work here."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Even though they have horrible customer service, they are just saying they don't have the customer service to do so.  The people who work here are the most unprofessional, and most unprofessional people I have ever dealt with.  If you are going to use this company, do not use it.  They are the most un"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Employees here are as good as it gets. 

I love that they have a shuttle to take you to the airport. The shuttle also takes you to the terminal. I've been to many other car rental companies and I've always had a great experience. I've had several different experiences with them and have never had any"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"We've been bringing our 3 cars here for years and they've always been fair, honest and reasonable. They are always very accommodating and will always give you the best advice. They've never tried to upsell me on something I don't need. They have always been very upfront and honest with me. I've never had to leave"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"After a terrible experience with this dealership, I'd give them a zero if I could. 

I had the pleasure of speaking with Aaron, the sales manager. He was courteous, professional and helpful. He took the time to explain everything and make sure I understood everything. 

I ended up going to another"
Automotive,4.5,CG,I don't think I've ever had an issue with them. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change.  The guy was not happy about it and was just trying to make a sale. I will never go back. This is my second time going here and I will not be going back
Automotive,4.5,CG,I've been going to Steve's for a couple years now and I'm always happy with the service and the prices. I had a bad experience with another shop that was not happy about it and now it's my go to place. I will always recommend them. I will be back.I would give a zero if I could.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Setting an appointment online was super easy. They have sanitizer available throughout the lobby and outside. All staff were wearing masks which I appreciate. Although you can't wait there, they did have a canopy outside. Victor was helpful and his customer service was excellent. To close out, they send you links on your phone to avoid unnecessary contact due to COVID. I would highly recommend Big Brand."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"My son has been recommending Gary to us for a few months. Came to price having my front break pad replaced, Gary gave me a reasonable estimate compared to others in area. Then he said if I wanted to buy them myself and bring back, he'd put them on for a very good price! Did that and he took me right in! We'll be back for sure!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Still would never recommend this place to anyone ! Very unprofessional group of non experienced people that doesn't care for your business ,  one day they will mess with the wrong person and get their butt sued. They're a bunch of liars, if they can get away with messing up your car they will ! I would tell everyone to go elsewhere! This place sucks !"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Do not buy at this location! Not only did they send my financial documents to another customer, after our car was returned to us( after 2 weeks of dealing with multiple low level personnel with no action being put into place) we found they damaged the transmissions lines without repairing it or informing us of this. Clearly customer service is a foreign concept, as is customer safety."
Automotive,4.5,OR,Brought my tacoma in for an alignment after i installed a lifted suspension.  they got me right in and had me out in an hour and a half with everything in spec.  Everyone was super friendly.  They also gave a good recommendation for an exhaust shop since they don't do it themselves.  Will be bringing my subaru in when it's due for alignment.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I purchased a new VW yesterday, and have to say it was the easiest and most pleasant experience I have ever had purchasing a car.  I worked with Danit Klovsky and she was nothing but a true professional.  I told her what I was looking for and she went to work and surpassed my expectations!  I can't recommend her highly enough!  
Thanks, Danit!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,This is our second time having Fidel service our family's vehicles and he and the staff are unbelievable. My car runs like new and he did an amazing amount of work for a very fair price. Incredible attention to detail! I cannot say enough good things about this shop. And the people there welcome you like family.  This was a fantastic experience all the way around.
Automotive,1.5,OR,I can't express enough how much hate I have for this place how the fucked me over and there's nothing I can do about it I'm tempted to just run my Fuckin car right inside the fuckin dealer shit that's how much I hate these fuckin bitches I feel so robbed if I ever come back here these people will get the biggest fuckin beat down !
Automotive,5.0,OR,First time going to rays and they definitely did a great job fixing my wife's jeep!  Not only were they able to fix the engine issues the jeep was having but while it was there he fixed a muffler issue I had due to another shop installing it incorrectly.  Great pricing and speedy work even on short notice.  Would definitely recommend them to others!
Automotive,4.0,OR,Red headed worker with ponytail who drives a White Ford Explorer pickup was going half the speed limit without hazards and shouted obscenities / vulgar gestures as vehicles attempted to pass. Beyond unprofessional for a local business with drivers driving through congested residential areas. Beware of the class of people working here. Think what they'd do to your vehicle if you upset them.

And it was as he stated.  He also alerted me to a nail a had in a tire....Mike and the rest if the crew was TOPS!!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"This was my first time here and I was hesitant after seeing a few bad reviews in a row, but I have to say - that was not my experience. My technician Ty was friendly and helpful. He explained that I actually needed more than just an oil change but I never felt pressured to get those services immediately at their location. I would recommend to others!"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Worst customer service ever....and total waste of my time and money.

If you want to waste time and money on the phone, then this is the place to go. They should be ashamed of themselves.

Automotive,1.5,CG,"I am giving this location a 1 star because the service was great. However, I was just in for an oil change and I was told that they have a ""good"" deal on oil changes.

Automotive,2.0,CG,Great service and communication. Becca and Greg are the best. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change.

Automotive,2.5,CG,Had a 1000am appointment. Got there early and they were able to fix it for a reasonable price. The other two employees had a bad attitude.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"Used action Nissan service many times. The last time I was in Reno, I was told by the service manager that the service technician must have hit something on the passenger side of the car that it was a safety issue. I'm not sure why.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"If you're looking for a mechanic in the Roxborough area, look no further. These guys are kind, honest, and do everything in the customer's best interest. If you don't know a lot about cars, they'll explain everything to you and won't try to get you to do something you don't need. My fiancé and I will be coming here for as long as we live in this area!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I let my car get way out of control but these guys rocked it and now I feel like I'm driving a new car again!

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Excelent dealership in Tampa. Outstanding service for a top quality brand. As a regular customer, I've had the pleasure to interact with most of the service advisors, as well as many Sales Representatives. Everyone is been very professional and kind.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"* they told me they will fix everything in the car, but they didn't even do half of the work.

* some of the paint was taken off the body due to polishing in a bad way.
*Will never come again"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Fast and free shipping.  Awesome website UI and customer cart.  Efficient online chat customer support.  Summit has done me well building three classic mustangs. Their team is friendly and has helped me numerous times with custom part orders. Nine out of ten times they get it right, but if there is ever an issue, returns are super easy and quick.  I'm a happy customer."
Automotive,4.5,OR,We got a flat tire a little before 4pm on a Friday afternoon. My wife called Paul's and was told that if I got there before 5pm he'd most likely be able to put a new tire on our car. We got there with a few minutes to spare (pardon the pun); Paul and his staff were fast workers and very gracious to us out-of-towners. Would definitely recommend.
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Best car wash for the price I have found in town. Why?  Automated, vacuums included, clean rags and windex included, not crowded, great service. Wish these guys had more stores around town.  For 7 bucks you cannot beat this place.  Close to L&L drive in too... So you can get some ono grinds and then go wash your car. Ok,  that's my plan anyway."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Parked here for a decade, including my 23 employees. I came home from Dallas to find someone hit my three week old work truck, so I filed an incident report. After years of customer loyalty I didn't even get an email, just silence. Since Covid the average wait is almost 30 minutes so it's time to move on anyway. Do yourself a favor and avoid this terrible business."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"2 tires and 1 alignment = two trips to pep boys, 8 hours of waiting in a dirty hot waiting room.  1 star for the manager who tried to fix the alignment the second time and did... but id rater spend the 40-50 extra bucks other places charge bc 8 hours of my life is just not worth it. Seriously.. not kidding.. 8 hours.. two 4-hour trips..."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Second time I've been here and second time I've been dazzled. Gabriel and his entire staff are AMAZING. Friendly confident in their knowledge and the ability to back it up! I come here for oil changes every time it's needed and Gabriel always reminds me to ""find the coupon"". This time he found it for me! They are just great! It's so nice to find an honest mechanic!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This location has the best customer service! Our car broke down right as we were about to head home to Atlanta on Labor Day. We had trouble finding a place that was open but when we called, they put us in line and we were serviced right away. We were told it would be a five hour wait time which ended up being one. They were so great!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"They quoted me $3,000 for a lot of work that didn't need to be done, were rude when I said I would get a second opinion, and then tried scare tactics to talk me out of it, telling me my wheels would fall off if I drove it off the lot. And all this after an impossibly brief inspection. I got a second opinion and you should too."
Automotive,4.5,OR,I had a great experience taking my car here. They were able to help me immediately and treated me with respect. I was strained for time and they were able to meet my needs. When they found the problem they recommended me to get it fixed for free under warranty and only charged a small diagnostics fee. I would take my vehicle back here again without a doubt.
Automotive,2.0,OR,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE. Between the horrible service and shady ""help"" I don't know what was worse. I took my car in for a routine oil change, and had no problems with it. The minute it left the shop it suddenly had two flat tires. I highly doubt this is coincidence considering how they treated me. The place stinks of greed and dishonesty. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I bought a used Honda Ruckus here.  I got a great deal and they really took care of me with a repair issue.  Couldn't recommend them more highly.  This is a really cool, old school motorcycle shop with lots of scooters and motorcycles for sale too.  You'll find some old scoots and motorcycles for sale here.  They can fix anything.  Good people."
Automotive,4.0,OR,Great people and dependable services!  Would Highly recommend this company! I have depended on this company and the mechanics to take care of my older car and now my newer used car.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"Just bought a 2014 Honda CR-V Ex from Crest. We had a great experience. The customer service was on point, and we really appreciate that there wasn't a huge mark up on the vehicles we looked at. The waiting area was fantastic. Lots of seats, a play room for the kids, fountain drink machine, free popcorn and hot dogs, wifi, charging ports for your phone. It was great."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"My favorite place to get a new car. Great prices too. Also, great people!I've been using Bommarito for over 10 years, and have never had a problem.

Automotive,2.5,CG,Just wanted to share the experience with you guys. I will admit that I was a bit nervous about my first visit to the dealership. My car was not in great shape and I had to take it in to have it repaired. I had a lot of issues with the vehicle and was looking at a few different cars.
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Don't go here if you are a woman.

Automotive,3.0,CG,For service department only: the receptionist (I hope you know how to make a reservation) and the other two employees (i.e. the manager) are not in the same position.  They are in the same position as the other one.  This is a farce for the service department.  I have to leave a review
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Never again!  Extremely expensive, and will never go back. If you want to go to a dealer, go to the Honda Dealership in the North Penn area. This is the place to go. I can't imagine how this place would stay in business."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Cal-Nevada Towing got us out of there within an hour. They were polite, efficient, and efficient. We are so thankful for the great service and the great customer service.

I'll be spending the extra money to have my car serviced at a local shop that takes pride in their work.

I will be sure to update this review after I have the vehicle serviced.

"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Haik and Kurt are honest and helpful. You can trust your vehicle to them for repairs -- I've been using them for 2.5 years for all sorts of things.
They did recommend a repair once that I found out from a friend (who owns his own repair shop in another city) is totally unnecessary, but I chalk it up to difference of opinion...all in all, Kurt REALLY knows his stuff."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Had a great experience with Russ and the shop when I had to stop in for repairs on my Honda.  He went the extra mile to diagnose and help me out. I found an excellent mechanic who's reasonably priced and a fantastic guy to work with.  If you like to support small business, get a good value and quality work - make your next appointment at Vern's."
Automotive,3.5,OR,Great place to go looking for any car! I had been looking for a new used car for over a month. And Tim was patient with me for 3+ WEEKS. Everyone there was super friendly and fun. I must have tried at least 7 cars there and not once was I pushed into a car nor was I rushed. I'm looking forward to working with them in the future.
Automotive,3.5,OR,This is my fourth time using A-1 and their service and friendliness keeps us coming back. This trip we landed much later than usual and the van was super fast to respond to pick us up after we made our phone call to them as instructed when dropping our car off. The price is always reasonable and I will continue to use them for all my airport parking needs...
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Independence Auto Sales has a great selection of cars at low prices. We purchased a used Hyundai Sonata that was in great shape with low mileage.  The salesman, Adam, was honest and helpful. My father and I couldn't be happier about finding their site through cars.com and getting a car here. Overall, we are very satisfied, and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a used car."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Great experience, good people who really try to help and work with you! David Spinieo really helped me through the whole process, was a great, genuine guy to purchase a vehicle from! Never felt pressured and felt confident it was a good deal. Kristin Mark did a great job financing my car and really went out of her way to get what I wanted. Would recommend Bergey's to anyone!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"DO NOT TRUST. I wish I could give them negative stars. Took my BMW there, thinking I could trust the service, since a woman co-owned it. Turns out they told me that I needed a bunch of unnecessary flushes and items. A BMW specific mechanic told me later that I had done repairs that were superfluous.  Sad that this is how this company choose to treat its customers."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I stopped in for an oil change on a whim and true to the name I was out in a ""jiffy"" (and there were two customers ahead of me). Total time was about 25-30 minutes. There was great customer service-they were very friendly and knowledgeable and not too pushy with any up selling-just honest about what needed replacement etc. I'm very happy with my experience and I'll be back."
Automotive,4.0,OR,The last and only place to get a carwash by a team of happy staff. They do the best job any carwash has to offer in reno. I will only come here after a the let down and squandered money spent at the only other 2 non self carwashes in Reno. Great owner workes in the treaches right beside his team of staff. Great experience and the clean restrooms.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Simply the best auto place I have ever been to. I went in for a simple oil change and they didn't try and treat it like anything else. There were no attempts to scare me with things they just ""happened to notice"" needed repair and they didn't dally around letting me cool my heels. I'd describe this shop and the people that work there as friendly, professional, and efficient."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Unprofessional and dangerous! Was just cut off on the skyway approach by their driver. Had to jam on my brakes not to hit the idiot, not cool, especially since i was transporting a patient in a wheelchair. Had to stop at rest area to adjust customer in wheelchair. If this is how he drives empty, I'd hate to see what happens when you trust your $40000 Harley to them."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"So disappointing to try and work with this company. They wasted my time this week, by not following up on a sales offer. They also provided my car back to me, after an oil service, with a deep scratch. The free $0 car service is worth exactly that, $0. Thanks for the streaks, incomplete cleaning and crap effort. Not sure the free oil change is worth all the aggravation."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"We have been dealing with Davidsons for almost 30years and have found both brothers to be courteous, knowledgable , and above all else , helpful and understanding during what normally is a trying time. The owner is someone I would trust. Just as you would not openly second guess a doctor, nor should you try that with the owner of the best body shop in the tri state area."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Michael picked up my motorcycle in the French Quarter and transported it to Hall's Motorsport over in Harvey, really getting me out of a bind during the week of Thanksgiving.  He was friendly and professional, and kept me in the loop the whole way.  Really saved my bacon and treated my motorcycle as if it were his own.  Would highly recommend!  Also, very reasonably priced."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Professional, friendly and courteous describes the way my daughter and I were treated here.  Went in on a Saturday morning to look around and left with a 2015 Forester after Ken Murch helped us look over the inventory, learn more about the various models and took us on a lengthy test drive that included a brief stint on I-10.  Every aspect of our experience was top notch."
Automotive,4.5,OR,This location is a joke when it comes to towing. If you are not getting work done at their shop your time for the tow grows. Called in for a tow quoted an hour. Time passed called asking the delay and was told this is busiest day of the year and they can't pick up anymore. No proactive customer service and alerting the consumer at all. Worse tow company.

He listened to my needs and wants. I felt like I had been treated fairly. I will continue to do business with them."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Molasses slow.  With one vehicle in the shop, you're in and out in about 45 minutes.  If you want to get your car fixed right the first time, you should go to this place.  It's a little pricey for a car repair and you're waiting for the next vehicle.  If you have to go somewhere"

Automotive,3.5,OR,This was my first time coming here and I wish I would have been coming here a lot sooner! I had been out of town for a week with my dogs at the lake so the amount of matted dog hair everywhere was disgusting.

Automotive,5.0,OR,"Great place for a smog check!  Fernando was very friendly and quickly greeted me even though he was working on something at the time.  The check itself was quick and thorough without an appointment, about 15 minutes.  He thoughtfully turns the car around for you so it's easy to drive out.  I didn't use any other services, but I highly recommend this business for smog checks."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Pro: No other car wash in the Reno/Sparks area is more thorough.
Con: Their attention to detail requires a longer wait. In a hurry, not here.

Interaction from the staff is mostly limited to a cashier who I always find offering a positive vibe. Do wish they would reopen the store. Would drink some teas in there that I always enjoyed. And bringing the shoeshine stand back, so impossible to find anymore???"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Prices are ridiculous. This is what they charged me for putting on one brake caliper and one pad. On a 2003 GMC Envoy. $760.14
This is totally wrong. At over a $145 an hour to put one brake caliber on. They ought to be ashamed of themselves....and they say it took 3.6 hours to do it!

"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Don't waste your time going here. Prices online have a hidden cost of $1000. After I made a cashier check out to them for 9,000. Bill still would not remove the hidden cost. Bill seemed to be a nice guy, but he must think it's the 80's. People just don't deal like that anymore. You can't change the price after you have the customer at the location. Don't waste the trip"

Automotive,4.5,OR,I had some work done to a 2014 Ram pickup and they did a great job at a fair price. I took it in on a Monday and got it back on Thursday. Looks like new. The gentleman who took care of me was Mike and he was easy to deal with. The repair is guaranteed for life and I highly recommend them for any auto body work you may need.
Automotive,1.5,OR,I would give this place less than one star if it was possible. The wait time is super long and they only have one person who can manage the check in of a car. Are there no other competent people in this service. Avoid at all cost. There are so many better places to have your at checked in Philadelphia. Or go to Delaware. This is not the place to go.

Overall I would highly recommend Fred Beans and Jeep."

Automotive,2.0,OR,I have been going here for several years since it close to my home.  NO longer!  After waiting for my car to be completed they drove my car off to a parking lot.  No waving of a towel!  No honking of the horn!  Just sheer arrogance.  I will go an extra few mile and patronize a different car wash.  PS - over priced compared to competitors.
Automotive,2.5,OR,I will always come to this location for any work done on my Jeep going further!!! Went in for a simple oil change and tire rotation... they discovered a broken part from my previous oil change done at a competitor ( rhymes with fall-mart). They went above and beyond to fix the situation and get me back on the road.  They have a great team working there! Great work-Great price! Thanks Guys!
Automotive,2.5,OR,Jim McGinly is the most knowledgeable and friendly mechanic I have ever had the pleasure of using.   He is courteous and knows what he is doing.  I feel like he has my back and I know that my car repairs are being done properly and that my car is in its best possible working condition.  If you are going to Pep Boys ask for him to service your car!
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Their location is mostly one-way in (southbound on Oracle) and one-way out (again only southbound on Oracle) which makes them try harder perhaps? I received a free car wash coupon from a dealer so I tried them and I got a full upgrade for only $5 extra PLUS the receipt was good for a whole new car wash within a week, NOT just a rain check deal as with other car wash businesses."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM HERE OR HAVE YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE! I bought my car over a year ago, and they can't seem to fix my cars ongoing issue. They have put me through the runner with everything. 

I don't have a lot of regrets in life, but one would for sure be buying a ""certified"" vehicle from them when they did not report a prior accident it had been in"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Center Square motors is the very best body shop! Butch and his crew are very professional, do excellent work and often go above and beyond with little extra details which significantly enhance the looks of the autos. 
Their pricing is very competitive and very reasonable . I have been taking all of my family's cars there for over 20 years , including four BMWs two Acuras and a Lexus. I highly recommend them!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Peter was super friendly and did great work on my car. My air conditioning stopped working while driving down from Massachusetts and he fit me in the same day I called so that I could drive back up to Massachusetts with a working air conditioner. My final price was $150 less than his original estimate. I was really happy with the repair, the price, and the time it took to get it done."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This place is my go to for car repairs!!! They are honest and trustworthy. They won't try to take money from you with unnecessary repairs like some other car places. Just recently they saved me about $1500 off what another car place told me I would have to pay to repair my vehicle. They are kind, knowledgeable and willing to help with anything. I recommend to everyone and will continue to do so."
Automotive,5.0,OR,I was and first time customer and will definitely be coming back. I made a same day appointment and they took me right away when I got there. I stayed and watched as they changed my oil and rotated my tires he explained everything as he went and was very friendly. Plus I shopped around ahead of time and he by far has the best prices. Overall best experience at a service shop.
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Pretty typical car buying experience. We have been to many dealerships in the past, and this one was a great one. The people there were very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. We were able to get our car in and out in less than an hour and for a great price. I would recommend this place to anyone!They are terrible. I made an appointment"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Honestly I've been through many car washes with the same issues. 

The first time I went, I had a bad experience.  The car was not vacuumed, and the attendant came over and said that the machine was dirty.  This was not the case.  I had a 2 day rental car to return, and had to wait on the"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"When it comes to carmax, it's the only place in town that will give you the best service.

I had a bad experience with the dealership, and I'm sure it's because of the fact that the salespeople are horrible. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought my vehicle. I was also disappointed with the finance manager, and he"
Automotive,2.0,CG,The few shuttles that are here have been the best. I will continue to use this location for all my automotive needs. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I bought a used car from this dealership. I told them I would like to do a car inspection and to check the oil. I had a 2 hour wait time to get in the car.
Automotive,2.0,CG,"A local car dealership messed up my car after a part was installed. When I got home, the other two employees had missed the part. I called the dealership and spoke to the manager and told him that I had a rental car for the day and that I would have to pay a higher fee because I didn't want to pay a higher fee."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"These guys sold me my car with the wrong oil. I will never ever go back to them.I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Elantra from Tires Plus. I was very pleased with my purchase. I spoke with Paul, who was very professional and helpful. The car was clean and well maintained. I will definitely be returning.I have been to a"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"If I said that I would have given them 0 stars I would. This is the worst experience I have ever had. The people there are very rude, and the only reason I go back is because I have been in the past 3 times. If I could give negative stars I would.I was looking to purchase a new vehicle and I had a very positive experience at"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I bought a brand new Mercedes GLK 350 yesterday. I will not be buying a car from this dealership again. The salesmen are very knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and helpful.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"This applies only to their customer service and quality of work.

My car was left with a major issue.  The front of my car is running like a dream.  The front of the car is covered in paint and a bit of body damage.  I was given a quote of $3,000 to fix it, which was $3,000 less"

Automotive,2.5,CG,My wife forgot that her car key was in the ignition.  She called the dealership and they told her that they had to replace the key and then the key would be in the ignition.  They had her call the police and they sent a police officer out to tow the car.  We were told that they were going to charge her $500 for a key that
Automotive,4.0,OR,Took a BIG rock right in my line of sight. Called Safelite and they got me in the next day while we were visiting. In and out in 45 minutes. Everyone was great. Only thing I REALLY DISLIKE is that their phone numbers all go to a central location. I want to talk to the people doing the work. Its a poor model IMHO. All that said I would still use Safelite without reservation.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"After leaving a negative review regarding my experience, the service manager, Fred, called me to explain that they did not believe changing their work resulted in the damaged air conditioner. He offered to fix the air conditioner at a discount ($600) to resolve the misunderstanding. Fred was attentive and work was done quickly. I appreciate the call and the goodwill of the team to reach out to a skeptical customer. I will be back!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I took my car to Borst Automotive for a second opinion on three major maintenance recommendations I had received from the dealer's service shop following an oil change. Borst's quote for the work was 2/3 the dealer's quote. Upon completing their independent diagnostic inspection, Borst's assessment was that none of the work was required. I truly appreciate their honest assessment and I will surely go back to Borst when maintenance work is indeed required."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Still my go to stop for honest, quick repairs!  You can call ahead for an appointment or they can give you a time estimate if you just drop by!  They've done work on cars for all drivers in the family for all of our vehicles for almost 5 years now.  The waiting room is clean and comfortable, the staff is friendly and honest, and the service is the Best in Tampa."
Automotive,4.5,OR,Just had my inspection done today and was very pleases! The pick up/drop off service was such a nice add on. The customer service is great and very professional.

This will absolutely be the new spot I go when I need any work done!!!
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Went here on Saturday and had a really good experience! Worked with Patrick and Rizk. Rizk is the man he was very helpful and knowledgeable about the vehicles he was showing us.

You guys are the BEST!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Neal Turoff was a pleasure to work with!  We just bought a used Honda Odyssey and his customer service was great!  The transaction was quick and easy from start to finish.  They now offer a warranty on used cars up to 100,000 miles at ZERO cost!  If thats not standing behind a product not sure what is?  I will be buying my next car from crown that's for sure!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"An $18 oil change just turned into $40. What they advertise is not the case. I asked to include a car wash because their sign said it would only be $24 for a wash and oil change. However, I was then told the machine is broken so they wanted to up charge me $10 more for a hand wash. First and last time coming here. There are too many places on Kennedy to return."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Overall a solid service when I needed it.

Windshield cracked in extreme heat one day which obviously sucks, but from the online scheduling to the service the next day these guys did a great job.  In and out in less than 1.5 hours on a day when it was 95 degrees out.  Sucks I had to pay close to $400 but not sure if I had a choice.  Convenience is key here."
Automotive,5.0,OR,Was rear ended in my Range Rover with extensive damage. My concern was would it be repaired to factory standards? The answer is- absolutely! These guys do excellent work. Justin kept me updated throughout the process and handled my insurance efficiently. They coordinated with Land Rover and calibrated all my new sensors. Flawless work-and they finished the work before their estimated date. Well ran company... they're professional while maintaining kindness and integrity -highly recommended.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"sales was not good, no follow up, no help, top of the line jeep has many issues and on the whole, felt like they didn't care at all about us, the car or the sale, that was a year ago and it has been that way ever since. if i hadn't been a long time jeep driver, i would have left these folks for almost any other dealership.

don't expect much and you'll be happy."
Automotive,3.5,CG,Took my Jeep Wrangler here for an oil change and they did a great job. I was in and out within an hour and I was out in less than 30 minutes. They were courteous and professional and the price was very reasonable. I would definitely come back to this location for any vehicle maintenance. I have been going to them for years.
Automotive,4.0,CG,"My husband raves about this dealership. The dealership is a joke. We purchased a car from them. We had an excellent experience. The process took about an hour, but it was pretty quick. They had our paperwork ready to go, and it was ready when we arrived. The staff was great. The waiting room was clean and they had free coffee and a coffee machine"
Automotive,1.0,CG,"You think oh, $4/a day, it's free? Not. And, I'm pretty sure that's not the case. And, if you're wondering what kind of oil you're getting, just be careful. I came here for an oil change and tire rotation. I had a coupon and they were super fast and efficient."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Well I'll be!! A Cadillac that has been in the shop for a while now, I'm pretty sure I'll be using them for all my car repairs!I bought a used car from this dealership. I told them I would like to do a car inspection and to check the oil. I had a 2 hour wait time to get in the car."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Friendly staff but everything else was a mess. 

I left my car there and they never returned my call. The front desk person took my car out to the back and it was still there. 

They said they would call me when it was finished. I never received a call. I called three times and they said they would call me back."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Not good. They used substandard oil and the oil change was a waste of my time. Don't go here. 

I will be writing the review on the BBB as well.I had an excellent experience at Precision Toyota. I was greeted with friendly and knowledgeable staff. I had a very pleasant experience. I was in and out in less than an hour"
Automotive,1.5,CG,"lmao the hillbilly of a car dealership, and the folks at Dolan Toyota were amazing! 

I am very happy with my purchase and the car itself, and would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone in the market for a new or used car. I will be back in the future and recommend Dolan Toyota to everyone I know.

Automotive,3.0,CG,When I went to buy a new car the salesman told me it was my fault for not following the instructions. I had to get a manager to get the manager to take a look at the car. When I left the sales manager came out and told me I had to go home and buy the car. I was also told it was my fault for not having the keys to
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Many thanks to Scotty the manager for his professionalism and integrity.

Automotive,3.0,CG,"DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR PHONE AND NO MORE!! 

I left my car there and the guy who worked on it said I needed a new tire, and told me it was going to cost over $500. 00. I said no thanks. I called to check on it and the guy said they could have it done for $250."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"I would never come here! We have been using them for years and they are always very friendly and professional.

This was our first time coming here and we have always had excellent service!They are terrible. I made an appointment for"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"My white car was covered in dirt when I came in for a car wash, these guys made it spick and span.  The car looks brand new, inside and out, the rims are polished to perfection.  All in 30 minutes. On top of it all, everyone that works there is really nice, welcoming, and friendly.  You can also take a nice stroll around Ybor City while it's getting done.  Highly recommended."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Writing this review specifically for Brian who was in the front desk. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get my car checked up since the mechanic wasn't available at that time, but Brian took a lot of his time to educate me on my car. Brian was very welcoming and took his time to patiently address every single concern of mine. If my car ever needs some sort of collision repair, I will be coming here."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I needed air in a tire so I stopped at this gas station on Carrillo and and Bath. The air pump didnt work so I went inside an asked them to turn it on. The guy it is $. 75. I informed hom that it is illegal to charge for air in California. He repeated ""it's seventy five cents ma'am"" I wouldn't give this dirty place my business because of attitude alone."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Do NOT lease a car from Reedmans.  After I returned it, under milage and a month early, they said I did not owe anything. I was slammed with a $450 surprise bill from GM saying it was a dealer fee, for not leasing or purchasing from them. When I asked for my written contract, they sent a hardcopy of what I can only describe as microfilm size writing, I cannot read this at all."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Seehra is my absolute favorite. He will never scam you, he often gives you free things like this engine cleaning chemical or checks your tires/oil, he shows customers pictures of his beautiful family, and he is very affordable. Seehra is incredibly hard working and has built this business completely himself. Sometimes I'm happy when I have car trouble because it means I get to spend an hour with Seehra. I can't recommend this business enough."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"My experience with Kehoe was overwhelmingly negative, so much so that I joined Yelp to write about it. I was overcharged, and the check-out person was incredibly rude. 

In response to the original review, I received an apology and partial refund, which is nice (ignoring the creepiness factor of that). 

I would not go to Kehoe again, even if my car died in front of their lot, but I hope others have a better experience."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Just bought a SUV from Dolan Mazda - Kia and I'm am totally amazed at the service I have received. I highly recommend that if you are looking for a new or used vehicle, start at this place. The sales representatives Bisharat Ali, Mike C, Dave and Alfonso were absolutely helpful and worked with me and my wife to give us the perfect vehicle we wanted. They are also military friendly."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I'm guilty of never taking my car to get washed. Today I treated my car to the $33 car wash package. I was beyond impressed with how well the guys did. My car looks amazing inside and out. I didn't know the inside could look so good! I gave the guys a tip and left very happy. I do wish they had a deal with the gas, but no place is perfect."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My son needed a new transmission and we specifically picked this store because I have AAA and this entitles me to 10 percent off services!
The bill was over $2000 and I was told only $50 would be taken off the bill!

They refused to honor the  AAA discount!  I called 4 other meineke locations and all verified I should have received the discount!!!
Don't trust the manager!  He wouldn't even return my calls!!!

Automotive,4.0,OR,"UPDATE MAY 2019
Last month I went here only for cost comparison after last experience in 2018. I wanted specific tires for our other car, and was strongly urged to buy Big O brand.  I insisted the ones I wanted.  TOO EXPENSIVE.  Later that day, I bought the same exact tires and service at a national competitor for $285 LESS for a set of 4.  I guess no more BOT for me."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I drove almost a week with the TPMS light that came on one day while I was driving. These guys saved by broke college student butt, and discovered that a screw pierced the rear left tire of my brand new Jetta. They also found that apparently, the other 3 tires were OVER-INFLATED from the factory. The best part? They repaired the tire for free. They also did the work in less time than they thought."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Never coming back. They were profesional and polite at first so I didn't mind the way higher than average pricing, but geez Louise when they are done with you they are rude. They didn't do anything to check out the car. They just went by a script.

Save your money AND take your car to a mechanic that will actually treat your car like more than a piggy bank, just another ticket.

What a waste of time!"
Automotive,5.0,CG,Ive purchased tires here and had an amazing experience.  I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change.

Automotive,4.0,CG,The waiting room is 2nd row with free coffee and a TV. There is a TV and a free water. The waiting room is also very clean and clean. I would definitely go back. It's a little pricey for a car wash and car wash. The machine works a bit better than most car washes in the area.
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Always pleased. Friends with a Mercedes Benz and the service department is always friendly and professional. I recommend to anyone looking for a car.I've been using the Tires Plus for years and have never had a complaint.

Automotive,4.0,CG,"Got an oil change, called and asked if they could do it. They said yes and said they would be there the next day. I showed up at 4:30 and was told they couldn't do it. I asked if I could drop off the car and they said no. I asked if they could do it right then."

Doesn't seem to be any honest garages anymore
Automotive,3.5,OR,Called the services dept on a Saturday to have a battery replaced for a car that was still under warranty and was told by service that it would not be covered. I then called dealer where I purchased this vehicle and battery is covered and was more then helpful in replacing the battery for us. Don't rely on flammer ford's service dept to give you the right information about your vehicles warranty. Take your ford's elsewhere.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"My car was broken into and I had to get the window replaced...called the day before, they said they would have the part the next morning. I showed up gave them the keys...took over 3 1/2 hours for them to replace the window that takes less then 20 mins to do. I sat there and watched as people came in and out and got their service done. Never again. Going somewhere else if it happens again."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"They have great service! This isn't a place you ideally want to be because it is a towing company but, my best friends car got towed and they took great care of the vehicle. The property manager arrived 30 minutes early for our appointment. (Make sure to book an appointment) and they even covered the sun roof because it was open at the time of towing. Really overall great! Speedy process of getting you vehicle back."
Automotive,2.0,OR,Had a bad experience here with break pad replacements. Something broke as they were replacing them so that was an additional expense I had to pay for and caused for my car to have to stay overnight. Then the break pads were still making noise so I took it back and they just said it was dirty. Unprofessional staff. I do not plan to return. This happened a while ago so they may be better now.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I was very pleased with my buying experience.  Both Willemina and Jeremiah were very friendly and eager to assist in answering my questions.  I have taken my new Azera back to have the interior and exterior treated with a protectant against spills, tree sap, etc.  The service was done quickly and professionally and the staff was once again friendly.  I will continue to use this dealership for my regular maintenance and repairs."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I went in for a routine tire service. The appointment was scheduled and confirmed by the dealer only to show up and hear that the mechanic that does this service is only around during the mornings and that because it was the busy season, there wouldn't be any openings for an entire week. 

I don't understand the reasoning behind allowing an appointment to be scheduled even when there is no intention of a service being provided."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I have been using them for new tires and tire repairs since they opened at their present location.  They have never failed to do first rate work,  quickly as promised, and do everything in a cheerful and friendly manner.  Their pricing is reasonable.  You always have the feeling that you were treated fairly, and that you are valued as a customer.  This is no hassle, no nonsense service at its best."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I rented a car last week and just received an obnoxiously rude phone call about some alleged damages on the car. None were pointed out to me when the car was brought back. The individual on the phone was screaming at me. Absolutely would not recommend. I was willing to overlook the unfriendly clerks when i picked up the car, but this incident is above and beyond an extremely unpleasant customer experience. Plenty of other choices."
Automotive,1.5,OR,I came here to get accessories installed after purchasing a new car and couldn't have had a worse experience. I was mislead from the start with how long it would take and the service associate was completely indifferent to my time. They were extremely disorganized and did not try to hide the fact that they didn't care one bit. I will never be coming back here and advise any potential customer to look elsewhere for service.
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Was ok service, charged 14. 95 and the oil change was free. When I got home the check engine light was on and I was told that the light was not on.

Automotive,5.0,CG,This was a great experience. We will be back!I've been going to this car wash for years.  Every time I've been there they have been extremely friendly and helpful.

Automotive,3.5,OR,This place is the best! Confidently located and extremely efficient. Prices are fair and the people who work there will make you feel like your at home while you wait for your car. They noticed I was a nurse and gave me a really fair discount on my car because they noticed and made me feel extremely comfortable. Go here for all of your car needs and stop by a local business for dinner on the hill!
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I originally took my vehicle to Grays Auto Service because it was within walking distance to my house. I discovered the staff there are knowledgeable and take the time to explain issues without using confusing jargon. They are honest and did not pressure me into paying for additional services, and talked through the pros/cons and logic behind future services. Services were also performed in a timely manner. I would highly recommend them to anyone in the neighborhood!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"After being told at the concessionary that it would cost about $300 and take a few hours to replace the battery on my car, I decided to stop by this AutoZone to see if I could get it done at a lower price.

From my personal customer service experience here I was very satisfied! One of their employees, Danny, was super nice and helpful and he got my old battery replaced within 15 minutes for half the price!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I was caught in the middle of a 4 car fender bender, had front and rear damage (4K).  From start to finish Caliber Collision in Maple Shade was perfect.  Very professional and the Customer Service was outstanding.  My Rep was Carmine...he kept me informed every couple days.  It took 15 minutes when I dropped it off and 15 when I picked it up.  Fixed perfectly and guaranteed for like....can't ask fo more."
Automotive,3.5,OR,Wanna give a special shout out to Jared who took extra time with us on the phone when we called to ask a basic question about a problem we encountered in our car while driving. He told us to come pop by and he'd check it out and within a minute or two he checked the car and assured us we are all good to go and we were on our way. THANKS JARED YOURE THE MAN!
Automotive,2.5,OR,"If I could give them zero stars I would! They did a  half ass job, I was guaranteed that my rims were supposed to get waxed but they are still dirty! Plus my dashboard and middle console still had spots and dirt marks which they couldve removed and I asked twice to do but they just acted like they didnt care! It was just a waste of money in general! I don't recommend them at all!!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I received a message from Martina, a friendly employee at the Convention Center Parking Facility a while back. She was nice enough to offer me a day of free parking because of the mistake surrounding my first visit there. I wound up returning over the weekend and everything went well. The chipped yellow paint is thankfully all gone, the garage is in tip-top shape, and it's an easy walk to the Convention Center right across the street."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I can't say enough good things about my experience at Serra and with Mark ""Irish"" and the entire team that helped me. Buying a car is probably in my top 10 scariest things to do, but Mark was patient, kind and just completely transparent during the entire process. I never once felt pressured to buy nor like my questions were silly. He made the entire process easy and I'd recommend him and the dealership to anyone looking."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I grew up here in Goleta, but have since moved away for business for the past two years. When I came back for vacation and my '05 STi decided to throw a fit, I knew this was the only local shop that I could trust. 

Ryan and Nolan got the car sorted out, and even gave me some insight about it that I didn't know of. Prices are extremely reasonable, and they're great people to talk to."
Automotive,3.5,OR,My car needed to be towed so I called AAA and they sent out one of these guys. They made it to me in less than 10 minutes and the gentleman was quick and efficient. I only wish I had more cash for his tip. $5 was definitely not enough for the great service I received. So to try and make up for that I decided to take the time to give him a yelp.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Wow, not what I expect in terms of service and quality. I don't have a crazy, fancy car, it's a BMW 325 and can't tell you how disappointed I was in lack of responsiveness from the company. After speaking with the owner, I brought it in and the work done was really poor. So many details missed from dust on all the air vents, to fingerprints on rear windows to the passenger side mat not being vacuumed."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I love this place. I've been here multiple times and every time I come, the staff are super friendly. While they advise me on what my car needs or could use, I don't feel pressured like I have at other places. I only had to wait one time, otherwise they've been able to take me right away. It is a little bit on the pricey side, but I will still come here for the service I get."
Automotive,2.0,CG,Over priced and every car that I've ever owned. I will never ever go back to them.I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Elantra from Autonation Hyundai in November 2016. The buying experience was fantastic. I was able to make an appointment for the following week for the following week. I was able to book an appointment online and made an appointment for the following week.
Automotive,5.0,CG,"If you are in the market for a car, try out Dolan Toyota. I was just looking for a used car and I found one that I liked. I had a very good experience with Dolan Toyota and will be a loyal customer. If you are looking for a new car, go to Dolan Toyota. I did not feel pressured to buy something I didn't really need."
Automotive,3.5,CG,I brought my Toyota Corolla here for the first time in two years. The first time was just an oil change. The second time was to get the tires rotated. The first time was to have my car inspected. I was told it would take about an hour. I arrived at my appointment and was told the oil change would take about an hour.
Automotive,4.5,CG,"The guys at frost RV are always professional and very friendly.  

The only thing I can say about the RV I purchased is that they have a great selection of 4 new RV's.  

They have a very nice waiting area with a TV and a lot of people to work on their phones.  They have a great selection of several different RV's. "
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Our starter died while we were on the road. We called AAA and they said the starter would be $100.  The guy said they would get the part, but it was going to cost over $500.   We called AAA and told them what happened.  The guy said they would get the part, and it would be about $100.  So we waited another hour"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Seeger Toyota was great about keeping me updated with the progress of my car, and I was given a free oil change. The waiting room is also very comfortable and clean. The sales manager was very nice and personable. I'm a loyal Toyota customer for life. I would definitely recommend going to a Toyota dealer for your next vehicle.I had a very good experience at this dealership."
Automotive,2.0,CG,Worst experience of my life. We bought a car and they sold it back to us. We were told that we had to pay for a rental car and the car was not worth it. We had to take it to a different dealership to get it fixed. This is the worst experience we have had. Do not go to this place.I had a very good experience at this dealership
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Rather new to the area. 

I'd give them a five star rating if I could.I had an excellent experience at Chapman.  My car was returned to me in a timely manner and was detailed.  The staff was extremely courteous and professional.  The staff also provided a loaner car while I was waiting.  I will definitely use Chapman again!I"
Automotive,4.0,CG,I had never gotten an oil change at the dealership. I came back for a full synthetic oil change and an oil change and I was out within 45 minutes. This place is very clean and it's well stocked. I will definitely be back.I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I had a nail in my tire and they took care of it.
Automotive,2.5,CG,I am beyond grateful for the excellent service and the quality of work. Thank you!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change. The gentleman behind the counter was very rude and condescending. It was clear I was being taken advantage of and charged for something I never asked for. I ended up going to a different place to get a second opinion.
Automotive,3.0,CG,This center has become the go to for all my car repairs. The guys here are knowledgeable and have the best prices in town. The staff is friendly and always willing to work with you. They have a coffee shop for all your car needs. The staff also offers a shuttle service for your car. I highly recommend this place. I will be back.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I have brought all my cars here for services. Over the years I did the regular inspections there. Sean is an incredible mechanic. Unlike other places he is not looking for ""problems "" that need an expensive solution. He just does a great job. The times when I actually needed work, alignment, brakes etc. he was thorough, efficient, and most importantly honest in his recommendations. I truly feel comfortable when he is working on my car. Highly recommended."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Beware single women! These guys will take total advantage of you. I had my car towed down there because the oil light was coming on intermittently. Over a week and $2788 later, my oil light still comes on and they want me to put it back in the shop. They may or may not honor the warranty from my $2788 investment depending on what they find? After rental car charges and taxis, I spent well over $3000. I. DO. NOT. RECOMMEND. THIS. REPAIR. SHOP. TO."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Took my 350z Here and will never be back!!! Expensive, scam artists. If my car broke down right in front of their shop I would still not come here. Went down the street and got my car fixed for Over $700 cheaper WITH OEM parts. Ayers couldn't even come close with cheap Japanese parts if I brought them in myself. I love the rebuttal from the management, there's a reason your shop barely has 3 stars on yelp."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I went for genuine Volvo parts and ended up visiting both Volvo and VW showrooms. 
They found me the part and and programmed the key to work with my cat. Priced right with friendly knowledgeable service.
The showrooms featured a selection of beautiful Volvos and a very welcoming feel, comfortable to look around and ask questions from professional salespeople.
The VW showroom, on the same property, had the same atmosphere and a fewgreat VDubs.
Next vehicle will be a Wynn Volvo."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"The good reviews I've seen here encouraged me to try them for my next oil change. Made appointment in advance, and was told the oil change and courtesy check would take one hour. I received a call 20 minutes later advising me my car was ready for pickup. That's SERVICE!
Friendly staff, clean store and professionally run. 
It's near impossible to find a place that caters to the customer in this particular line of business.
Needless to say, I'm grateful!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"The BEST!!! 

Alex, Nick and the gang are amazing! If you need tire, service, or both on your vehicle this is where you need to go! I've relied on them countless times, and they've always come through with great customer service, with fair prices!! 

Do yourself favor and get there when you need to! You won't regret it!

Thanks for always looking out for me guys!! It's been more than 10 years and I'm still a very satisfied customer!!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"We had a great experience here. The gentleman who helped us was named Steven. I will NEVER have to deal with disgusting car salesman again and I am so excited about that. There was no pressure, Steven had answers for the questions we had, and the car lot was set up easily so we didn't have to dig through to find the cars in our price range. I'll never buy a car from any other place but CarMax."
Automotive,4.5,OR,After finally registering my car to pa I needed to get it inspected and 1st rate auto was a yelp recommendation. They did not disappoint. They were quick and were transparent about costs. I had to have some brake work done to pass inspection and they finished the work later that day. I hadn't made an appointment. Just drove right in.  They also will apparently text me in a year when I am due again for inspection.
Automotive,5.0,OR,Fast and professional service at a very reasonable price. I went there for tires today that I pre ordered using their webshop. Shortly after ordering we scheduled the service appointment. Took them less than an hour to change all four of them. The whole process was seamless and professional. I chose these guys over Costco and given the experience and the range of tire brands (unlike Costco) I will be back if any of our vehicles need tires.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Thanks to Atlas Towing for their help. I locked myself out of my car, and called my car insurance company for roadside assistance. They sent Atlas Towing to unlock my car for me. Jerry was super nice and helpful, and took care of it in a second. His truck was marked with Atlas Towing, and I saw him right away as soon as he can. Thanks Jerry for taking care of me with a smile on your face."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Rude customer service and bad car wash! Don't waste ur money! Car is still dirty inside and seeing as this was the first time there I had no idea of there process, guys who started car didn't give me a ticket. The guy at the front was rude because I didn't have a ticket. All of this I could have over looked had the car been clean. However, it's nothing more than a crappy wipe down and vacuum."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"I loved my experience with this dealership and the experience was good. 

The first couple of months ago I had a bad experience with the dealership, and I had a very good experience with the sales person. 

I came in for an oil change and was given a coupon for a free oil change. I was also told the car was on the rack and I could bring it"
Automotive,3.0,CG,They are AWFUL!!! I came here to get an oil change and they told me my car needed synthetic oil. I told them I don't want to get the synthetic oil. They were so nice and honest. They told me I needed a new engine. I brought my car back and they said they would put it in the wrong place and I had to wait another hour for them to take
Automotive,5.0,CG,"Seriously THE only place I go to get my oil changed.

And, I'm pretty sure that's not the case.

And, if you're in a hurry, this place is awesome. It's a little pricey, but it's worth it.The staff was friendly and helpful. I was in and out in under an hour and they even gave me a ride home while"
Automotive,1.5,CG,Save your money and do not go here.Went in to get my tire patched and the guy who helped me had a bad attitude. He then said he didn't have time to look at it and told me to come back in. He told me he didn't have time for me and it would be a few minutes. I waited another 10 minutes and I was back on the road.
Automotive,4.0,CG,Had my SUV painted at this place and they did an amazing job. My car looks like new. They are super friendly and I will definitely be back!I bought a used car from this dealership and had no issues.  I was told it was going to be a two hour wait.  They said it was a 2 hour wait.  I made an appointment for the following Tuesday. 
Automotive,3.0,CG,"It took a little bit longer than expected but the folks here were very kind and helpful.  They did an awesome job and I will definitely be back!I bought a car from this dealership.

I trust them with all my cars and I will continue to bring all"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Hands down easiest buying process ever. The dealership is a class act. If you are looking for a new vehicle, this is the place. 

I worked with a sales manager that I worked with in the past. I was very pleased with the service and the price. The entire experience was fast and easy. I did not feel pressured to buy a car. I also got a"
Automotive,4.0,CG,Stopped in on a Friday afternoon to get an oil change.  The guy who helped me said he would be right with me.  I told him I was there to get my oil changed.  He told me to come in at 8:30.  At 8:00 I was there.  I was there at 9:00 and he said it would be an hour. 
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Highly recommended!

As a first time customer, I was very pleased with the workmanship and the customer service.

I had a bad experience with the dealer, and I'm sure it's because of the fact that the dealer is a small bit far from my house, so I had to wait a bit to get my car to be fixed.  However, they did a"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"This place doesn't look like a real garage. I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation. The guy behind the counter said the tires were fine, and it was ready to go in about 15 minutes. The manager even told me to come back in for the rotation. I was really impressed with the level of service and customer care I received."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Just wanted to say that this place is the best in the area. I have been coming here for a year now and I am always impressed with the work and customer service. I would definitely go back. 

Thank youI came here for an oil change and tire rotation. I had a tire emergency with a nail in it. They got me in right away and had me out within"
Automotive,3.0,CG,Alright id like to go here cause I am very picky about cars and have a lot of time.  I had a friend look at the vehicle and we told him about it and he said it was still in good shape.  I had told him I was interested in getting the vehicle and he said he was going to go get the keys to the vehicle to see if I could get it
Automotive,4.0,CG,This is the only place that has the quality of work I need. The guys here are knowledgeable and have the best prices in town. The work is done in a timely manner and it's a great value. I will be coming back when I need work done on my vehicle. I had a great experience purchasing a car from here and it was a smooth transaction.
Automotive,2.0,CG,Costco could not help me. The dealership has no idea how to turn a situation into a nightmare. I had to get a tow and then the car died on me. The dealership was extremely rude and did not help me. I would not recommend this dealership. I had a 2 day rental car and it took them 2 hours to tow my car.
Automotive,3.5,OR,I worked with Tim Schuhardt to purchase my car and Tim Wagner to finance. Both were VERY professional. It was a whole different experience buying a car at Jack Schmitt. I'd could best describe it as fairly effortless and completely unlike other dealerships I purchased from in the past. The vehicle I wanted was price competitively and I was given a reasonable price for my trade in. I'll definitely be back to purchase another car from Jack Schmitt Chevrolet.
Automotive,2.0,OR,My husband and I had a 30 minute phonecall conversation about picking up my vehicle but were very surprised to find out only upon our arrival that our vehicle was no longer there. The guy we spoke to didn't even bother to look up our vehicle profile throughout our conversation and was such a prick once we got there. Terrible terrible company. I would never use them. The fact that they're even still operating is a miracle to me.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"We're traveling in our RV from Seattle for the weekend and our AC wouldn't take a charge. We read the reviews and after calling 2 other shops this was the first to answer the phone in person. The owner got us in the same day, fixed our AC for under $100 and we are back on the road in comfort! The reviews are cirrect. These are good people and charge reasonable rates. Wish we had the same back home!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Jim @JG is awesome. We knew the transmission on my pickup was going. He fervently tried to keep it going before the inevitable blow-up. 

Well, the trans rebuild has been solid. It will never blow up again thanks to an external trans cooler. You get what you pay for. This thing has been dynamite, maybe 5 years now. 

He has also serviced my transfer case, U-joints, and hubs. He will not do unnecessary repairs. I highly recommend his shoppe."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"5 different price settings depending on what you would like done. 
Small inside with a TV and soda machine, some magazines. Some outdoor seats as well. 
The guy was nice enough to expect to probably be about an hour wait... it ended up being about 1.5 hours, and it was a Monday afternoon. 
For a $34 wash, it's pretty good. Inside and outside looked clean and tires were shiny. 
The business explains that for the price, it's good work."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"So we're from out of town, and had an issue with the electronics on my 2018 Chev HD2500 Silverado. Got a recommendation from Auto Zone. Called got Gabe on the phone. Told us to come over 10 minutes from where we were. In and out in one hour 30 minutes from arrival to fully satisfied.  Every staff members were all friendly. SAMMY the pet English Bull dog puppty entertained us. Fair price great service. 5 stars. Highly recommend."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I needed to get brakes and called last minute because I was free unexpectedly.  They told me what time to come and took me in as soon as I got there.  They couldn't have been nicer, explained the costs right away with a more economical option and explained why the most economical option might not be the best.  They never tried to upsell or claim I needed anything that I didn't and got me out promptly."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I came in for just a simple oil change, but of course they found $1500 worth of problems with my car. I had to tell them at least three times that I wanted to wait on doing the repairs so I could do some research. They just wanted to take advantage of a young woman by saying I could only get a deal on the repairs that day. I know a good Midas shop and this is not one."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This place will forever be my go-to for any of my car needs. The staff is friendly, patient, honest, & understanding. They always get back to you plus the pricing is fair. If you need any work on your car or just need a steady place to go to for all your car needs, this is the place. ZERO stress. I'm always skeptical when reading reviews, but this place did not disappoint. Def stop by and check them out!!"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"I just got charged $161 to run a diagnostic on an airbag light. Don't go here. Ever. 

In fact I've been here numerous times over the past 8 years but this is my first review. I've ALWAYS had a horrible experience. They will up sell you on everything 'wrong with car' and if you let them actually work on your car it will take them forever. I'm selling my Subaru and not looking back. 

This place is a joke."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Great place to buy, but service dept is slow and unreliable. Had to take my car in twice for something simple, then they never called to tell me they were done. I had tried to reach them a few times and there was no answer. Never wait, you will be there for a looooong time. Chapman is bad too, we just don't have good service in town unless you go to European auto but then maintenance won't be covered."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I purchased the ""Gold"" package with a $3.00 off coupon, bringing the total to $14.97. The automated wheel cleaner did such a poor job, they look worse now. Very sloppy dashboard cleaning and terrible vacuuming of the interior. The cargo area behind the rear seat wasn't  even touched. I really don't think there is a perfect car wash, you have to find the best of the worst but in my opinion, this place didn't even make that list."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I just brought my newly purchased used Mercedes into Costa's for the first time. I wanted them to check it over and give me an assessment. I have to say that they are  professional & honest and do great work. They didn't try to up-sell me on unnecessary service, and now I can be confident that my car is in perfect working order! I see why they are busy all of the time."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"These guys really went above and beyond to meet our expectations! The way they took ownership of our situation, remedied the problem with an end result that was extremely fair and generous really speaks volumes about their character and values! Roger and his team are courteous and take the time to explain things  thoroughly and precisely.We just moved to Tucson and are so very happy to have found such a great auto shop around the corner! Thanks Guys!!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Needed a smog test to renew registration now the we live in Reno. Rob was awesome!  Fast and efficient. He event told us we could renew the registration right here. Wowza. He saved me a trip to the DMV. Rob even waived the $10 fee to register on site! All took about 15 minutes! Thanks Rob for being super awesome! Oh and to top it off, he even gave us a free car wash! High fives to Rob!!!!"
Automotive,2.5,CG,The Jeep selection (and the vehicle) was the best experience I have ever had buying a vehicle. The salesperson was very knowledgeable and patient. He made the purchase a positive experience. The salesperson was extremely personable and helpful. The sales associate (who is still in business) also helped me to get my current Jeep and I feel very comfortable and comfortable with the purchase.
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Again. Such nice, honest folks. We will be back!I've been going to this car wash for years.  Every time I've been there they have been extremely friendly and helpful.  The only thing I can say about this place is they have some special special car washes which are also great.  I have also gotten the Ultimate package which is the best I've found. "
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I am a loyal customer and will continue to purchase and service my car at this dealership. 

Thank you, Nick. You guys are the best!I had a very good experience with this shop.  I dropped my car off around 9:30am to get an oil change and a tire rotation.  I was in and out in less than an hour.  They were very polite"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"I've been intending to share this with people. 

I've had my car serviced twice here and both times it's been done with the same service, but it's not that it's convenient to drive in and out of the shop. 

The waiting room is also clean and comfortable.

I've also had the same issue with my car that I've been having"
Automotive,1.5,CG,"UPDATE - after speaking with the owner, the owner and the manager, they were very apologetic. I had a bad experience with the dealership, and I'm sure it's because of the fact that the sales manager, Dan, is the only reason why I am giving them 5 stars. Dan was also the most professional, and helpful person I have ever encountered."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Safelite was quick and efficient. The guys were friendly and professional. They got me in and out within an hour and I was out in less than 30 minutes. I will definitely go back. Thanks guys!  You guys are awesome!I had a great experience at this location. I was helped by Andrew, who was great and very knowledgeable."
Automotive,2.5,CG,In 2009 I was pressured into a car with a warranty that I did not have. I purchased the car from them and it was a great experience. The car was in great shape and was ready to go in no time. I would highly recommend them. I will be back.I would give a zero if I could.  I went in to get a simple tire repair and they told me my
Automotive,3.0,CG,"They have the worst customer service. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the shuttle is so long. The driver was nice and polite, but the driver was very rude.The customer service is great.  I've been coming here for years and I've never had a problem.  They have a great selection of cars and have never tried to sell me anything I didn't need"
Automotive,3.0,CG,I came here to get my oil changed and they told me it would take 2 hours.  When I got there the guy I talked to told me that he didn't have time to work on it and it would be a 2 hour wait.  I was told that they would have the car ready by the end of the day.  At 3:30 I received a call from the next day
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Not good. a bit disorganized on the outside, but the inside was clean. There were a few spots on the interior that were missed but not worth the extra money. Overall a great experience and would go back. Thank youI came here for an oil change and tire rotation. I had a tire emergency and I was told it would take about an hour to complete."
Automotive,2.5,CG,I brought my suburban in for an oil change and they did a great job. I was in and out within an hour and I was out in less than 30 minutes. They were courteous and professional and I will be back for future car services. I will recommend them to everyone I know. I had a great experience purchasing a car from here. They were very accommodating and accommodating.
Automotive,4.5,CG,"I  have been entrusting this dealership for years and they continue to keep my cars in top shape.

I had a great experience with the dealership, and the sales manager, Chris, was very professional and helpful in explaining every feature of the car. I highly recommend you check out the vehicle online before you purchase. I did also have a great experience with the finance manager, Chris."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"The shuttle service for Parking Spot has been great.  I will return for my next trip.Great customer service.  The driver, Steve, is the best.  He is courteous and professional.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"This one is horrible. Store manager has zero customer service skills.

If you want to go to a place that is open on a Saturday and then have to wait on a long line to get your car washed, this is your place.I wish I could give this place no stars.  They quoted me a price and when I went to pick up my car the sales person said it was"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Nothing can rival the customer service experience or competitive pricing that is offered by Dobbs Tire and Auto Center in Collinsville.  They have a wonderful, friendly staff and superb management.  If you have any auto service need whether it be a routine oil change or something major make sure that Dobbs in Collinsville is your first stop and you will not be disappointed!  Just ask for Mike the service manager and he will take care of you!!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,Guy in the office was beyond rude. Worst customer service ever. We had to be dropped off outside the parking lot because it was way over capacity. After a 4 hour flight with delays we're dragging our luggage around. Only redeeming thing was how nice the van driver was. Helped us get our 3/4 ton truck out of a way over full parking lot. Will go back to the Hilton for our parking needs. Wish I had checked yelp first.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I've used AutoTire a few times; break, tires and oil changes. Yesterday I had to take my car in for an oil change and tire rotation. Not only is the staff wonderful to work with but they will alert me to any potential problems ahead of time and no changes unless I approve.  Yesterday I received exceptional service and on a holiday weekend. I will continue to use this repair for my car and will refer anyone to them!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,this dealership does not do what it says very unprofessional management they practice giving out a lot of excuses. the manager is michael loff and sales person armen difilppo. the car we purchased is great but lies and deceitfulness is not good business practice i wont divulge exactly what happened per se but again car is great the staff on a scale of 1 to10 is a (2). if i could give no stars i would but not an option.
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I found the passenger window of my Volkswagen Jetta broken early this week. After arriving at my office I called this company. I was immediately able to fix an appointment for the same afternoon. I took 30-45 min for the person to replace it without any problem. I paid very easily by debit card. Moreover, I have been told that I have a life-time warranty on the window.

In conclusion: very good service at an excellent price. I recommend without hesitation!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I can't thank D'Avico's enough! They truly go above and beyond for their customers. Over the years, I have had everything from a basic oil change, brake change, inspection, nitrogen transfer in my tires and even a tiny paint touch up!

D'Avico's makes my life so much easier-they even provided me with a rental car when I didn't have time to wait for an oil change!!! I seriously don't know any other auto mechanic that would do that....

5 stars for D'Avico's!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,Great service the guys behind the counter actually listen to what you're saying. Quick service they are not like discount tire or tire barn ..in and out in less than an hour on a new set of tires rotated and balanced. Tire barn discount tire actually have very bad customer service. I could write a book on last experience I had with tire barn never go back I'm glad I sold the truck that had the warranty on the tires
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Don't go for services. I will never go there. My car has some minor dents, first pic. After repair, it becomes more serious. The paint got cracked after repair, second pic, and a minor problem becomes a serious problem now costing thousands of dollars for further repair.

The service people there tell lies, bad service and back work. If you don't take pictures and don't talk with them through emails, every price will increase. I experienced this. Luckily I took pictures."
Automotive,2.0,OR,I recommend the auto body department of Fiat of Maple Shade. My Jeep Cherokee got a scratch on the door from another car. The paint department and manager quickly assessed the problem and recommended just trying touch up paint before automatically jumping into an expensive full door paint job that other locations insisted on (up to $750). I appreciate their offer to try cost effective options first in a very friendly manner. They even did it right on the spot!
Automotive,1.5,OR,"The only place I will park for work. Some of the guys have been working there for the full two years that I've been parking there and are the nicest guys. One day I parked my car there when it had been making a weird noise and the attendant took the time to look at it and tell me what was wrong, which I totally appreciated it! Great staff and cheaper than across the street! Don't forget to tip y'all!!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,I have used Pasadena Car Care for about 6 years on various cars. I haven't found anything they cant do yet and they have got to be the most personable happy bunch of mechanics I have ever seen. I feel like they are always honest with me and the quality of work they do is top notch. They are always flexible with working you into what always looks like very busy days for them.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Very professional group of hard working guys here.  I had to wait 3.5 hours for a single tire to be put on but was I mad? No.  I received great customer service from these guys and they were completely swamped. A few old women came in and berated them for not moving them up in order. Of course, this wasn't possible. These poor young guys took it in stride and soldiered on. I wish I had that composure."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Working with Jeff has been a real pleasure, he took his time to show me lots of options, never pressured me to buy, I ended up buying tires, rims and a leveling kit as well. 
And when we had the wrong wheels on my truck, he was able to find an immediate solution and was super courteous the entire time. In this day and age, customer service is becoming none existent, my hat goes off to Jeff and Embassy tires!"
Automotive,1.0,OR,"I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars. The owner (Kevin Brannigan) is an unprofessional pig who cat calls young girls in the street. It's no coincidence his shop's initials are KKK, he is so rude and blatantly racist my next call is the the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint. Unprofessional attitudes and low quality work mean I'm taking my car elsewhere. He ought to be ashamed of himself, and close this den of hate permanently."
Automotive,4.0,CG,I called around Santa Barbara and found the dealership to be very professional and helpful. I was greeted by a very friendly salesperson. He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and was very patient with me. I told him I would be back for a car. I was very happy with the vehicle and felt comfortable driving it. I did not feel pressured to buy something I didn't really need.
Automotive,2.5,CG,Worked with Jonathan. He was very professional and very knowledgeable. The whole experience was a pleasure. The sales team was also very knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone in the market for a new car. Great experience with Jonathan. I will definitely be back. I had a very good experience at this dealership.
Automotive,3.5,CG,Accurate automotive is a place that takes the time to explain what needs to be done to your vehicle. They are not the cheapest but they are the most honest and honest mechanic you can find. I have had my car in twice now and they have been great with me. They also have a great waiting room and have a comfortable waiting room with free coffee and a coffee machine. I highly recommend them.
Automotive,3.0,CG,I was contacted to address this issue and was informed that I needed to make a reservation to have the vehicle repaired.  The vehicle was not repaired and the car was not repaired.  The dealership was told that the vehicle was in perfect condition and would be ready for pick-up.  I was told that they were going to have to order the part and I would have to come in for a rental
Automotive,3.0,CG,"After my previous review, I had an amazing experience at this dealership. 

The first time I visited, I had a bad experience.  My car was not in great shape and I had to take it in to have it repaired.  I had a car that was not drivable and a 2 year old car that was also in great shape.  I was so impressed with the level of"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"We tend to hit Costco, but I thought it was worth it. The staff here is very friendly and the prices are reasonable. The staff is always courteous and helpful. I have been in twice in a row and each time I've had a good experience. They always try to get me in and out quickly. They also offer a lifetime warranty."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Just an update to my review. The dealership has yet to receive a call back. I just wanted to make sure the car I purchased was in excellent condition and the sales manager, Chris, assured me that his team will be in touch with me. This was 4 weeks ago and I still haven't received a call back. I will tell you how much it is to make sure the car is in great"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"I purchased 4 new tires here. The guys were friendly and professional. They were very accommodating and accommodating. The only thing I didn't like about the place was the price. I was expecting to pay a little more for the work, but it was worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to others.The worst!  I went in to get a simple tire fix and they told me my tire"
Automotive,3.0,CG,Thank you Ryan W. for being so professional and knowledgeable. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change.  The gentleman behind the counter was very rude and condescending.  It was clear I was being a customer. I will never go back.I had a great experience with this dealership. I went in to look at a few cars and was told by my
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Accomodating, but I have found that the service department is a class act.

The first time I went in for a simple oil change, they said the car was in great shape and that it needed a little work.  I was told it would take about an hour.  I said no problem.  They came back and said I had to wait on the car to be fixed"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Toyota of Tampa Bay was the closest and the service was good. The only downfall is that the service department is very busy. The staff is not friendly at all and they don't take appointments. The waiting room is a mess. The only reason I give 5 stars is because the service department is pretty decent. However, it is a little overpriced."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"We just leased our 4th Mercedes from them. We worked with a salesperson, Chris, and we were treated fairly. The salesperson was very knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to work with. We worked with Jason, who was very knowledgeable about the vehicles and the features. He knew what we were looking for, and did not push us to buy something we didn't really need."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Long waits despite appointments. We have had our oil changed here twice now and each time we have been pleased with the service. The guys are polite, knowledgeable, and take care of our cars. We have a loyal customer for life and will continue to bring our cars here. They have a great customer service line and have made it easy to schedule an appointment."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"So very disappointed.. took my car for a full services detail and all was well. Then after the sun went down I notice my driver window is clearly scratched and this is a brand new car, they use the vacuum hose on very sensitive areas like dash and instrument door panels so this is very upsetting and I how they repair.  Car wash and cleaning was fine, but they are rushing and sloppy and careless just look at my window."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Just bought 4 new tires from Mr. Hubcap.

They matched Tire Rack's price and offer free tire rotation for the life of the tire. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even printed out the mail-in rebate for the tires. I expected to do it myself online. Now I don't have to.

It only cost $15/tire to install plus $8/tire for disposal and other misc charges. Fair price. Especially compared to Big O prices.  

I would never buy tires anywhere else again."
Automotive,2.0,OR,I had the worst customer service here. I would contact my sales rep and never get a response and this happened multiple times. Bryan the sales manager in charge was too busy joking around with everyone in the room. He was too busy to get back with me on the negotiation. Bottom line is this is the worst customer service you will get ignored and not treated like any customer should. I would not recommend anyone to shop at Ray Brandt!
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I brought my RAV4 to Caliber Collision after an awful hit and run accident on the freeway. I was already upset by the incident, but Caliber made the repair experience so easy. They updated me throughout the whole repair process on the progress of my car - I love the text messaging system! SO convenient! Overall, going to a body shop can be stressful, but not this one. I am really happy with my experience at Caliber Collision."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I really couldn't have asked for a better experience at this Jiffy Lube location. As soon as I pulled in, a super polite employee opened my door for me and explained what I should do next. Then he opened every other door for me and kindly showed me to the waiting room.

They had my oil changed and tires rotated and had my check out finished in LESS THAN 20 minutes. No kidding.

Best oil change experience ever.

Thanks, Jiffy Lube on Rangeline Road!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Don't waste your time with this tire store. I've been a loyal customer buying my tires here. I just went in for a Straight switch and they told me it was going to be a few hours. I called yesterday and they said show up at 8 AM and it will be a quick turnaround. I showed up half an hour early, waited until 8, to be told this. They were so rude with terrible customer service. Find another tire shop."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Shopping for a car can be such a chore and usually takes hours and lots of aggravation. My experience at Parks Ford with my salesman Jack Dietsch was entirely the opposite!  They had exactly the car I wanted and we were able to agree very quickly on price. He was very knowledgeable and very friendly, and the process was much faster than any other car purchase I've made. I was very happy and am so pleased with my new car!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This is the second time, unfortunately, that I needed auto glass repair. Both interactions I have had with this company have been outstanding. I will always, 100%, recommend Wisecrack Auto Glass. Yesterday my back passenger window was busted out. I called after hours thinking I would get an answering machine, but to my amazing surprise I didn't. I told him what happened and he came out and fixed it today, less than 24 hrs later. Thank you for your great work!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,Such fast and friendly service! I made an appointment and came in and was greeted warmly. Troy was my agent. He was very patient with me and considerate of my requests. I really felt comfortable being able to put my needs in his hands. All of the staff was very friendly. I was in and out with my new Vw Jetta with in 3-4 hours. I am very happy about my purchase with out haggle or trouble. I highly recommend Carmax!
Automotive,4.5,OR,I was towed to HiTech auto repair because my battery was dead. It was after hours and Alfred was still there. He is the new owner of HiTec! He also owns VIP Collision Center. What a nice guy! Charged my battery sent me on my way and didn't charge me. If I do ever need work done on my car I will be going to VIP Collision or HiTech. I've read review on VIP and it sounds like he's the best.
Automotive,4.5,OR,Nazar & Micelle are the best ! They are more than a car dealer to me. Everyone in my family buy cars from Nazar. I can say we purchased of twenty cars from Nazar. No dealer can beat his prices. The car buying process can be stressful and difficult however;  buying a car at Nazar is not stressful or difficult. They do all the work for you! If you want a great car and great buying experience go to Nazar!
Automotive,4.5,OR,"If I could I would give you zero stars. I came there today to get a new tire. I spoke with three people and gave them all specific instructions seeing as though I wouldn't be there until after close. Unfortunately they did not listen and now I cannot get my car forcing me to rent one for the weekend! Wow really, I will go back to discount tire. I have never had this happen. You have my money and my car."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I've been to a dozen in and out car wash services and Star Brite makes it easy to swing by for a quick convenient wash when I'm home for the summer. If you want to take them up on their extra care detail it's worth the time. I just stick with the membership since Im only back east 3 months out of the year. Thank you to the friendly staff over there as well. 

PS Year memberships are great stocking stuffers;)"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Broke down 30 miles outside of the city. 

I called my insurance company and they gave me an estimate. The driver, Steve, said the car was in great shape and that it was ready to pick up. I was very pleased. I was very impressed.

They were extremely fast and very friendly. I will definitely use them again. I will definitely use them again for my next"
Automotive,5.0,CG,Lonnie arrived promptly as scheduled and helped me with the repair. The estimate was very reasonable and the work was done in a timely manner. The work was completed in a timely manner. I would highly recommend them. Great work!I was looking to purchase a new vehicle and I had a very positive experience at this dealership.
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Shane at Action Tire is the best and the best. He is honest, fair, and he doesn't try to sell you anything you don't need. He has a great attitude and he takes the time to explain what is wrong with your car. I really appreciate his honesty and honesty. I would recommend this shop to anyone who wants a great car and great customer service.I took my car here for"
Automotive,2.0,CG,I have a C300 that I have been using for a few years now and have been very happy with the service.  The people are always friendly and the service is always great.  The waiting room is comfortable and clean.  The coffee is good as well.  If you have a vehicle that needs service or maintenance I would recommend them.I have been to a lot of car washes in town
Automotive,3.5,CG,"I use The Parking Spot 3. The attendants are friendly and professional. There is a shuttle service. You get to the terminal. The process is easy to understand, and you get to pay. The shuttle service is quick. I would use them again if I had to. Great service!  They found the problem within the hour and fixed it in a timely manner. I highly recommend them."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Paid for the Platinum wash and it didn't even look like it did before. I went back to get my car cleaned and the guy said they're the cheapest in the area and it's worth it. 

The next day I went to get my car cleaned and they didn't even bother to clean my car! 

I'll never go back to this place ever again!I went"
Automotive,2.0,CG,This was my first trip to this car wash and it was a great experience. I was just in a rush and had to get out of my car to go through the wash. The guys were very friendly and helpful. I'm a fan. I will be back!The staff was very helpful.  I was in and out in under an hour and they did a great job.  I will definitely be
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Stay clear of this place. They will lie to you and take your money for a car that you don't want. 

I will never take my car there again. I will tell everyone I know to not be fooled by this place. If I could give negative stars I would.I was looking to buy a new vehicle and I had a very good experience at this dealership. I test drove a"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Update.  Spoke to customer service rep and she informed me that she was going to fix the issue.  

I am not a mechanic but I am a mechanic.  I have been going to this location for years and will continue to do so with my cars.

They are a great place to get your oil change.  I have had several oil changes and inspections done there."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Smooth, fast and easy. Literally, it's an oil change. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a girl and have a credit card. I've been taking my car there for over 30 years, and it's always done well. If you have a credit card, you have to do it. I had to call them several times to check in."
Automotive,3.5,OR,I came here because I was In desperate need of 2 new tires. I was sent here by a friend and this company did not disappoint! They kept their promise on the cost of tires. They got my vehicle In quickly and i was in and out within 45 minutes. They checked my brakes while they were changing the tires a d gave me an honest opinion.  I will highly recommend this shop to many more!! Thank you for great service!!
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Quick and easy service for a tire change. The employees were very nice and explained everything about what was going on with my car very well. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was they forgot to reset the oil light, so I had to go back and make sure they gave me the oil and reset it so the dash showed that my oil life was actually at 100%. Will definitely go back for my car's maintenance in the future."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employee

This company is the absolute best at windshield replacement! They were flexible when I needed to change the on the spot repair site and the completed job was perfect! John is thorough and quick so I could get back on the road. Would definitely use them again! Thank you!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This is an update, changed from 1 to 3 stars. The 1 star review was because of lack of communication from the service technician. I took the car back and explained the issues to the managers. They spent the next 3 days taking to the technicians at in the shop and fixed most of the outstanding issues. The one outstanding issue yet to fix is because during my previous service the mechanic (different shop) had replaced non-genuine hyundai part causing the issue."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"After a terrible experience at a car dealer down the road. Z and Nada were awesome and worked their butts off to make the price range work for my 18 year. There was no bait and switch, they honored their promise. They made my son's first car buying experience top notch. Michael in finance was also great and not pushy. 

I highly recommend checking out Ferman Chevrolet if you are in the market for a new car ask for Z and Nada!!!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Wow! Just moved to the area and was blown away by the outstanding customer service from Dakota who was very knowledgeable about the services offered. The basic wash is only $7 and you can vacuum your car for free. No quarters, no rush before it shuts off on you, no hassle, no wait. We also really liked ""the ride"" of going in the car wash, very entertaining like Disneyland. We've decided that this is the place to get the car washed regularly."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Excellent no pressure visit. Mitul was so knowledgeable that we went for one truck and after he knew our needs he found a truck for us on the lot that was cheaper than the original one we went in for. Someone with truck knowledge as well as lot and stock knowledge  is hard to find these days. 
We had every answer to every question and the truck we purchased was perfect for us. Mitul made the whole visit simple and fun"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Freaky fast service! Only $19.95 pass or fail. I went to national chain store and was turned away for a smog check, because reportedly the DMV system was down at the time.  So I left the parking and immediately drove the 4 blocks down to Smog Monkey - absolutely the best experience I have had for this service.  I would bet that I spent less than 5 minutes total at the shop.  Rob is friendly, personable, and definitely efficient."
Automotive,5.0,OR,I wish I would of known about this place when I had my last car probably would of still had it these guys a great walked in the door and am greeted by name and is super awkward so I didn't know what to say alway so professional prices are so good I would be crazy to go somewhere else if you have a Volkswagen or Audi and you love your car then bring it here and you can thank me later
Automotive,4.0,OR,"These guys are blithering idiots. Took my Mercedes in for a simple oil change. I get about a mile away and start getting the overfill alert. Sooo.. Gotta take it back. What kind of an automobile service biz can't do an oil change? Beats me. But I found one. Then sometime later, I need to open the hood on the vehicle. Guess what. These clowns didn't even bother to put the engine cover back on it, Geez.. Gimme a friggen break, man."
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Terrible experience. They lost our business. The dealership is a joke. We had a lease and the salesman wasn't there. The salesmen were very nice, but the service department is horrible. We came in to test drive a 2017 Nissan Rogue. They told us that it was not available. We gave them our keys to the vehicle and they had to work on it for another 30 days."
Automotive,2.5,CG,I just want to mention that I had an oil change done at another dealership in the area and they did an awesome job! I will definitely be back!I bought a used car from this dealership and had it serviced at a different dealership. I had a problem with the car that I had a warranty with. I called and spoke to the service manager and he stated that I could bring it in for a new
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Eric was awesome. I actually had to wait an hour just for him to come up to me and tell me that I had a bad battery. He then said he would be able to get me in and get it fixed in 30 minutes. I had to wait an extra 30 minutes for the battery and a 2 hour wait to get it fixed. 

I would definitely come back here again for my next service"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"This is the only place that has the quality of work I need.

The guys here are knowledgeable and have the best prices in town. The work is done in a timely manner and it's a great value.

I will be coming back when I need work done on my vehicle.I had a great experience purchasing a car from here and it was a smooth transaction. They did not pressure me into"

Automotive,3.5,CG,"I am an unlimited customer. 

I have never had a bad experience at a car dealership. I have purchased several cars from a dealership and have never had a bad experience.

I have purchased many cars from them and have never had to wait more than 30 minutes for my car."
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Mid City saved me on $200 and the oil change was free.

The guys were very nice and professional. The waiting room was very clean and comfortable. I was in and out in less than an hour.

I will be back!I had a great experience at this location.  I was helped by Andrew, who was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I was told I needed a new tire"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"I cant ever think or recommend this place. 

I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation and had a coupon for a free tire rotation.  I was in and out in less than an hour.  I will be back for future service.I was very pleased with the service. I was in and out in under an hour and they did a great job. They even cleaned my car!"
Automotive,2.5,CG,The car wash is fine. But the inside of the car is a mess. The inside of the car is so dirty that it's a mess. The windows are not vacuumed and the carpets aren't wiped down. The inside of the car is dirty and the console isn't vacuumed. They don't have a single floor mat in the car and they don't clean the seats. I just went there
Automotive,1.5,CG,Absolute horrible experiance ever. Inquired about an suv and decided to purchase. Sales person was rude and acted like he didn't want to be there. The sales manager was not interested in his job. They had no clue where the suv was. I told him to contact the manager. He said he would call me back and call me back. I never heard back from him.
Automotive,5.0,CG,I took my car on a weekday and the oil light was on. I called the dealership and they said that they had to replace the valve cover and the oil pan cover. I took it to a local mechanic and they fixed it for $50. This was the first time I have ever had a problem with a car and I will be going to the dealer to get the parts. They did not charge me anything
Automotive,1.0,CG,"This company is used by some of the worst people in the world. They have the worst customer service. If you want to get your car fixed then the first time you go there it's worth it. 

They are horrible. They are rude and don't care. They are dishonest. They will lie to you and will tell you to call them to see if you can get a hold of them."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Their financial services were horrible. She lied about all financial options. One was that an $800 GAP insurance policy was mandated by the bank to get the loan type. I called the bank and they never require it. The other option could not be supported by any financial manager, its as if she made up that entire option. This places financial services are shaddy! I dont recommend this place at all, she lied as soon as her lips started moving."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I came at 8am as suggested on the phone. They told me it would take a couple of hours to finish it. Back breaks abs caliper it turned out. It's 3pm and I'm still sitting on this fucking chair. You cannot tell me it takes a couple of hours and make people wait 7 hours (at least, it's not done yet). I wanna hear from corporate on this one. The casual way they have wasted my whole day is unreal."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I took my vehicle in after some wonderful person damaged the passenger door and didn't stick around to take responsibility. Shocking, I know. Anyway, I ended up back there 3 times to fix overspray and other sloppy work. This was about a year ago. So why am I posting now? I have some paint damage on my lift gate that needs to be repaired. Guess where I won't be going? Management, you need some QC before those cars go back to the customer."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Called shop for a price for intermediate pipe and muffler on 5/22/2021 for a 2000 Corolla was quoted 250. 00. My mother took her car there and was charged 385. 00. Is this how they do business. They took advantage of my elderly mother and wouldn't horror the lifetime warranty. I feel ther were dishonest  the way they represented the 250. 00 price. Had we known the true price would have shopped around. Not very professional way to do business.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"It's been 18 months since I first leased my 2013 Honda Civic Si, and like I said on my previous review, it wasn't going to be my last time at Reno Honda. I had all my services done with honda, and I just went back to purchase a 2015 Civic. I want to thank Ron, Reggie, and Tom. They are all great people and they sincerely care about making my purchase very comfortable without any pressure. Thanks again, keep up the great work."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Charlie's Transmission was recommended by Big John's Auto Repair (John Clark) in St Pete.  John was right on with the recommendation.  Although I only came for maintenance, the price was quite competitive and the service excellent.  The reason for the one less star than perfect is that the reception was less than inviting.  I didn't feel like they wanted the business. I looked past it and, in the end, feel like I received good service for a fair price"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I made the mistake of not having the app (as a carwash member), which is essential to avoid fraud since they scan bar codes. The (I think he was the manager) was SUPER patient, and understanding with me. His phenomenal customer service changed my entire experience. 

The hand drying towels at the end left some unappealing streaks and marks on my car, but I got rid of them with my own towel - no big deal. Otherwise, it's a good and affordable carwash."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Called them as I was on the road with car trouble. It was late in the day but they told me that they would do their best to fit me in. Shuttled me home while they looked at my car. Called me within the hour and advised me of issues. Had my car ready the next afternoon and picked me up from work at a time that was convenient for me. Everyone was kind, considerate, and helpful. Thanks to Big Rob & Dana."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This is my goto place for car services.  They are excellent and explain completely all their recommendations before they do the work.

I had an engine rebuilt here after an unfortunate incident on I-95 (pothole during Hi-way construction).  Ran like new and all my subsequent service has been equally outstanding.  What you want in a car service garage (or tire place).  

Don't use them though, I want get this service for myself, without long delays or cheating from other places."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"the service department is outstanding but customer care (audi financial services)  is horrible.   The end of lease turn in experience is horrible.  Everyone refers you to the customer care line which has  a 30 minute wait.   The people that work at the dealer are clueless about end of lease questions and are not helpful.  I would not lease an Audi again.   Once your lease is up, no one will help you with anything."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I have had a slow leak in my tire for a few months (putting air in every few days). When I took my car to the dealership they advised the tire was fine. Finally, I took my car into Rubber City. After 5 minutes I was told my tire did have a leak, and 5 minutes later was shown the nail they took out of it. I'm very pleased, I was in and out in less than 1/2 hour and repair was $30."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Don't come here unless you have hours to burn.  Came in for a tire repair since I have the road hazard.  We have been here 4 hours and still waiting!!!  Half a day if our vacation GONE!  Had I know this I would have paid somewhere else.  No one working here even warned us the wait would be 4+ hours.  2.5 hours in, they told us we were next in line...1.5 hours after that, still here waiting."
Automotive,2.0,CG,I have rented an RV here a couple of times. I will continue to use the service and rent here from now on. I will rent from them again if I need a rental again.The customer service is excellent.  I've been coming here for years and I've never had a problem.  They have a fair price and I can't wait to bring my car back in.  I've had to take

Automotive,1.5,CG,"Have you ever seen the old reviews, you'd think I'd have my business.

I've had several cars repaired here, including my wife's car, a sports car, a Mercedes, and a few Mercedes. I've always had excellent service and always had a good experience with the guys. I have also had some issues with the steering wheel on my car, which is a problem I have had with the"

The hotel was nice and we stayed in the hotel for the night.  The hotel was clean and well kept.  We were told it would be a few hours for a hotel reservation.  We waited almost an hour and a half.

We picked up the hotel and the hotel was a little rough.  It was quite a bit"
Automotive,3.0,CG,Many thanks to the team at AutoNation Honda!I've been going to this car wash for years.  Every time I've been there they have been extremely friendly and helpful.  The only thing that I've had to do is vacuum the car.  The staff are very knowledgeable and always a pleasure to deal with.  I'm very happy with the service here.I love this place. I had to take
Automotive,4.5,CG,"These folks are awesome when it comes to customer service. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change.  The guy who worked on my car was nice and seemed like he was in good hands. Then when I asked him why he didn't give me an answer about the oil change I was told ""I don't know"". So I asked him why he didn't give me an"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I'm the type of person who has the personality of a mechanic. 

The guys here are knowledgeable and have the best prices in town. The work is done in a timely manner and it's a great value. 

I can't recommend them highly enough.Great service!  They found the problem quickly and did it in a timely manner.  I will definitely be back for any other service!"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Be careful of ""spot delivery"" here. The guys here are very rude and unprofessional. I just wanted a simple oil change and I was told that they have a ""good"" deal on oil changes. I told them that I'm not going to be going back to this location. The guys were extremely rude and seemed to be annoyed with me. I told them I was so upset that I didn't want to"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Well first off this is a dealership, they treat you like a human being, I don't know what that means. The people there are very polite, knowledgeable, and take care of you.

They make you feel like family and"

Thank you, guys!I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely helpful and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to get my car serviced. I will recommend them to"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"If you're car needs work with the brakes, it would make sense to go this place which specializes in them. The people working here are honest and not ready to overcharge you. I like the fact they don't charge you just to inspect brake pads and rotors. A lot of places would have charged $40 for that. The brake fluid flush they did was also very reasonable. 
Although the place gets busy so do expect to wait a while until the service is completed."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Worst car wash in town. Came in they showed me a menu of different levels of car wash. I selected the super wash at  31.99. They assured me it's the best, when they were done , I had to walk around the car and showed them all the dirty spots they missed.They had an attitude when I told them to clean it. If you want a clean car don't come here . Your wasting you money and time. Terrible Service hands down !!!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I can't say enough good things about Rick & Kevin and his staff of auto techs. They are fair and have always been accommodating and helpful without being condescending. I have been brining vehicles here since 2001 and will continue to do so. They're hands down the best. The staff are so welcoming and friendly and of course the job was extremely well done,. not a long wait.
 I recommend this shop to everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Keep up the good work Rick & Kevin Talleyvile the Best!!!!!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,I paid for A $30 car wash and my car was absolutely disgusting inside it when I complained about it the Latino kids told me well you didn't pay for a full detail this is what you get I get my car wash there every single weekend and that usually do a good job but after today I can tell you I will never go there I will never patronize those people again and the way they washed my car wasn't worth a dollar
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Very happy with the quick service (and knowledgeable staff) that was provided for my 2006 Honda Pilot when an irreparable hole from a roofing nail was found in one of the tires. I was able to get the car in on a Saturday morning and get two tires replaced, after it was explained to me why this was necessary. I appreciated the quick service because I needed to drive it out of town the next day. I will definitely recommend this business to others!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Was able to come to my office and remove two dents in my passenger side front wheel well. They managed my expectations that there was a chance it wasn't going to be ""perfect"" given the location of the dents, but it came about better than I expected. They even buffed out some ancillary scratches on my passenger door (not dented area) and around the dent. My car looks better than I expected and appreciate their quick turnaround in getting me on their schedule :)"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"The Brake Tag guy is RIDICULOUS. I owed $27 & he refused to take 1 of my bills because it was stained. I had to dig for loose change to pay him.
The money was not wet or sticky....just old & stained. I got it as change from Rouse's yesterday. I don't know why he chose to be so difficult. He is usually nice. I go here every year. Will find a new place next year cuz who wants to deal with someone so petty?"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"This company is the absolute worst! Please save yourself the aggravation and rent from a reputable company. My vacation was ruined because I had to spend hours being transferred from person to person after they overcharged me for a rental. Despite dropping off my rental car on time, Sixt didn't check in the car until 3 hours later and then charged me for an additional day. This is the second time I've had issues with Sixt in as many rentals. Stay away! FAR AWAY!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"AWESOME!!!  Alan and Jason are truly honest and hardworking...  Not to mention their knowledge and expensive equipment that will get ANY job done the right way.  Don't even know how they can offer such low prices given the crazy competition. If you ever find a mechanic who talks you out of doing extra work or needlessly spending money, YOU MARRY THEM. Been a while since I've encountered this RARITY, they are a dying breed, and I never walk away from loyalty."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"These guys are great!! Honest and didn't try to upsell me on anything. I truly appreciate that. My check engine light came on, I had the code but not a clue what it meant. The gentleman explained it to me, let me know the cost prior to any work, and fixed it with no problems. It was an all day affair but that's because the place was packed!! Totally recommend and will definitely bring my car back if she needs service in the future!!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Let me start off by saying that I hate anything to do with car maintenance or repair.  However, the people who work at Big O Tires seem to be the nicest people in the world.  They checked my flat tire, filled it up with air, and assured me that it was fine FREE OF CHARGE!  So when we needed to buy four new tires, guess where we went?  These people are great AND I think their prices are very good."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"My truck had been ""keyed"" along the rear quarter panel. I went to Maaco and they were just too expensive and unorganized so I came to Caliber and they sat me down (they let me bring my dog into the office too) did all the paperwork, dealt with my insurance, and gave me a much more affordable estimate. The job was done perfectly and ahead of schedule!!! I will be using them again soon for work on my wife's car. They are the best!!!"
Automotive,3.0,CG,My husband and I have been coming here for over 15 years. They have always been friendly and knowledgeable. The people are always very polite and knowledgeable. They do not try to sell you everything you need. They also have a very good coffee selection. We have used them for years and it has always been great. I highly recommend them.
Automotive,2.5,CG,I had given up hope that I would be able to continue to work with him. He has been a great salesman and I am a loyal customer. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a new car. It was a pleasure to work with him. I will be back.I would give a zero if I could.  I went in to get a simple tire repair and they told me my tire had to be replaced
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Called ahead to schedule an appointment for the weekend and they said it would take 2 hours.  When I arrived at the appointment time, they took my car out to the garage and took a look.  They found out it was a timing chain problem.  After some waiting, they said they could take it to another shop and get a second opinion.  I showed up at the shop and was told that they couldn"
Automotive,3.0,CG,We can not thank Lazydays enough for the outstanding customer service we received from us. We were looking to purchase a new RV and we were looking to get the first one. The sales manager was very knowledgeable and friendly. He listened to our needs and wants and made sure we were getting the best deal. We will be back to Lazydays and would recommend Lazydays to anyone looking for a new RV.
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Very rude can't answer questions, will never ever purchase a car from them, just tell you one thing and then tell you the other, ""we're not going to do it"".I have been going to this location for years and have always had excellent service.  I have had several issues with my car and have always been pleased with the service.  They are very professional and take great care of their customers. "
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Big fat zero!  The woman behind the counter was very rude and dismissive!  She was rude.  She was very pushy, and took her time out of her day.  The only good thing about this place is that they're located right next to the Starbucks.  The only thing that's really nice is the fact that they are open until 8:00 AM!  They're open until 8:00"
Automotive,3.5,CG,I recently purchased a set of 4 Michelin tires from this location.  The entire process was quick and painless.  I will definitely return for any tires I need.  Thank you!I had an excellent experience at Precision Toyota. I was greeted with friendly and knowledgeable staff. I had a very pleasant experience. I was in and out in less than an hour. I highly recommend Precision Toyota for anyone looking for a
Automotive,1.5,CG,"Absolutely went here because of the reviews and the good reviews.

The actual car wash itself is a little pricey but the staff is friendly and efficient.

However, I would like to say that this is where the good ends. I wish I had read the reviews before going here. They do a decent job and it's a good car wash. I think they're great. I just went there to get a"
Automotive,4.5,CG,Got my 17-point oil change here. The guys were friendly and professional. They did a thorough job. They didn't try to sell me anything that I didn't need. They were quick to go over everything and let me know how to change my oil. I will be back.I would give a zero if I could.  I went in to get a simple tire repair and they told me my tire had to
Automotive,4.5,CG,Owners are always nice.  We have had our cars serviced at Reedman Toll for over 30 years.  The service is always great.  The staff is always courteous and professional.  We have been in the market for a new car for several years and we have never been disappointed.  We have also found the staff to be very knowledgeable and knowledgeable.  We also have a very great sales experience
Automotive,4.0,CG,"My husband and I wanted to trade in our 2017 Jeep Cherokee. We had a very good experience. We had an excellent experience. The process took about 20 minutes, and it was a great experience. We were able to make a deal on a car. The car was well worth the money and a great deal on it. We also got a great deal on our trade in. We will definitely be back."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Horrible service!!! Walked in for a simple oil change and they didn't even charge me for the oil change.  Had a coupon for a ""free"" car wash, so I decided to give it a try.  I pulled in, they were busy, and I was waiting for my car to be pulled in.  I was in and out in less than an hour.  They even offered to take a"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I set up an appointment Wednesday for an alignment on Friday. I was told it would be less than an hour. Got there at 1230--at 130 the car had not been pulled in yet. Appointments apparently are not appointments. So 30 min drive over and back, and the hour in the middle of a busy day...lost. 

Merriam-Webster says an ""Appointment is an agreement to meet at a specific time."" Everyone's time is important. This is probably a good company--needs to work harder to become great."
Automotive,4.0,OR,I came in to check my oil since the maintenance light had come on and my levels were low. I was afraid I was having troubles with a gasket I had just had fixed. The gentleman who helped me let me know my engine is notorious for burning oil and to just check the levels every so often. He then filled up my oil and coolant! I would 100% recommend this place for anyone in Nashville who needs a quick oil check up or change.
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Hi. I needed a towing job for my car. It had a flat tire. It was scheduled through my insurance company for a specific time and they did not arrive at that time. I called them and was told it would be another hour. Waited and they still did not arrive. Called again and was told a towing truck would arrive in 45 minutes. Once again, no truck arrived. Called them again but had to leave a voicemail. Avoid this towing company like the plague!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Took a friend's car here for an inspection. A part had rotted and a recent battery change messed with the emissions readings, but Pete was very friendly and explained everything well. AC started clicking a few days later so I took it back and he immediately took a peek at the motor and adjusted it saying it should probably be looked more in depth in the fall but was fine for now. Very nice to take the time to quickly review the situation for me."
Automotive,2.0,OR,I have rented cars mainly because my car was getting repaired. But since I have lost my car due to it being deemed totaled. I haven't had a pleasant experience until I rented from here. It's actually Avis/Budget rentals. Needless to say Alicia was exceptional. She was knowledgeable and helped me out tremendously. I would recommend this place. Also inexpensive compared to enterprise where I have rented in the past.
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Was prequalified for a loan and referred to this dealership. I told them not waste my time ahead of time. I told them my maximum monthly payment. I filled out two applications, sent 5 emails, and made 6 phone calls talking to these idiots. They called and made me the worst possible offer for a car that was in an accident, during this pandemic, and while knowing I had financial issues, and they demanded an outrageous amount of money down. Stay away from this place."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I bought a 2012 Toyota Prius from salesman Rory Thomas in January 2018. I was supposed to receive two key fobs but only received one. After multiple emails and calls with Rory, I emailed his sales manager about the issue and never received a response. This is my first modern car I ever bought and I didn't know key fob's cost $200 each. It was clearly stated on my key ring there are two key fobs. I am very disappointed they couldn't make this right."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"So I went here for an oil change about a week or ago.  I was told I need front brakes and rotors and back rotors.   They wanted to fix that day but I said no.  They told me everything was so bad that I wouldn't pass inspection.  Well, I went to my own mechanic and I did need new front brakes but nothing else and my car did pass inspection.   These guys were trying to rip me off!!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I'm particular about my car. I hand-wax it twice a year, keep it clean and shiny - you know what I mean. I sustained damage - a small dent, a deep scratch, scuffed paint. I took it to this location. The service was excellent, really nice people; the job they did was impeccable, AND they back up their work! There's nothing like a good job done for a fair price, and walking away feeling like you've been treated well and you're happy with the outcome."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Brought my car in for an oil change because it was on the way home, and am now a permanent customer. I lucked out on timing, catching them at a moment with no other customers, and a full crew, so the entire visit took 20 minutes. The man who helped me (whose name I can't recall, unfortunately), was very nice, professional, patient, and informative. I really appreciate that he didn't try to upsell me on anything I didn't need, and took care of everything that did."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I didn't have any actual work to my car done at Carsmetics but they did three Carco insurance inspections for me recently. The office is immaculately clean and bright. The people I dealt with on both occasions were very friendly, pleasant and helpful. 

If I did need body work done on any of our cars I would definitely bring my car here based on my experience. Carsmetics does a lot of work for the various dealers and they look like they do top quality work."
Automotive,2.5,OR,I emailed Brett about two weeks and there was no response from him. Called the dealership and explained the situation and their only response was that coupon (this was sent from the dealership) was applied. It was not because if it was I would not be dealing with this issue. Horrible customer service and their coupons ( they are theirs and they mail them to you) are a total scam. Will not be going back and will be going to Tampa Honda from now on
Automotive,2.5,CG,"By far the most high quality of service I have ever received. 

The customer service is outstanding and the prices are reasonable.

Automotive,4.0,CG,"I've been coming to my car for the last two years.  

The first time I came in for a simple oil change, they said the car needed a new battery and that it needed a new battery.  I said no and told them I was still waiting.  They said it would be a few hours and they would call me right back.  

Two hours later I got a call from"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Horrible customer service.  Went in for an oil change and was told they didn't have the oil in stock so I had to get a ride to the dealership.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"Will never bring my car here again and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I have had to replace a valve cover on my car, which was installed incorrectly by the dealership.

Automotive,2.5,CG,Clean rest spot. Needs a little more attention.Went for a wash and wax. I got the $10 off the phone. The guys were very friendly and did a great job.

Automotive,3.0,CG,"Dealing with car salesmen has been an unpleasant experience.  I visited this dealership for a trade-in and an oil change.  The process took about an hour, so it was pretty quick.

Automotive,5.0,OR,The guys at Henry's are the friendliest in St Louis! They are laid back but they still get the job done fast. Fair prices too. They are very transparent and willing to explain stuff unlike some shops that treat you like a dummy. I brought in some low profile tires and they didn't complain about it at all unlike most shops. From what I've seen these guys do top-notch work. And they even play Jimmy Buffet on the garage floor... What more could you ask for?
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I really like how close they are to our house but not a fan of the $.35 charge they add without telling you to every credit and debt card purchase. I like to support local owned business and I still on occasion get gas and snacks. I would become more of a regular I'd they dropped the charge.

They do have a great selection of food and drinks. The gas is usually pretty competitive in price.

If they get rid of the surcharge I will raise my rating."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Thank you for your reply, I called and left a voicemail for the guy you asked me to call over a week ago, he has not replied.

I also had another employee contact me to ask about service, I told him as well of the situation, he was to look into it and get back with me.  I still have not heard back, its been 6 days.

So now, that is 3 or 4 people that I have had contact with, but not a single follow up."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Went to get my car washed since it seemed like the rain was over yesterday. As soon as I pull out of the wash it starts pouring rain. The attendant said he would give another wash if it rained, so I came back today. Different attendant tells me that they don't do that and haven't done that since 2016. Umm wtf. 

Car wash wasn't even that good anyway. The whole front was still dirty and still dust in areas when I left yesterday. This company sucks."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I drive alot, my tires were BAD. My bad for not attending to them sooner.  I called all around Santa Barbara and Goleta because I wasn't sure I'd make it safely back down to San Gabriel.  I got best quote from Ian's. They beat the other shops by $100 on 4 tires. They sold me a good brand that was being discontinued. I got good tires and my car is once again driving great. Thanks Ian's for such great work and a good deal!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I went to look at a car on Saturday, this dealership is not five stars any longer, the car was not in good shape and had a lot of vibration from driving right away, and when I got on the freeway the steering wheel was visibly shaking and sales person brought it to service dept, who said the car is fine basically a car that go 65 miles an hour on the freeway has a aggressively shaking steering wheel is satisfactory for Acura to sell, amazing"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"UPDATE: Mungenast reached out to us to offer repairs and a free of charge rental. Great! However, the people we dealt with grew increasingly rude as we tried to explain our water problem, and worst of all...they SCRATCHED OUR CAR WHILE MAKING THE REPAIRS! Totally unprofessional and ridiculous! I appreciate the effort made to try to make things right...but it was half-hearted at best, and now we are left with a ding-ed up and scratched driver's door and inexplicable pink streaks and scratches on the hood."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I needed service to my AC on my 2017 Kia Soul as soon as possible due to a clogged drain tube.  Made my appointment online and was able to get in later that same day on a Saturday.  From my initial greeting from Gerard to my final handshake after service, I was treated with respect and kindness.  I left feeling like they genuinely valued my business and my problem was completely resolved.  I highly recommend them and appreciate their professionalism and expertise."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I cannot say enough great things about this business! I realized Friday afternoon my tire was flat. I had taken it to another tire shop a week prior and they didn't catch what was causing the leak, but these guys did immediately! They got me right in, welded my cracked rim, and got me back on the road safely and quickly. Their customer service is unmatched! If you ever find yourself in a bind in St. Louis, this is where you take your vehicle."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Honestly they'll treat you good when you're looking for a car, they'll bring you the moon and stars, but once you've actually made the deal with them they treat you like garbage, I called once to see if they could erase the check tire pressure light from my car and the same dude was answering me with an attitude, and he never got back to me nor did they ever make the appointment with ziebart for my car. Honestly would not recommend this place at all."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"My car was returned with used parts. The estimate showed all new parts but a lot of old parts were straightened out and reused.  Parts we're glued back together with plastic bond. Front emblem was broken off grill and glued on new grill. This place charged my insurance company a lot, what I received was a botched repair. Do not go here.The headlight I needed was replaced with a used one. I noticed these repairs after my car was sent to dealership for a recall."
Automotive,4.5,CG,This shop is certified in the US and the owner is a real professional who is very personable. He is not the only person who has done the work and has been great to work with.

Automotive,3.0,CG,5-21-2016 I got a phone call from the dealership and they said they were going to fix the issue. I called the dealership and they said they would get back to me. They never did. I called and they said they would call me back. I called and they said they would not be able to get to me. I called them again and they said they would call me back. I called again and they said
Automotive,3.5,CG,"I have had my monthly pass for the last two years.  

The first time I went, I had to get a wash and then the car wash took a long time to dry.  

The second time, I went for the car wash.  The machine was a bit confusing with the wash and I had to be right on the line to get through.  I went through the automatic car wash and"
Automotive,3.0,CG,Love my Forester.  Would definitely recommend them.Went in to get my tire patched and the guy here said it was a bad tire. He then said he didn't have time to look at it and it would be $80.00. I told him I was waiting and he said no problem. I was there and he had me out in less than an hour. I will be back.This place is awesome.
Automotive,5.0,CG,"Shane and the rest of the staff at the front desk were all very helpful and I was in and out within an hour! I will definitely be back!I bought a car from this dealership. They had it for a good price, they had it for a good while. The car was clean and they had a lot of stuff to make the car look better than new. I also got a great deal on the car and the"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"so my other car was stolen. The dealership has no integrity and they need to be fired.Great experience. Great people. I will definitely be back!I bought a car from this dealership. They had it for a good price, they were very professional and friendly. I would definitely buy from them again.I came to this location on a Saturday and was greeted by Chris. He was very polite and explained all the services I needed"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I've had a good experience here last time my car needed service. Today (9/10/2018), I needed two light bulbs replaced on my car and was quoted $135. Instead I went to Napa Auto and paid $19 for parts and it took ME (not a very handy lady) only 12 minutes to replace both lightbulbs following the instructions in the DIY section of my car user manual. Quite an unreasonable quote for the very small job. Valvoline does this for $11. 99 per lightbulb and Walmart Auto for $7."
Automotive,3.5,OR,I went through the car wash this week and a piece of my trim had fallen off they came to me and said they would have it fixed if I would come back in three days the manager was extremely kind and helpful!! I went back in three days and they did as they said and replace the part at no charge and then provided me a complementary interior and exterior cleaning and were so kind and thoughtful I said wow customer service that's amazing!! Thank you
Automotive,4.0,OR,"With a pleasant attitude, they do what needs to be done and no more.

My car is in great shape and my repair bills way down since I started coming to Fred's.

I wondered out loud once if my 11 year-old Subaru with 95,000 miles was getting too old to fix. One of the workers there laughed and told me his Subaru Legacy (same model I had) was 15 years old and had 150,000 miles. You don't need to be embarrassed to bring in an old car to Fred's."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Worst Mazda dealer in the area . Every time I go in there all you get is attitude. The service department is slow and expensive. I never heard of a modern day business closing for lunch where they won't answer the phone at lunchtime. That's the only time I can call to find out what's going on with my car. Don't go here and waste your time there are three other Mazda dealers in the area. Not close to my house but not worth the aggravation either.
Automotive,1.5,OR,"DO NOT PARK ANYWHERE IN THE FRENCH QUARTER THAT YOU SEE THESE SIGNS

This company is a scam, they look for ways to boot your vehicle and charge you $90 to get it back off. 

Our vehicle was a rental with current plates and the plates matched the receipt yet they wouldn't talk about it and wouldn't remove boot until I paid $90...the Ticket says ""Invalid Plates right on it. 

We got frustrated and left New Orleans early after this incident...just one more way they gouge in NOLA'!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This location is not operated like the Team Toyota in Langhorne which I've been patronizing for years. Very disappointing. They say they take walk ins, but you have to wait for hours. Can never get an appointment for the time I want either. One time my husband and I brought our cars in within a few weeks of eachother for service and they claimed that  both vehicles had the same problem. Seemed very fishy. We will be looking for another place to get our cars serviced."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Kaleb was super genuine and was not the stereotypical car salesman. First of all, he knew a lot about the cars and was super helpful to give me information. I left to go test drive another car from a different dealership and immediately was drawn to the Mazda more. I got a good trade-in price and a good price on the car so it was meant to be. I'm very satisfied with everyone that helped me out, but especially Kaleb! Thanks again for my (first) new car!!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Like an idiot I decided to get a second car from this dealership.
First thing is that it's changed management and lots of staff but not for the better. The old manager used to reach out to customers who have had bad experiences but not the new one. 
Second thing is make sure you get your offer and deal in writing because they change their minds and don't tell you. 
If I could I would hand my car back now and never deal with these scam artists again."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Don't park here.  They do not watch your car.  My car was damaged at Winner and they contacted me about the damage caused while I was away traveling.  When I returned, they would not fix the damage, they would not give me their insurance company's name, and they still charged me for the parking.  The one essential understanding is that my car will be safe while parked at their facility...they failed and would not stand behind the damage caused in their parking lot!"
Automotive,3.0,CG,I have been going here for a couple years now and I will continue to go there.  They do an awesome job and I am always impressed by the service.  They do a great job and I trust them with my cars.I had an appointment with Mike to replace a window motor and a tire. I was greeted by a young man who was very nice and helpful. He told me to come right over and he would take care
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Now called Prime Car Wash. a $10 car wash and a $10 car wash for the $19. 99 package. The people there are very polite, professional, and take care of their customers. They have a very clean car waiting area with some nice refreshments. They also have a TV and coffee bar. There's a coffee bar so you can watch while you wait."
Automotive,2.0,CG,This is the worst business I have ever experienced.  I will never ever go back to them.I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Elantra from Tye.  I was very pleased with my purchase.  The sales manager was very helpful.  He was very friendly and accommodating.  The service department is the best I have ever dealt with.  I will definitely be buying another Hyundai in the future.I was referred to
Automotive,1.5,CG,Would give 0 stars if I could.  We went in to trade in a car and the salesman (I am the best) acted like he didn't care about the customers.  We had to take our car in to be repaired.  They told us to come back in 3 weeks and they would call us to let us know.  We never heard back from them.  We called again and had to leave a message and call
Automotive,4.5,CG,"I had a great buying experience here and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a car.I have used this place twice and both times it was a great experience.  Both times they were very professional and friendly.  The staff is always extremely friendly and they are the most professional in the business.  I have never had an issue with my car, and I highly recommend it to"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"They quickly and professionally addressed the issue and let me know what was going on. I was given a free oil change and a complimentary inspection. 

I was in and out in about an hour. 

Thank you, guys!I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I had a nail in my tire and they were able to fix it for free. I would definitely recommend them!Great"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"Another vehicle made a blind spot on the side of my car.  When I got home, the passenger side window had a spot on it and the windows were not vacuumed.  The passenger side door still had dirt on it.  I asked if I could speak to the manager and he said no.  I will never go back and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place.  This place is a rip off and"
Automotive,1.0,CG,"we had our Nissan rogue serviced at the dealership. 

The service advisor was awesome. He was super friendly and helpful. He took the time to explain the problem and made sure we understood everything. It was a very busy day and I had to get to work. He also had a shuttle service to come to us when we were in the area.

I highly recommend this dealership for service!This is the worst car"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I take my car here regularly. The guys are honest and will work with you to make sure you get the best deal. I will recommend this place to everyone I know. I will definitely go back. 

Thank youI came here for an oil change and tire rotation. I had a tire emergency and I was told it would take about an hour to complete. I got there about an hour after they closed and was told that"
Automotive,4.0,CG,By far the best and most honest mechanic I've ever dealt with. He is the best! I highly recommend him.If I could give zero stars I would. I was in a bad accident and had to get my car towed to this shop. My boyfriend and I were given the run around and they told him to come back in a few hours and they would start working on it. They never called us back and they kept pushing us
Automotive,4.5,CG,"We were traveling and had a flat tire. We called Tires Plus and they got us right in. They checked the tire and found a nail in the tire, fixed it, and we were on our way. Thank you so much for such a great service!I was very pleased with the service. I was in and out in under an hour and they even gave me a ride home while my car was being serviced."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"I,m scared & alone, after reading the reviews on here, I decided to give them a try. I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the work, but the price was very reasonable. I was pleasantly surprised by the cost, which was about half what I was expecting. The staff was friendly, professional, and quick to respond. I had to wait on my car to be finished, but I didn't expect much."
Automotive,4.5,CG,"While on vacation, I got a flat tire.  I called AAA and they said I could come in and get it fixed.  The guys at the shop were friendly and helpful.  The tire was fixed in about 15 minutes and they were honest about what was wrong.  The staff was also extremely helpful and nice.  I will definitely be back!I had a great experience at this location. I had to have my car serv"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Came to get my electrical outlet fixed.  It was to be 50 bucks.  They slipped little stuff here and there, and it ended up being 300 plus dollars.  They are sharks.  AND 80 percent of the time they did not even touch my car.  I WAITED 7 hrs for a 2 hr job.   DON'T GO THERE, they will rip you off.  Update: The electrical outlets, (to charge cell phone, etc) ....by the way are not all fixed.  Just checked."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This is a busy gas station but they keep it clean and they've got stations for you to check out your own purchases inside.  They have a wide array of products to pick from. 

I feel like if you're going to pump my gas, especially because it's the law, that I shouldn't have to wait four or five minutes for you to come over and help me! If I am stopped at the gas station I may also have to use the bathroom. You're killing my timing."
Automotive,4.5,OR,Used Smart Park for the first time during Thanksgiving week. Had a little difficulty finding it at night but that's on me and GPS. As soon as we parked a van was there to load our luggage and take us to the airport. The driver was very friendly and gave us tips for our return. I called when we returned and the van must have been in the cell phone lot because it was there in minutes. The service was seamless. Price was good. Will use them again.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Extremely impressed!  I had a complete detail with the headlights buffed and the engine steam cleaned.  All aspects were exceptional and extremely thorough.  The best detail I've ever had on one of my vehicles.  Seat stains were removed, all surfaces were shined without being greasy; same with the exterior and engine.  Staff was friendly and service was prompt.  I felt like it was the good ole days when a man's word and a handshake meant something!  They delivered what they promised."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Worst Big O Tire ever. Went for simple tire rotation this morning. When the guy starts off with ""my manager gets real mad at me if I don't ask for paperwork...."" don't you have a computer system that shows we bought the tires from you??? You are staring at a computer- do you know how to use it? Did I mention you had NO other customers? Hmmm. So we drove over to our usual Big O. They never asked for paperwork. They seem busy too. Do the math."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Agreed, they are awesome. Ignore the ho-hum storefront, these people REALLY care about making your car look as good as it can. There was a scheduling misunderstanding that resulted in my car being not quite ready when I needed to pick it up; Yvette offered to come all the way to the Main Line to pick it up and finish the work, and she was so nice about it. My sweet old CR-V looks really great, dog hair and odor are gone, and it truly shines."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Do not buy a used car from them. If you see the vehicle on an internet search screen shot the add because they are sleazy used car scam artists. Internet sales team lies lies lies!!! So take picture of internet search result so you can catch them in their lies!!----------
And as of today the add for the suv states no repairs were made to the suv and price was lowered! Goes to show how dishonest the dealership is, because they clearly stated repairs were made to the suv!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,This station is family owned. I highly recommend them. I drive a little out of my way to go there. They are so friendly and take good care of you and your car. I hardly ever have to wait.  They don't try to oversell you something you don't need.  Dominic is the owner and he was fantastic.  He even gave my dog a nice treat.  Reasonably priced. Great Customer Service. They are personable and they don't treat you like just another human coming through.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Aparently appointments mean nothing more than wishful thinking. An hour and a half after my schedules appointment i see my car rolling into the service bay. The two hour wait that they quoted a walk in is the same as my turn around time with an appointment. The up side is that i have received two hours of training on how PB up sells customers. There are 20 places listed in Yelp, within 5 miles of this location. I'll try them ALL before i waste another morning here."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Haven't even gotten my oil changed yet and wanted to post this review. It's a Saturday and they are a little busy-good for them!   Am in line and they quickly acknowledged me and brought me and the other person in line an ice cold bottle of water!  We have been coming here for many years. They are experienced, courteous and the convenience of staying in your car is certainly a plus!    Also they will reset your change oil notification!!!!
Thank you Safe Lube!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I was in an accident on the 101 because something flew off of someone's overpacked truck and into my windshield. My windshield, bumper, mirror and hood were all damaged as a result. 

Precision Auto Body took great care to repair my vehicle as quickly as possible. They went above and beyond the call of duty by cleaning the exterior and interior of my car as well as replacing the battery in my key fob. Gabriel was excellent, knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire process! 

I HIGHLY recommend them."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I have to say, that I purchased a lot of vehicles in my day including other Mercedes Benz and this dealership by far is the ABSOLUTE worse. Their service department could care less and are only concerned about selling you and extended warranty. I purchased a 2018 GLC 300 three months ago and I need service already. This dealership need to take some lessons in what customer service is.  I would never recommend this dealership!!!  WARNING - They also own Audi and Porsche of Cherry Hill!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"We took our truck in for oil change, new battery and overall check before a road trip.  They said we needed to replace the engine belt, which we did.   Five days later, 150 miles from home on a Sunday afternoon, the new belt shredded.  We had to stay overnight in a hotel and have the old ""new belt"" replaced again.  There was no indication of any reason the belt should have failed unless it was a defective product or it was incorrectly installed."
Automotive,3.5,CG,I love the quality and customer service I receive here. I will continue to go here for all my tire needs. Thank you to the staff and the owner for making this a smooth experience. Thank you for being honest. I brought my car here after having a flat tire. They fixed it within 30 minutes. They did a great job and they were extremely friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend them.
Automotive,3.5,CG,My grandparents came to visit this dealership and bought a vehicle for them. When we got home the salesman (I am the best) acted like he was the only one in the sales business that we came into contact with.  We were told it was going to take two weeks to get the vehicle.  We ended up going to the dealer and got the vehicle we wanted.  After two weeks we went to the dealership to look at the vehicle
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Not reliable at all! I had an appointment with them and was told by my insurance company that they would get me in the next day, but they never got to my appointment. I was told by the insurance company that they would be able to get me in and get my car fixed for the following day. I was also told that they would call me right back with updates as to the status of my car. When I called back, the"
Automotive,3.0,CG,My son took over payments and had the car towed there for a safety inspection. I was told by a manager that the car would be ready by the end of the day. I was told it was ready by the end of the day. I told him I was still waiting on the car and was told that they hadn't gotten to it yet. I was told that they had already made a mistake and had to take it back in to get
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Although Valvoline (Levittown) advertises on their website that they have a good deal on oil changes, but they are a rip off. The people who work here are the most dishonest and incompetent people I have ever encountered. 

I took my car there for an oil change and they told me the oil was too low for the oil and that I had to replace it with a new filter. They didn't mention that"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"This place is the BEST!  The guys here are knowledgeable, friendly, and the customer service is top notch.  The people here are also very helpful and honest.  I would definitely go back.  It's a great place to get your car service.I have had several issues with my car and have had the most difficult experience. I have had several issues with my car. I was charged almost $200 for a simple oil change"
Automotive,2.5,CG,Service Department has some serious issues with the dealership and they are either not happy or totally incompetent. I will never purchase a car from this dealership and I have no intention of purchasing another vehicle from them. I have been in contact with the dealership multiple times and I have yet to receive a call back. I will continue to do so because I can trust the sales department to do the right thing for me. This is not a reputable dealership and they
Automotive,3.0,CG,"just got off phone with the owner and the owner. He did not offer to fix the issue. He said he would have the parts in and get back to me. The parts manager was not there. 

I am currently on hold for over 20 minutes to find someone who would be willing to help me. I am also on hold for over 30 minutes to get ahold of someone. I will never use this company again and will"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Was passing through on a weekend. The dealership was closed for the weekend, so I was just able to get in the car. The guys at the front desk were so nice and helpful. They were extremely friendly and helped me out. They were busy but I was able to get in and out within about 15 minutes. I will definitely be back!I had to wait 3 hours for a tow.  This was not a big deal for me"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I ordered my tires online.  I arrived at the store and they were all ready for me.  I waited in the waiting room for about 45 minutes before a customer came out and asked what I needed.  I was told I needed four new tires.  I waited in the waiting room and a woman came over to the store and said ""I need one"".  I explained I needed two new tires.  I asked if they could"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"If I could give 10 stars I would. 

I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation.  The guy behind the counter said the tires were fine, and it was ready to go when I arrived.  

I had a coupon for $12 off the price.  I was also impressed with the convenience of having the mechanic walk me through the process.  I went there to pick up my car and they"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Just an okay place. The service was quick and well performed (tire rotation), however I found their customer service to be repulsive. I asked for them to wipe out the inside of the rims while they were off of the car to remove the brake dust, and I was straight up told no and immediately dismissed. The guy at the counter gave me a lot of attitude. Only reason why they don't have 1 star is because it was done in about an hour and it was only $12."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Well like all fly by night tire shops they did all the wrong stuff. Called for a quote the day before and of course was over charged when I got there it was $25 more. Also told them how to put the spare back in and of course they could not do that corectly. The guy was nice like most rip off artist are but hey when you are from out of town this is what you will get every time.  Plus side they did have free coffee.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Ben and his staff are hands down the friendliest auto shop people I've ever dealt with. Ben diagnosed and located my AC problem in moments after my description of the issue. The man knows his stuff. More, he talked me out of a repair that would cost more than my car is worth. No other shops would do that. That is integrity. I got an AC recharge on the house and was only asked to consider his shop for future repairs. He has made an ongoing customer of me."
Automotive,2.5,OR,My first visit was a good one. I had some major issues with my car - they took care of it and described in detail what needed to be done. Was told the full price - no hidden fees. I felt Norm l (manager) was honest and he answered all my questions and concerns. Although they are very busy - they manage it well. Busy is a good thing when it comes to an obviously popular garage like this one. Will definitely return for any future auto maintenance needs.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"We had a pretty good experience with fast park and relax. It is definitely way quicker than the normal airport economy lot and cheaper too. All of the drivers we had were super nice. I felt very safe leaving my car there for a week. 

I have a business idea for them, they need an app! That way your parking spot can be loaded into the app and you don't have to worry about saving the little slip of paper the bus driver gives you to remember your spot."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Came in to have the truck we bought looked over. These guys were great. Turns out we bought a bad truck but they took care of us. Still needs tons of work and they will get it. They took us in right away and did what they could to get is back home safe, some 150 miles away. Great customer service and superb vehicle service. I will bring the truck back to be fixed the correct way. If I trust them with my baby so should you. Great place."
Automotive,2.5,OR,I got a flat tire on my way to work and I was trying to find a place that could replace it and came across Mavis discount tire. I HIGHLY recommend this place! The staff was amazing and efficient! I told them I was already late to work and they pulled my car right into the garage and began working on it right away. Dave was wonderful. He explained everything to me and showed me what exactly was wrong with my tire. I couldn't be more satisfied.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This place is less than 15 minutes away from me so I decided to go here and get oil change yesterday. One on my Toyota Tacoma and one on my Toyota FJ. This place was amazingly fast and the service was extraordinaire. I did not even know that they have military discount nor did I know there was $3 off when you bring your second vehicle on the same day. They automatically added it on my payment before I even asked. 
I'll surely be back here for oil changes!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Everyone here is super friendly, for starters. Not once did I feel like they were talking down to me or price gouging me because a woman dared to walk in by herself. A different mechanic told me I had a nuisance noise...that was getting progressively worse. (?!?) The crew at Richard's pin pointed the problem immediately and fixed it within two hours for a very reasonable price. My car drives and sounds like a dream again, thanks to this shop. I'll be back and recommending this place to everyone!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This shop was so great, I went in for an oil change and a transmission oil change. I had previously taken my car to the dealership to get it serviced but was not happy with the service so I was referred to airport motors and I'm so happy I tried it out. They are very nice and efficient, they didn't try to sell me on anything I didn't need I really felt like they were trying to save me as much money as possible. I am definitely going back."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"We are from out of town and made an appointment last Friday. This morning when we appeared early they were ready for us and took our vehicle right in. Fast and professional they did all the work requested , pointed out a few things that will need to be done in the future, and clearly fix our Roadtrek. No upselling no surprise on price, nothing but very fine work at a reasonable price. If we lived in the area this would be our go to repair place for sure"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"They charged me $65.21 for a simple oil change and an oil change. When I got home, the tire pressure light came on. I called and they said they didn't have time to look at it and they would be right in. When I got there, they said they would have to take a look at it.

Automotive,3.0,CG,"I took my daughters 2013 Mercedes GLK 350 to him for its first service. I was told by a Mercedes mechanic that the front struts needed to be replaced, so he should be able to do it in the next few days. The shop told me that the struts would need to be replaced. I was also told that they would need to be replaced by Mercedes. I asked if he could take a look at it and if he could do"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Wow this place is great!!! We have been coming here for years and have always been pleased with the service.  The prices are reasonable, they have never tried to upsell me, and they are honest and friendly.  I have never had a problem with them and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a quick and efficient service.  I will definitely be coming back!I brought my car in for an oil change and it was done"
Automotive,3.5,CG,Had an opportunity to use this place and thought it would be a good place for a quick wash. I had a coupon for a free wash for $19. 95 and it was worth it. It was a little pricey for a car wash and for a basic wash. I was in and out within the hour. They also offer a lifetime warranty. I went there with a coupon for $15.
Automotive,4.0,CG,"After a week and a half later, the oil light came on. I called the dealership and they said that they had to replace the valve cover gasket and the cover gasket. The dealership said that they would be able to replace the gasket but I had to replace the gasket myself. I called the dealership and they said that they would call me back. After a week, I called again and they said that they would not get to"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"These guys have helped me out a lot with my car issues.  They have been very helpful and knowledgeable.  

I've also used them for oil changes and inspections and they are always extremely friendly and efficient.  

They have always been very honest and have been able to explain things to me and explain things to me.  They are very reasonable and they will even do a few things to make sure my car is running"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"My sister bought a car here a couple years ago. I will say that the sales person, John, was great. The sales manager, John, was very nice. The sales manager, Mark, was great. He listened to my needs and wants. I felt like I had been treated fairly. I will continue to do business with them and I will recommend them to others.I will never buy a car from here again. I bought my car"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Horrible customer service at the Tampa airport.  We arrived at the airport at 8:30 pm.  Upon arrival the driver told us that they would have to ""turn it in"" to go to the airport.  We waited 3 minutes for them to come to us.  The driver said it would take a few minutes and it would take about an hour to get to us.  I was shocked.  I asked the driver if they"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"If you're looking for an honest mechanic, go to these guys. 

The guys here are knowledgeable and have the best prices in town. 

I'm a fan and will go to them again. 

I will be back!I had a great experience at this location.  I was helped by Andrew, the manager, and Eric.  They were all very nice and professional.  I highly recommend this location."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"It's always interesting reviewing car shops. The guys here are knowledgeable, friendly, and the prices are fair. If you want to get your car fixed right the first time, take it to these guys. I'll be back. I will recommend them to all my friends and family. I would give a zero if I could. I went in to get a simple tire fix and they told me my tire had to be replaced."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"This Jag -Land Rover dealership, has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I went in to get an oil change and the guy at the counter said ""Oh you can bring it in today"" and hung up. I'm not sure why I would come here to get an oil change and a tire rotation. I will never go back and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place. This place is awesome."
Automotive,2.5,CG,I took my vehicle here for an inspection and oil change.  The staff were very friendly and professional.  The waiting area was comfortable and they had a nice selection of drinks and snacks.  They had a vending machine for a few minutes.  I appreciated that they offered a vending machine and a free coffee or soda.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good mechanic.  I will be back for my next oil change
Automotive,2.5,OR,I have bought several cars here over the years.  They are always upfront and pleasant.  Nothing to say but good things about sales or service.  If you have a problem go see one of the managers.  They are all very helpful and have always solved any issues I have had.  If that doesn't work go in and ask for the owner.  He works there every day and is a very nice man.  You would be hard pressed to find a better car dealership!
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Great bunch of guys really friendly and awesome prices. Bought a quarter panel for half the price and they removed it off the car. The guy who pulled the part was very friendly they walk you out to the vehicle make sure the part looks good to you and then They remove it for you. The  price was really great. They truly charged me half the price of pick n pull and they removed the part unlike  pick n pull, you have to do the work."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"These guys are super fast and SUPER helpful!! Deshaun, Miguel and Wes are Awesome!! 
Here's the crazy part...

Recently , there was a strange sound coming from my air conditioner and I asked Chris to check it while they changed my oil. Long story short, it was a MOUSE that climbed up into my engine and somehow got chopped into 3 big pieces! 
I'm so thankful that Chris found the cause of the noise without losing his lunch! Lol If you don't believe me ask when you get an oil change!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Only want to take money.  They lie, beat on the cars that are supposed to be fixed, are lazy and do not stand behind their work.  Had an accident in October, get the car back in November.  The car has been back two times already.  The first time for three days; now it's been there over a week.   Making every excuse in the world to blame us for the problems and try to avoid honoring the ""lifetime warranty"".  Stay away from this place!"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"If you are saying the car wash needs help, but they already fix the problem with zip ties. It works super well right now, but they haven't add dryers yet. It still have some dirt issues a little bit, but however than that the car wash is working very normally right. Here's the link to the video taken from Dieselducy. He's a elevator photographer and does elevator filming with her elevator fans like TJ and Jacob, Youtube name: The Elevator Channel. I will link the video right now. Link: https://m. youtube."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This is the best Subaru shop in the Midwest for a reason. They have a longer wait than other shops lately but it is well worth it. I've gotten regular maintenance done here since I got my Subaru and if I ever need repairs or major work done I'm going here. They are honest about what you need or don't need and their prices are very fair for the quality of work you get. Also, Erica (the receptionist) is always very friendly and happy to answer any questions I have."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"We have just purchased a new car a couple of weeks ago from Bill Ellsworth, our salesman. He went out of his way to accommodate our needs and desires. Two weeks later, we came back for a remote start installation and had a great experience with the overall service we received thanks to Anthony Burgess the Service Consultant and Precision Toyota's staff.

We will be looking for a truck soon and will definitely use our salesman Bill again. Thanks you for your service and dedication on taking care of our needs."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I called to ask if I can return a Chrysler owned vehicle off lease here. I was told by someone who identified himself as the GSM that they don't generally do that, which I completely understand. He said that if they did take it back that it's highly likely it will get damaged. He also said their lot is so small they damage vehicles every day. Based on this, I felt it necessary to warn my fellow yelpers, if they buy here they might be buying a damaged vehicle."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"We just moved to the area and my husband found AudioSonic through yelp.  Mike did a fantastic job with installing a new stereo system in a car that we had been told, would be difficult to install. He did a super job and had the job done quickly.  He was extremely thorough in explaining how the new system worked. He even buffed out a few scratches on the car.   We plan on taking our son's Jeep in for some stereo improvements.  I would highly recommend!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,First off I'd like to start by saying the customer service is horrible my boyfriend went in for an front wheel alignment and his car ended up in smoke we waited for 4 hours for a wheel alignment and then next thing you know they pull the car in and it goes up in smoke and not only did they tell us that it happened but they told us 40 minutes after it happened the manager is the worst do not take your car here something we'll go wrong !
Automotive,5.0,OR,"We won't be using this  place for our work since they wanted to charge exactly DOUBLE their normal rate (and incidentally what everyone else charges) to align the front end of a pick up truck. Everyone else we spoke with said the work is the same as any other vehicle. They use the exact same equipment on the truck and still align exactly two wheels, but luckily we avoided being over-charged here. If you have a pick up, you better look for another garage to do your alignment work."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I have been coming here for years and Donald is the best.  He is very honest and fair, and if he can't get me in and out fast, he lets me know so I can plan a ride, but he nearly always is able to help me very quickly.  I've had my tires patched and rotated and had my catalytic converter replaced after it was cut out in the middle of the night.  Sometimes he is busier than others, I try to go mid-week if I can."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Very very rude. very expensive.
I asked for the receipt and they said it was for a small fee and we will get it fixed. I asked for the receipt and was told the same thing. The manager came over and said we need to get it fixed. I said why didn't you have the receipt? He said he doesn't know. I said I don't know. He said we will get it fixed. I said I can't"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"I bought my Infiniti GX35 here a couple years ago. I will say that I have been pretty impressed with the service and the people there.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The waiting room is comfortable and clean.   The shop is well kept and the waiting room is also clean.  

I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle.I just went there to have my car serv"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Met some nice people there, and helped me with my car. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a woman and have a credit score of 4. 5%. They had me in and out in less than 2 hours. I will be back. I would give a zero if I could. I went in to get a simple tire repair and they told me my tire had to be replaced."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"Thank you so much Jamie!!
I will definitely be back!I've been going to this car wash for years.  Every time I've been there they have been extremely friendly and helpful.  The only thing I can say about this place is they have some special special car washes which are also great.  I have also found it very convenient and I've been to a few car washes where I can get the same service as if I"
Automotive,4.0,CG,My experience at Lexus of Tampa Bay was the best. I will definitely be buying my next vehicle from them. Great job!I am a very loyal customer of this dealership. I purchased a used car from this dealership in April 2017. The car was not ready for my son's birthday. We were told it was ready to go. The salesman told us it would be ready by the end of the week. When I got there it was still dirty
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Tow driver just almost ran into me and started screaming at me. 

The tow truck driver is so rude and the driver is a complete jerk. He is a total jerk and he is a complete jerk. 

I will never ever use this company again.

They are a complete rip off. I will never ever use them again. I will never use them again. I will be telling everyone I know not to use them"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"I highly recommend Vico's Auto Repair. The guys here are knowledgeable, friendly, and the work they do is so affordable. The people there are also very knowledgeable and honest. They do a great job and I would highly recommend them to anyone.I wish I could give negative stars. I bought a vehicle from them a few years back and I had a horrible experience with the sales team. They didn't have the vehicle I wanted, but they offered"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I will never go to this dealership again.Went in to get my tire patched and the guy who helped me was a nice guy. He said the tires were in great shape and that it was a little pricey. I said no problem. He then said ""It's cheaper than the other place. You have to come back in a few hours."" I said no thanks and said I'll just come back later. I was there for two hours."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Great car wash!  This is a family owned business.  My car was just as dirty as when I bought it.  I will definitely be back!I bought a used car from this dealership.  It was in good shape, but it was not very clean.  The car was not a good fit for the price I paid.  The salesman was very nice and helpful.  I was very disappointed with the car I bought and the salesman"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"OK. I admit I was upset because I thought the car was in great shape, but I'm not a fan. 

When I took the car back, the mechanic told me that it was a little overpriced, which was a little more than I expected. I brought the car back a few days later to get it looked at and told them it was a little overpriced. They just charged me $200 to look at the car,"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Go elsewhere. For 3 years, I have bought two cars from them. On my last visit, I had an oil change done. The guys at the front desk were nice, professional and nice. They had me in and out in a matter of 15 minutes. I was in and out in no time. I will definitely be back.I had a horrible experience with the sales team at this dealership.  I purchased a car from them and they did"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"Sam was a great help and helped me with my car issues.  He really took the time to explain everything and helped me get a great deal on the car.  The sales manager was very nice and personable.  I would recommend him to anyone looking for a new or used car.  Great place to buy a car.I had a very good experience at this dealership. They were very professional, courteous, and made sure my needs"
Automotive,2.5,CG,I should have just gone somewhere else and let them do what they did for me. I'm not a mechanic but I've never experienced such poor customer service. This place is a joke. The customer service is great. I came in for an oil change and to check on my battery. The guy was friendly and did not try to sell me on anything I didn't need. I went there to have my car serviced.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Plaza Lexus Service couldn't be worse. Will move to Mungenast. Agree with most of the negative comments here. They don't seem to hire the same level professionals they hire in the Mercedes and Audi bays. Lexus is a great car but if Plaza Lexus was the only service shop in town, Lexus would be in trouble. Will go to Plaza for the free car washes but any time we need to spend even $25 we will go to Mungenast. No time for rude employees and yes filthy restrooms and kitchen area."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My girlfriend and I normally have a decent experience at Thoroughbred. Today was awful. Beginning the experience, EVERY receptionist was not wearing a mask, customers were not mandated to wear a mask, and there was no sanitization process whatsoever. When we spoke to a salesman, he spoke to myself and my girlfriend in a very demeaning tone when we didn't want to spend more money on thing we simply didn't need. They then brought other cars to work on that arrived after us and left ours without any maintenance on it."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Honestly, I could have done a better job myself. While in the sitting area I saw my car sitting for several minutes, still wet. The longer your car sits like that the more water marks get left behind. So even after they spent time to wipe it dry, it still had water residue drips all over. I will say that they did a great job getting my tires and rims to look nice and clean. But all in all, not worth $30. Wish I hadn't tipped because they were not worthy."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"This is probably the worst place to get an oil change. Yeah it might be cheap, but the customer service is kaka. I went there once to get a $18.95 oil change and got charged $250 after the fact. When I went in to find out why this happened the manager said they missed typed the number, which seemed odd since it was literally 12x the price that was advertised. The manager was rude in refunding me. Would rather pay a little more than to deal with this company every again!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"This place is full of crooks. I had an issue with my Ford Edge abs and traction control.  Took it in to have it looked at since we bought it there.  Wanted $260 to repair since warranty had expired.  I decided to decline and check it out myself.   Turns out there was a $0,05 cent screw missing and I replaced with one I had laying around.  No cost and no problem 3 months later.  DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE!!!!!!   Ever!!!  Awful!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Brought my Odyssey in for service and a warranty repair.  My service advisor was Scott.  I explained very specifically what was needed to be done based on previous diagnosis (a very common repair that is covered by a honda service bulletin).  i left the car overnight and for most of the day.  They did the maintenance service but were once again did not have the parts to complete the repair.  Additionally, they did not wash/vacuum the car as they usually do and say that they do."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I've taken my car here twice. My girlfriend has gone once. Never a hassle, always honest and affordable. Most recently there was an ongoing scraping sound under my car. I took it to Lawson and they found a rock of some sort lodged underneath near the tires or breaks.. can't remember. They said no charge. So despite this small fix, they gave me their time and honesty at no cost. And they were incredibly busy, yet not annoyed that I took up some of their time. Please take your vehicle here."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I found CarSmart through Groupon, and I am so glad I did! Everyone was extremely friendly. I had my car in for an oil change, and they reminded me that my tires were essentially bald (57,000 miles on them!). They quoted me a very fair price to replace all 4 tires, so I had them do that as well. They also offered a shuttle to and from my office, which made my appointment very convenient. I will absolutely be coming back to CarSmart for oil changes and service for my car!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Joey C goes above and beyond for every customer and has the best service around. He not only makes your car look as good as new, but he provides the service with a smile on his face and comforting words when you just had a horrible day with your car (whether it be an accident, flat tire etc). It's not everyday you find an HONEST and RELIABLE collision company. I've never been so thankful to have found Joey C & his company, I will never trust anyone else with my car."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I brought my car in for its scheduled 10,000 mile service. While this isn't where I purchased my car, I will likely buy my next one here. Aside from the polished marble floors, big screen tv and complimentary goodies in the waiting area, Bryan Fernandez offered top notch customer service. He directed me to online coupons, scoring me $100 off on the small repairs and service I needed. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my service experience here and would definitely recommend MB of Wesley Chapel."
Automotive,4.0,OR,Always skeptical about these places HOWEVER this is my second time using them ( I travel weekly and I hate to inconvenience ppl to p/m/u ) They are prompt courteous and get me to the airport timely. In addition when picking you up from your return flight they are there within 10 minutes so no waiting to get to your car. Easy to access all main roads to get home. I will definitely continue to use them as long as long as I don't have a ride from family or friends.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Great fast service. They're always available to fit you in same day or next day. Plus! Super nice owner!
My latest trip I went in for an inspection. My boyfriend went to pick up my car and was shocked by the price. Apparently they changed my oil as well. He kind of balked at that because I did just have my oil changed, they just didn't update the sticker. 
The owner was so nice and took off the cost of the oil change without even asking. I thought that was really impressive!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I had originally posted 5 stars with this dealership. Now, having sat in waiting room for my service, I'm dropping it to 3. Now going on an hour and a half.

1:45... and why the heck do they need adjust my seat? Arrrggghhh


This is by far one of the best dealerships I've encountered. The staff is incredibly helpful and courteous. They have so far gone above and beyond to assist me with my Tacoma, which I didn't even buy from them. I will definitely bring my business to them in the future."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"I've purchased 32 cars in my life and the experience has been nothing but excellent. I have purchased 3 cars from Bommarito, both from Cactus and Volvo.

They were quick and efficient. I will definitely be back.I came here for an oil change and tire rotation. I had a tire emergency with a nail in it. They helped me out with a patch and got me back on the road quickly. I was happy to have found this

The staff is friendly and helpful.I have been going to this location for years and have always had excellent service.  I have had several issues with my vehicle and have always been pleased with the service.  They are very professional and take great care of their customers.  I have referred many friends and family members
Automotive,5.0,CG,Tye was super responsive. I had an appointment with him and he came back with a quote and he gave me an estimate. The work was done in less than an hour. The price was very reasonable and I would highly recommend this business. I had an appointment with Mike to replace a window regulator and a tire. I was greeted immediately and told the car was ready to go. I was told it would take about an hour to do the job.
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Dont. whatever you do, stay away!!The owner and the owner are very rude and unprofessional. I just wanted to get an oil change and a tire rotation and the manager told me it would take about an hour and a half. I waited 3 hours for them to complete my oil change and tire rotation and it took them 3 hours to complete the oil change. I had to wait 3 hours for a tire rotation and tire rotation."

I highly recommend this dealership."

I chose the quote above because it's hard to find a good mechanic these days and a place with 5 stars on Yelp... really? Can it be?!? Yes, my friends, it can be-- and it IS! 30th person to review General Transmission and this is my 471st review. 

Thank you to this team who took care of my family, was very quick, straight up and honest, well priced and seem to genuinely care about their customers. 

I highly recommend General Transmission in Reno."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"this was the first time I had the oil in my vehicle changed by anyone other than a Dodge dealership and I had an A1 experience here at Take 5. the technician who helped me today, Alonzo, was super nice and welcoming and thanked me extensively for choosing Take 5. Alonzo went over all of my oil options and offered other services in a way that wasn't pushy, so I don't know what all those few ""pushy salesman"" reviews are about. but yeah man, A+. I'll be back in five thousand miles."
Automotive,2.5,OR,I only went to this location to pick up a auto part for a repair. I found them to have what I needed at the best price. I actually called to verify the availability and cost prior to driving over.  Only to learn the in store and online price had a difference of over $100. I sure would like to know WHY? I paid the lesser price online they also charged $1 for in store pick. It was a quick easy in store transaction the employees I interacted with were pleasant.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"The day before leaving town to attend a wedding, I noticed my brakes felt squishy. I had no hopes of getting my car serviced same day and repaired in time for our trip. I called Midas and Danny said he would make it happen. He did! He discovered that my brakes were in a dangerous condition. He replaced all pads and rotors, plus did an oil change. My car was ready first thing the next morning. We made our trip without any worries. I would recommend this location to everyone."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I went to Dynamic Diesel not knowing what I would find.  I needed some pretty extensive work done on my Dodge diesel.
I was overwhelmed by the friendliness and professional that greeted me.
Bryan was the person I dealt with.  He took the time to explain what they were going to do to my truck.  They had more problems than they figured on, so Bryan called me and explained the situation.  Very professional.
The work they performed was over and above what I expected.
Thank you Dynamic Diesel for a great job."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I visited this booth at the boat show and I cannot begin to tell you how appalled I was at the behavior of the woman working for the company. She spoke to the customers, including myself, like we were pre schoolers. Reprimanding us as if we were 3 year old because we walked on a boat (that was not roped off or closed in any way) at 4:15 when the boat show did not even end until 5pm. I'm actually beside myself that this woman has a job working with the public."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I recently moved to MO and my car needed serviced. I was able to make an appointment online really easy and could get in the next day. Most places book up quickly and you sometimes can't get an appointment until a few weeks out. I had my oil changed, 24,000 mile service performed, and had the emissions and VIN number verified. It took about 2 hours total and the customer service was great. They had a nice waiting area with a large TV and free coffee. I will definitely go back again."

When we got there, the manager told us that they would get back to us in an hour. We waited for about an hour and a half. The manager said they would call us back within the hour.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"I took my car in to get my brakes checked. They told me that my rotors THRASHED and my brake pads were GARBAGE and said I needed to replace all four rotors and all four brake pads. They wanted to charge me $700 for parts and labor. I got a second opinion, and a third, and both of them said my brakes and rotors were FINE. They cleaned off the rotors and brakes and everything has been smooth since then. 

Firestone tried to scam me into a $700 purchase that was completely UNNECESSARY."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Tucson Volkswagen did an awesome job helping us find a car to find our needs AND budget.  My husband called prior to arriving at the dealership and spoke with Eric Gulbrandsen who stated that he would take the vehicle out for us and have it ready for a test drive.  Sure enough, when we got there it was waiting for us.  The whole experience was very positive, low pressure, helpful, and friendly. I would recommend this dealership and Eric to anyone looking to deal with a honest, up front salesman."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Scam artists!! Bought a Buick riviera with a 3 day like it and return it policy. Was not happy with the car and decided to return it the next day . Called and asked what is the process in returning it and the salesman told me to bring it in when so and so will be here  . Brought the car in on that day and the salesperson or manager told me it was past the 3 day like it policy. So these people are scum bags and prey on trusting people.
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Worst ever. I lease 2 vehicles from this from Brandon Hyundai. The service was always bad. They told me my windshield wipers melted and I had to buy new ones. REALLY? Melted? And that's my fault? 
And when I turned in my lease car, they charged me for a worn steering wheel. $261.00 for a worn steering wheel. I just drove the car. How is that my fault?  Isn't that normal wear and tear? Or maybe a manufacturing defect. But it certainly isn't my fault. 
I will never deal with them again."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Where's the 6th star? Whatever I write here, it is not good enough for these guys. My vehicle was t-boned, my first major accident, and every bit of stress, confusion & worry I had was instantly taken care of with a smile. They go above and beyond, communicating while my insurance company was not, and even taking care of a dent in the car I rented. I pick my  baby up soon & I'll have some pics of their work, but so far blown away. Your car will be in great hands!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,I just bought my first car there and they were very informative on all my options and worked with me so that I would be able to buy my new car. There was no pressure to buy from them. The salesperson just wanted me to be informed of my options. A few days later they also checked up on me to see if I liked my new car and if had any problems that they could fix. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family if they're looking for a new car.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"This the BEST dealership! The customer service is impeccable starting from the beginning. I love the free car washes and take full advantage of it. Beautiful showroom ,clean bathrooms and well stocked concierge area. Every single staff member is always so pleasant and happy to serve you. Christian in the service area was so nice to work with, he went above and beyond my expectations of customer service......A+++++ to Lexus because they must treat there employees right, it def shows. What a great company and a great car! I'm a customer for life"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I just bought my Jeep Grand Cherokee and absolutely love it. Michael Ginyard is one of the most knowledgeable salesmen that I have come across when it comes to Jeep vehicles. He was very patient as we contemplated the purchase and I would definitely recommend him to anyone that is looking for a car. We came in looking for a specific vehicle and ended up leaving with what I wanted. There was no need to even test drive it. After the sale, the jeep drove like a dream. Thank you Mike for everything!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,My experience with this company was outstanding ! I was an unfortunate that had my catalytic converter stolen by a thief overnight and I drove (very loudly) to the shop from a recommendation from my mechanic. I arrived at about 8:30 AM and was fixed and on my way by 10:00. The shop owner did apologize because the shop is being remodeled and was attentive and empathetic to my situation. Price was reasonable for the amount of work that had to get done. Thank you Staff and Management at Low Cost Exhaust !!!
Automotive,2.0,CG,STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!Had an amazing experience at this dealership.  Sales person was awesome and we worked with him.  I will definitely be back!I bought a used car from this dealership and had it serviced at a different dealership. I had a problem with the car that I had a 2 year old car and it had a major problem. They told me they would take care of it but I never got a call from
Automotive,4.0,CG,"This was my first time here. The guys were friendly and professional. They were very thorough and thorough. The oil change was quick, and they also provided a military discount. I will definitely go back. 

Thank you, guys!I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely helpful and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to get my car serviced. I will recommend them to anyone I know!I recently purchased a brand new"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"I wash my car nearly every week and the dryer is always nice and the car is always clean. 

If you want a good wash, you can't beat it. The only thing I can say is if you want to use the vacuum service, it's cheaper than the other place. I have to do it myself, but I will not be getting my car washed here again.This place is awesome.  I went in for a brake job,"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"5 stars for a carwash?!?!?!

We decided to purchase a new car and were pretty nervous about the whole thing. We went to the dealership to discuss the price of the car and it was a little higher than the sticker price. We told the salesperson that we would be going to a dealer closer to us and he said ""I'll call you back"". We waited another 10 minutes and went to the finance office to discuss the price."
Automotive,1.5,CG,This company is the worst.  The owner is a jerk and will make you uncomfortable.  The owner is not the best.  He is the worst.  He is very rude and unprofessional.  It will cost you a lot of money if you don't want to have the vehicle towed.  I have the most common complaint about how the mechanic is a jerk.  I have never had a problem with him.  The only reason I gave a 1
Automotive,3.5,CG,I've come here a couple of times and they've always been very polite and efficient. I just recently had an oil change and I was out in less than 30 minutes. They were quick and efficient. I'll be back. I will be coming here again and will recommend them to everyone I know.I had a great experience purchasing a car from here. They were very patient and helpful. I was able to get the car I wanted and they even let me test
Automotive,3.5,CG,"We had the best experience here. The guys were friendly and professional. They were very thorough and thorough. The oil change was quick, and they also provided a military discount. I will definitely go back. 

Thank you, guys!I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely helpful and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to get my car serviced. I will recommend them to anyone I know!I recently purchased a brand new"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"When I lived in Old City, I thought I'd take it back to him. He said he'd get back to me.

He called me back a few days later and said it was ready and he'd be in touch with me. I called him back within a couple of hours and he said he was going to get back to me the next day. He called me back a few days later to say it was ready and they didn't charge me anything"
Automotive,1.5,CG,The worst auto transport company. We have been using them for years and have never had a problem. They do not have the best customer service. We have had our vehicles for 4 years now and have had no issues. We will continue to use them and will continue to use them. They are honest and reliable and I will continue to use them for all our auto needs. We bought a used Subaru Outback from them last week.
Automotive,4.0,CG,I highly recommend Doctor Dan's!!I have been going to this car wash for years. I have never had a problem.  The staff is always friendly and the car wash does a great job.  They offer a lifetime wash if you want to use it.  The staff are very knowledgeable and always a pleasure to deal with.  I have had many experiences with other car washes in the area and this one has been the best.  The customer service is
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Just left Park's Car Wash. 

I paid $18.95 for a full detail and the interior was not cleaned. I asked for the interior to be vacuumed and it was not. The floor mats were not even touched. The floor mats were not vacuumed. The carpet was not wiped. The interior was not cleaned. The floor mats were not wiped at all. They left dust on the dash and the floor mats. The mats were not wiped"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"I know that they are not an easy dealership to deal with but they make it a point to make sure that you are comfortable with your purchase and then have you sign the contract.I have been going to this location for years and have always had excellent service.  I have had several issues with my car and they have always been very accommodating and helpful.  I have never had any problems with my car, but I have used it for two years now and will continue"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Went to the parts desk today 5/8/21.  A shorter chubby guy told me to go outside to get the vin from my truck.  When I came back in I was now 3rd in line.  I was speaking to another customer about it when the counter guy said ""I don't need to hear all that"".  I told him I wasn't speaking to him and he said ""do you want to take this outside?""  I took my business elsewhere but never had that happen once in my 63 yrs.  Unbelievable."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Wonderful service! My husband and I got a flat tire a few blocks away from their location but didn't have the money for a new tire until pay day. We had a spare but no tools to get the flat tire off. We nursed the car to tire discounters and they took off the tire and put on the spare for free! As we were leaving, we realized that we had walked into the office 1 minute before close, and they still didn't turn us away. This location sure does hire good, compassionate people."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I recently had my vehicle serviced here. The individuals I worked with were courteous and professional. There was a mix up with my vehicle and another clients, they started performing the work without my okay because they had confused the two of us. Perhaps a little extra care or a change in the process will prevent this in the future. Overall the experience was great and they gave a discount for the mix up. I agree that these guys are honest and aren't looking to charge you for items you don't need."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I purchased and take my Land Rover here for service and always have had a great experience. When purchasing my vehicle I did not feel pressured and getting service has always been relatively easy. Each time I had a long wait, I was always offered a loaner. I love the VIP treatment and the concierge service for pick up and drop off so it's not a major hassle out of my day. I travel about 45 minutes to use their service and it's well worth it! Cheers to you cruising in your luxury ride!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I have been here 3 times for service on my old classic Tahoe, every time they have been accommodating and competitive. Even on tire prices. 

Case in point, I show up on a Saturday at 8AM no appointment on a Holiday weekend. Can I help you? Yes can I get my oil changed, sure we can get you in, do you have an hour? 

They know what it means to treat customers well. When it comes time for my classic Tahoe to move on I will come here to shop for my next Chevy."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Had a car towed by the at 1 am and called about 15 times to no response. when i show up the lady at the front desk started off with an attitude then insulted the car before I even paid. She was beyond rude and ignorant during the conversation and i have never been disrespected by an auto shop like this before. I will never have my car worked on here and definitely do NOT recommend going here if your looking to not get ripped off and be treated like a normal human being.
Automotive,3.0,OR,Left a voicemail in the morning. That evening I made a website request for assistance. The next day I get a call back from the internet request (not from the voicemail) When I explained that my husband is 9 hours away from home and needed RV repair assistance I was told that their service department is too busy to help non-customers; so because we didn't buy our trailer from them they were not willing to help us. Poor customer service in my book. Not even a referral to another company in the area.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I bring my car here about once a month encrusted with bugs on the outside and covered in dog hair inside.  I get the #4 Signature Elite ($32.99 - not including gratuity for the poor soul that pulls the short straw on my car).  

It comes out shiny and new looking every time.  The staff is really friendly and they recognize when you are a repeat customer.  

My only complaint is how far I have to drive to get there, but Spa is definitely worth going out of your way."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Fantastic service, honest mechanics, and an overall great experience - I could not recommend this place more highly. I originally took my car to a different mechanic and was told it would need thousands of dollars in repairs or it would not pass inspection (which I knew was bs). I then took the car to Wayne's and it turned out that all it needed to pass inspection was a new set of wiper blades. They also did necessary maintenance (new air filter, oil change, etc.), which was very reasonably priced. Thank you, Wayne's Garage!!!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I could have taken my car anywhere to get repaired because the other persons insurance company was paying for the repairs, I got a few recommendations from people but my one friend said bring it to philly auto body and you won't regret it. I'm so glad I took my friends recommendation, they did an awesome job!! The car really does look better than when I bought it! Ed did a great job keeping me in the loop and working with the insurance company! I will definitely be recommending others to philly auto body!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I have been taking our fleet of passenger vans and personal vehicles to Jammin' J's for quite a few years, and can honestly say that is 28 years of fleet management I have never been more satisfied with the service and attention I receive, every time. Doug and his wife, along with Dave, John, and others run a tight ship, providing up-to-date auto tech service at a fair price. They have always been honest with me, and while not the low bidder, I have never had to return a job. Give 'em a try!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"AMAZING service. Franklin Specialist has never let us down.  Dan, who we interact with the most,  goes above and beyond for his customers. All the workers are very nice. After many years of not trusting a mechanic shop, I feel safe knowing they're doing their best to get us in and to fix the problem. I have two children under two, and I'm hoping my 2004 Infiniti G35 will last just a few more years and am confident FS can make it happen.  10/10 will always be taking my Infiniti here."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"This is the worst car dealership I have ever dealt with.  I purchased a car from them.  The sales people are nice, but the service department is not the same as other dealers.  I have been in the market for a new car for several weeks and they have not even started working on it yet.  I will not be buying another car from them.I got a flat tire and had to take it to my mechanic.  I called a few other"
Automotive,2.5,CG,Drove over from Tampa for a quick oil change and they did a great job. I was in and out within an hour and I was out within an hour. Thanks so much guys!I had a great experience with this place.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The staff was very helpful.  They were able to answer all my questions and concerns with my car.  They even took time to look at my car and show me what was wrong with it
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Purchased a F-350 from them. 

I had a good experience.  The sales person, Mike, was great.  I liked him and he seemed to care about what I wanted to spend.  

The next day, I drove around with my two young kids in the vehicle.  I was amazed at how clean the vehicle was and it was a clean car.  I was surprised to see the car was still dirty. "
Automotive,5.0,CG,George the owner worked around my schedule and was very professional. The mechanic said he would get back to me the next day and then the next day when he was finished he called to let me know that the work was completed. I appreciated his honesty and would definitely recommend him to others. I will definitely be back!I had to wait 3 months for a part to come in to install a part that was on my order.
Automotive,4.5,CG,We just purchased a new vehicle and the experience was great.  We had a very positive experience.  The sales people were very friendly and took the time to explain the features and go over the car.  It was a very pleasant experience.  My sales associate was John and he was great.  He was also very professional and knowledgeable about the vehicle and the features.  He made it very easy to get the car I wanted and go over everything with me. 
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Went back in March to look at the car and decided to purchase. When I got there the salesman (I am the best) acted like he didn't care about me. I was so angry and told him I was just going to look at the car and see if it would be ready for a test drive. He continued to say ""I don't know"". I asked if he could test drive the car and he said ""no"" and walked away."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"We purchased a new rv here last year. We had a great experience with the sales person, Andrew. He was very helpful, informative and knowledgeable. He worked with us on price and financing. We worked with him on a price on a car. He was very knowledgeable and knowledgeable. We felt comfortable working with him and Andrew. We had a great experience with the sales manager, Eddie. He went above and beyond to make sure we got what we wanted."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Gas station convenient location. Clean, fast, and very friendly.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a woman and have a credit card. I used to go to a car wash in the past, but it's not worth the time.

They always have a good selection of gas and are always busy. However, I think they're all very nice. It's a small gas station and the gas prices are reasonable.
"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"I drive a 2009 Honda Accord with 55k miles. I also have my own mechanic and he is a very nice guy. I am a very loyal customer and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. 

Thank youI came here for an oil change and tire rotation. I had a tire emergency with a nail in it. They told me it would take about 30-45 minutes. I had to leave my car there for two hours because it was late in"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Called to schedule for window tinting and they said they would be able to install the window and we would be in the next day.  

I showed up at 4:30 and was told it would be ready in a half hour.  I waited for two hours for the tint to be done.  I was also told the car was not ready for pick up.  I was told the tint was not ready and that they would be with me when"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Samantha, my service advisor, was very helpful and pleasant.  He also helped me find the exact vehicle I wanted and had the best price for me.  The car was in great shape and I couldn't be happier with the results.  The whole experience was very easy and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a new vehicle.I had a very good experience at this dealership. They were very professional, courteous, and made sure my needs"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Tim and his mechanics immediately gave me the sense I was in good hands. The initial issue was stumping them and they gave me the option of trying a used but working part to see how my Volvo reacted and it solved the problem! Tim gave me a very good price for the used part. (Update: Still working almost a year later!) 
Their general diagnostics was thorough with timely estimates of when things needed attention by. Nothing over the top or unnecessary. Tim is friendly, honest, knowledgeable and communicates very simply and direct. No b. s."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I got my Subaru WRX bumper re-painted and I still saw all the marks on it when I brought it in. I smelled paint when I picked it up but it was at night from a dorp off and couldn't see it up close. Then when I did, it looked just the same as when I borught it in. I went back there to tell them about it and got some story I didnt believe. 

I will never go there again...Lots of other better places for detailing or other work.

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I never expected to received service like this, I was stranded two hours away from home at my place of work and contact Richard after three other mechanic calls. He offered to come to the location, after his shop hours, where I was to look at the car since it was not drive-able. He was able to get my car in gear so I could drive it home to my mechanic. I now have his number in my phone and will call him again should I ever need a mechanic when in Chadds Ford, PA."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Buyer beware. They like to up charge and suggest things need to be repaired that do not. I had new front Brakes and rotors replaced by a different shop less than 10,000 miles ago (less than 1 year).  Came in here to have the rear rotors and brakes replaced and during their 'free' car inspection they said I also needed new front rotors as well despite them working fine and fairly new.  Also suggested I needed a new air filter however that was only a few months old as well.  Buyer beware."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I recently moved to PA and was in need of a shop that could complete a State Inspection for me. Having read the other positive reviews about Fulmer's I decided to give them a try.  I was extremely happy with how professional, fast and economical the entire process was.  I spoke to the owner who founded the garage in 1975 and was impressed by his commitment to providing honest and reliable service.  This is a garage I will undoubtedly return to in the future.  I am happy to have found them!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"If you like standing around in the Reno DMV for hours, catching the flu from the huddled masses, then avoid going to Hutch's Quik Smog at all costs. If you want a ten minute in and out friendly one stop place to get smogged and all your DMV Registration stuff done, without the need for antibiotics, then this is your go-to spot in South Reno. Josh has taken care of me two years in a row, and is gonna be seeing me every year to come. If you aren't going here, you're wrong."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Had my brakes replaced through these guys and a week later they failed on the highway. Fortunately I was on an off ramp when it happened that was uphill so I was able to steer the car on to the grass to safety.  They wired the hoses incorrectly causing the brake fluid hose to gash.  The had the nerve of actually telling me how much it would cost to fix the hose instead of offering the service for free.  I don't recommend this service center for anything more than an oil change.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"This review is a shout out to Scott and Mike for the exceptional service they provided last Saturday. It was 4:00 pm, the day before a holiday and these two were able to make sure that AAA was able to have my tire changed and charged only the smiles we gave them. It wasn't the complexity of what they did, but the fact that they made sure the problem was fixed. I've had problems here years ago, but with the attitude of these two, I can see that's a thing of the past. Thanks again."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"My beautiful BMW was recently rear-ended because a woman dropped her lipstick while driving,  and as she went to pick it up, BAM! She smacked my rear good! I asked her to show me the lipstick, and when I saw it I replied, ""That color is really horrible, I would have dropped it too."" She laughed and smiled, and as my neck started hurting, and I got the worst headache ever, I asked her for all information, took some photos, and then called 1-800-my-lawyer-is-going-to-screw-you-good. Anyway, I love this shop! My car looks brand new."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Tesla service came out to my house on a service call and told me that I was close to needing to replace my tires. I went by Telle to see what they had to say. The salesman disagreed, said that I probably have around another year to go. He also showed me how to determine when it's time and mentioned that by the time I need the tires hopefully the prices will have dropped from their current crazy-high. Needless to say I was favorable impressed and I will continue to give Telle my tire business."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I am consistently impressed with this location. The manager (?) Romero is excellent. He is kind, treats me (a little blonde lady who knows little about cars) with the utmost respect, and every time I come in my vehicles are repaired and run perfectly.  They are always honest about what needs to be done and when; even when I know they could prob scam me and sell me a repair I don't need. I will continue to do business here and all my maintenance will be done here as well! Thank you Brake Masters!!"

I will be coming back here for all my car needs."

If you are looking to get a car, don't waste your time with this dealership.  They are a scam.I wish I could give negative stars.  I had a very good experience at the dealership.

Automotive,4.5,CG,"Today I had to get my oil changed and the guy was rude and didn't even know how to do it.  The guy then said that they have a ""good day"" and that it was okay to change my oil in a few minutes.  This is a joke.  I had a coupon and they said I could get a free oil change on my next visit.  I didn't get the coupon and I was pretty upset.  I don't even know how"

I had to have my car serviced on my way to work when
Automotive,1.5,CG,Had my 30K service done here. The guys were friendly and professional. They did a great job.I recently had a bad experience with a car dealership that was not only a rip off but a complete rip off. I spoke with a salesman named Jason. I told him I would not buy a car from them because I was not buying a car from them. I was so upset that I didn't want to purchase a car from them and they told me I would have to
Automotive,3.0,CG,"They make me want to go back and let them know I need to make a purchase. 

I am very happy with my purchase and the car itself. 

I have bought many cars in the past and I am very happy with the service I receive.

They also have a great selection of cars and are very helpful. 

I've also found a good used car dealer to work with. 

I will definitely be back and recommend"
Automotive,5.0,CG,Great business! I stopped in here to get an oil change and they were super friendly! I got an appointment within an hour and they got me in and out quickly. I was in and out in less than an hour. I'm a loyal customer for life and will be back for sure!I was looking to purchase a new vehicle and I had a very positive experience at this dealership.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"When I think of Marino's a lot of words come to mind, but the best one is WOW...I was always reluctant to take my car to the shop because I knew it was always going to be something major and expensive, even if it was just for routine maintenance.  However Dave and his team are not only the best, but they are honest and fair.  His rates are fair, the service is excellence, and they make it happen.  If all my service agents were this good my life would be one of utopia."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"My radiator sprang a leak on Sunday over Labor Day weekend while I was on vacation in St. Pete.  Had to rent a car to get home :(  
I left my car in the Wal Mart parking lot and called Affordable Auto on Tuesday when they opened.  They sent a tow truck picked up the car repaired it in one day!!!  All over the phone after I Fed EX them the keys.  
Bobby was professional and stuck to the quote he gave me on the phone.
Good Job!!! Happy Customer!!!
Robert from Orlando"
Automotive,2.5,OR,Friendly staff either that or he was just bored. Had some bugs still on the front of my car when I came out of the wash but he had given me a towel to spot dry anyway so I got it off. The free vacuum is great! I prefer to wash my own car and not run it through the machine but I couldn't find one of those so I stopped in here. I'll be back good clean car and not damaged. If there was not still bugs on my front they would have 5 stars.
Automotive,1.0,OR,They claim to be willing work with customers due to the current pandemic but will only waive a late fee. I should have read the reviews before refinancing my car with this poorly ran and managed lender. Poor customer service reps don't have a clue and simply tell customers what they want to hear to end the call. Trying to cancel a reoccurring payment has been a nightmare and I will NOT do any business with this lender in the future and recommend others do the same. Another corporation taking advantage of everyday working people's hardships.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Stay away, save yourself serious headaches.

The service dept is awful.  You constantly have to hound them for status of warranty repairs, don't get call backs and as recently as yesterday, the service writers do everything they can to ignore customers that walk in.

I stood in front of 3 of them for over 5 minutes.  1 was on a long winded personal call.  The other was tucking it up with a service tech and the 3rd re-arranged the pile of service tickets on her desk several times, making every effort to avoid eye contact."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Was interested in two trucks they advertised on Facebook and other media outlets for a listed price. After driving both trucks and attempting to purchase one suddenly the price increases $3k and they gave some story about postings online being incorrect.  Oddly enough every car they have listed under 10k is the exact same $9995 price to lure you in then try to screw you at the last minute adding $3k or more in ""fees"" that ARE NOT listed on the site.  If you are paying cash go elsewhere, these guys are shady! AF!!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"This is my new favorite Ford dealer! Alan was excellet when it came to helping me get my vehicle repaired under warranty. They were fast, friendly, and thurough! I have every confidence that when I leave my vehicle will be good as new, and that if for some reason it's not, they'll take care of whatever may come next.  Ellis has assembled a great crew. These guys don't know it but I'm a customer service consultant by trade, and is what customer service is supposed to look like! For that, they get all the stars."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Incredible service-- in a jiffy.  

I went to this Jiffy Lube for an oil change after being turned away at the Firestone across the street.  I'd seen the building on the way in but wasn't sure they were open.  But alas, they were, and the staff was incredibly efficient and pleasant.  Took about 20 minutes (max) and I waited with free coffee and wifi. Price was on par with what I've been charged in other places. Seriously, the staff was so NICE! 

They even vacuumed my floor mats for me! Seriously awesome."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"The guys here were great. Its sad to see they have a bad rating. I went in told them where I was at. Rich was my salesman, he took a lot of the stress of looking at the cars a way, with a great sense of humor and fun personality. Everyone there was nice and helpful. I took my 21month daughter with me and they loved her! Helped me find a vehicle that would suit my needs and I can afford. It was a wonderful experience and I would defiantly recommend then to friends and family."
Automotive,2.5,OR,I brought my daughter that just graduated to just look at cars to get an idea. Well the car salesman was great and we found her dream car. I wasn't planning on buying that day or spending that much but the manager gave me a great deal. Everyone at the dealership was wonderful and we left with the car that same day. I also bought my car here and they have one of the best service departments of any dealership. It's one of the main reasons we went to look there. I can't recommend them enough!!
Automotive,4.5,CG,These guys are great!  They have been servicing my car for a long time and I have never had a problem.  The people are always friendly and the service is fast.  They are honest and take great care of their customers.  They are also very friendly and they are not afraid to take advantage of a woman!  I would recommend them to anyone who needs tires!I will never use this location again. I used to go to a different location and when I got
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Mike's automotive is the closest shop to my house and they are always polite and professional. I recommend them to all of my friends. I went to get a car wash and it was pretty bad. They had no clue what they were doing. I told the gentleman who helped me and he said ""oh no problem"". I will go somewhere else. I have been to a lot of car washes in town, but I have to say that they do a great job."
Automotive,2.5,CG,I took my truck to this place because the oil light was on. They said the mechanic said the light was on and it would be $600 to replace. I took it to another shop and they told me the light was on. They also told me I needed to replace the transmission. They gave me a $500 estimate and I paid the $600. I went back to the dealership and was told the light was on. I asked if they could replace the transmission since I'm

The next day I went to get my car and the oil was changed and my car was done within the hour. I had to wait on my car so I could get home. I will definitely be back.We recently purchased a new Audi A4 from this dealership"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Let me start by saying that I have never had a good experience at this dealership. I just purchased a vehicle and had a great experience.  The sales manager, John, was great. He was extremely friendly and helped me find a vehicle that I would like to purchase. The financing department was a bit confusing with the paperwork and I had to be up front with the sales manager. They didn't seem to care and I was pretty upset.  I ended up purchasing a new car"
Automotive,3.5,CG,Bought my Prius here two years ago and the experience was good.  Sales person was nice and we worked hard.  The sales manager was also very helpful and worked hard to get me the best deal possible.  I would definitely buy from them again.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used car.  I had a very good experience with them and will continue to do so.  I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Great place! I found a few things I needed done in the area and they were very accommodating and quick. I had a coupon for a oil change and inspection, so I decided to give it a try. I was very pleased with the service and the staff. The guys were extremely friendly and explained things to me and made me feel comfortable while I was waiting. They made me feel comfortable and comfortable. I was happy to have found this place."

if You value Your time, money, and car,...give them a call."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I am really happy that I found this company. Had to fly out of Tampa for a conference and needed a place to park without paying high airport prices.

The online reservation system was easy to use. The agent at the front desk (even at 3AM in the morning) was kind and friendly. The shuttle driver was also very welcoming and even offered to carry my bags. 

When I came back, the shuttle was sitting there waiting for me at the shuttle stop at Tampa.

Overall, it was an excellent experience. I'll make sure to use their services again."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I had a screw in my tire.  I pulled up to Mavis Tires and Kareem assisted me and evaluated the screw and determined that my tire was leaking air.  I told him that I had to go to work in an hour and he said he would take care of it, right away and patch it.  I went inside, to wait and the staff was kind and courteous.   Kareem had it fixed and me on my way within half an hour.  I would recommend Mavis for all of your tire needs."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Mike is a friendly honest guy who exceeds your expectations when it comes to car repair. He has a small shop with several mechanics working for him and can handle any repair you may need. 

I recently had the local Chrysler Dealer estimate a repair job at $1300 which seemed a bit high. I found Mike thru Cars.com and he estimated the job at $650. two days later the car was done. He had to replace a broken engine mount so the bill was a bit higher but  I save a bundle on the job.

Highly recommended."
Automotive,3.0,OR,Recently moved here from Chicago and needed a hand car wash for newer car.  Based on the positive reviews and convenient location I decided to give this place a try.  I was not disappointed.  I pulled in and was greeted promptly.  Very friendly place with comfortable waiting room.  I sat outside in the shade on a bench which was also pleasant.  Great attention to detail - my car was sparkling clean inside and out when I left.  For $19.99 this was truly a bargain This will definitely become my go-to.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I had a couple of display lights come on and thought it was a tire issue so I went to ""discount tire"", the guys there said it was a tracking issue and recommended ""brakemasters"" so I went there but they said just for the diagnostic is was 89.99, thought about it and decided to try the ""grant road auto center"" near my house, I am so happy I did, the repair was about 50.00 dollars, whereas brake master without fixing anything was a lot more. These guys are honest and hard-working, I highly recommend!!!! Thanks so much!!!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Seems like every time that I don't read the reviews BEFORE I go to a place I get burned. Could have saved myself a lot of grief by coming here first. As previously stated by others this place is horrible. They took 3 hours for an oil change and to put on ONE new tire on my car. THREE HOURS, like how is that possible? I am still waiting for an explanation on that. Oh, and btw I had an appointment. I was not some walk-in off the street. I made an appointment a week in advanced."
Automotive,1.0,OR,"If I could give a rating of 0 I would. Customer service is extremely unhelpful. The representatives lack adequate knowledge and need more training. Therfore, I try not to call. However, recently I called regarding a simple question concerning my statement and the representative initially wouldn't give me an opportunity to ask the question. After I stressed how ridiculous the call was going, I was finally given the opportunity to ask my question. Also, the billing statements need an improvement. Statements lack essential information that other finance companies provide. The website is very vague regarding billing information."
Automotive,4.0,CG,My experience has been very positive. The dealership is very knowledgeable about the vehicles and the customer service is outstanding. I had a great experience with the dealership and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a car. Thank you so much for making my purchase enjoyable and stress free.I would give a zero if I could. I have been going to this location for years and I have never had any problems. Every time I go there for any reason they try to sell me something else that

The front end is also scratched, and the inside of the rear view mirror is completely covered in dirt.  The inside is still dirty and dirty.  The inside is still dirty.  They also do not clean the front end of the car at all.  They did not vacuum the back of the car after the fact, and it was still dirty. "
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Theifs! There are signs up here telling you to stay in your car. There is a sign up to get an oil change and you will pay $30 for a ""good"" oil change. If you need an oil change, I would suggest you do it yourself. I am not going to pay $40 for a basic oil change, but I would suggest you do the same if you are going to pay $40 for a ""good"" oil change."
Automotive,4.0,CG,This place used to be good. The guys here are good but now they have gone downhill. The owner is rude and the owner is a complete jerk. He has no idea how to treat customers. I told him I would be a loyal customer. I was told to go to another mechanic and get a second opinion. I did and I had to wait on my car to be fixed. I was told I would have to wait another 10 minutes for the mechanic to finish up.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"HORRIBLE RIP OFF, go to Instaquick, they are not far away. Midas charges for stale coffee and WIFI, it's a joke. I showed up W/ a 19.99 oil change coupon and they wanted to charge me $70.00 for a small 4 cyl Civic!? This is a red carpet rip off joke. Oil is oil, go someplace else that REALLY Honors coupons. These clowns are rude too, real ""know it all's"" tried to tell me that I ""MUST"" get full synth oil when I clearly have a car manual that states other wise.. Joke of a place don't go!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,I had a great experience getting into my new car Lovell made my car buying experience wonderful.  I have never made a big purchase and this one was amazing.  I had driven a car like the one I bought and I had my eye on the car for a few months. So when my girlfriend bought her new car I need we needed a second vehicle.  Im glad that Enterprise has a hassle free buying rule that they live by.  I'm glad I chose they for buying my car.  Thank you again Lovell
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Update 2.  Brian (0wner) is totally unethical. After providing the BBB and Pinellas County with complaints, his responses were totally BS. And that was after he told me repeatedly that he will return my deposit ""within a week"" now a month or more later, I am determined to fight tooth and nail. It is no longer just about the money.  It is also about not letting cheats like this get away with it.  And he has the nerve to try to intimidate me on the phone.  More to come. Avoid him like the plague!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had shockingly delightful service here a few days ago. A younger man named Brad really helped me out and saved me some money that I might have had to spend replacing the box that holds the license plate lights on my older car (the license plate light's screw was rusted into something or other). He went out of his way to personally check that area of the car and popped the light right out of there with ease. Before checking out, I was asked multiple times if I needed any help from multiple employees."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"While they were nice people, they provided me with inaccurate information that cost me $200.  They explained that since I didn't purchase their in-house road hazard coverage, that my brand new tires would have to be replaced out of pocket.  They didn't explain that my Pirelli tires would have been covered by manufacturer's warranty.  In fact, they BLANTANTLY LIED TO ME and told me that they were NOT covered.  All to make a sale.  THESE PEOPLE WILL ACT LIKE YOUR BEST FRIEND AND THEN CHEAT YOU INTO SPENDING MONEY.  Go somewhere else."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I never had a problem. I Paid thirty dollars for a tire repair at another place. Whi le I was at good year I told them I needed a oil change and how much is a tire repair. they told me its free, even though I didn't buy my tires there. I used them for tires, oil changes, batteries, inspections and never had a problem. I laugh at a women who thinks its sexist to say, its nice to see a women who takes care of her car. how shallow is that. amazing how shallow people have become"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Ken and the staff at this location could not have possibly been nicer or more helpful. I initially called this location because they were listed as a provider under my extended tire warranty. Although Ken was unfamiliar with the specific program I was in, he nonetheless told me to come in and they would take a look. It legitimately took longer for them to get through to the claims department than it did for them to actually replace my tire. Thank you all so very much for going above and beyond and getting me back on the road!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,I had a really rough father's day weekend. I was supposed to drive down to CA to see my dad and my car crapped out on me. I called 10 places before I called this one and no one could get me in for almost a week. They took me in next day and were super nice. They also handled my car issues professionally and quickly. It's been a couple weeks now and no problems with the car. The price was reasonable and if i have any other issues with the car I will be going back there.
Automotive,2.5,CG,Unfortunately we have had nothing but problems with the rental car we reserved. When we got to the dealership we were told the car would be ready by the end of the day. When we arrived we were told it was in the garage. When we asked if it was ready we were told the car was not ready. We were told it was not ready and it would be ready by the end of the day. When we returned to pick up the car they told us that it had not been ready

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Just had $2,500 dollars work done on my 2006 Expedition. It was work that needed to be done (Coilovers, Tuneup, Catalytic Converters). The truck runs great and is ready for the next 178,000 miles. Robyn was great in keeping me apprised of the status of my vehicle. I did have to price shop on my own for a better price for the catalytic converters. However, once made aware of a cheaper option, Flammer Ford parts department acquired the less expensive catalytic converters without hassle. Flammer Ford has always provided a good experience for servicing all three of my Fords."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"If I could give a zero I would. I'm a black man and got called a boy by the raciest staff working there. When I made contact with them it was obvious it was a mistake. This place is a disgrace to true professional establishment. There's no way they have such a high score these idiots couldn't spell cat if you spotted them the c and the a. Stay clear of this raciest business. I went just down the street on the right, going south to Meineke. Dropped $900 on repairs but night and day on professionalism and trust."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Came into Reno for the Superbowl 2010 and the Subie blew it's turbo coming up the grade. Made to the hotel and had it towed to Lithia Subaru on Monday morning.

Scott gave us super good service, talked with our mechanic back home to share with them what went wrong and did it all within the one day we hoped it would take. Gotta love the casino comps to take the edge off an unexpected additional day. We did have a loose hose from the coolant system that we had to reattach, but we were pleased with the service overall."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I was so impressed by the work that was done by this family run business.  Matt returned my call quickly, and he and his son (Nick) were able to come to my parent's house to replace my windshield so I did not have to drive it to a shop. I highly recommend the awesome service, and appreciate their integrity and friendly natures. They are experts at what they do, and I was very happy with the final installation of my new windshield. The added bonus was being able to support a small business that provides such quality work."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I have had several my motorcycle and several scooters serviced by these guys over the past 5 years.
They are always pleasant and easy to deal with.
They have done a good job and been reliable on everything.
I used their pick up service to get my bike today and they saved me some time that way.

I think you get just slightly more than you pay for here. They are not as polished as a BMW dealership but they don`t need to be. 

I am always happy to go here because I know I get my bike back running in great condition."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"HORRIBLE service. Waited an hour for a spare tire that someone was supposedly already on their way to get. LIE! Heard him after all the time sitting there tell someone To go get a tire. Still didn't leave with a tire. Gas tank completely empty and now have to drive back the next day to get a tire. Also like others have said no ones ever around to ask about cars. Was told to come at 10:00 to come look at car, guy didn't show up until after 11. Hours say 9-5. Not happy with service what so ever!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Wanna talk about pricing, he is the most reasonable shop around on pricing, his tech work so hard to make sure the job is done right!  Other shops and dealers are charging 120+ an hour for work and  are doing a half ass job on it just to move your bike out of their way, but Andre and his guys take the time to thorough go through and make sure that they are not missing anything!   Reasonable shop, reasonable prices for work and an all around great atmosphere!!! You can't get any better than that!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,They had the tire I needed and no one else did so I decided to use them. They charged me more than quoted blaming it on the computer. $20 more is $20 more than quoted or expected. They did not do anything about it. The tire still had the blue protective coating all over it. I had to ask them to clean it off so they did but took no time it wiping the wheel down to get any excess dirt off. They just seem very unorganized and lacking in customer service. Trying and doing are two different things.
Automotive,4.5,CG,"I had an issue with my tire and they fixed it for free.

Automotive,2.5,CG,"Make certain that you read this before you go to this dealership. 

The person who helped us was not very friendly. She was very polite, but not the most professional. We had to take her to get a ride to the dealership. She was very rude. She was also rude. She was very nasty to us. 

I had to wait 3 hours for a shuttle to pick us up. She was not friendly. She acted like she couldn't care less about us."
Automotive,4.0,CG,Ordered tires on line at $24.95 and they did a great job. I was in and out within an hour. I will definitely return for any tires needs.They were so nice and honest.

The check in was super quick but what made the difference is that the gentleman assisting me offered to drive me to the airport so that I wouldn't miss my flight.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"I bought 4 adapters last year. Lenny was great, gave sound advise, guided me on minimum thickness that I could go and still have adapters, and service after the sale is superb! Over the winter I swapped out my factory axle and the adapters no longer fit due to an increased center bore/register diameter.  Called Lenny today and he said no problem! They are able to bore my adapters to the new diameter,  so I won't have to buy new ones. Service after the sale is outstanding,  I recommend Motorsport Tech to anyone needing adapters or spacers."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Took my car here for inspection, they tried to sell me $1,800 worth of work. The only thing it needed for inspection was a ball joint, which they wanted nearly $400 to do on only 1 side; everything else they wanted to do was just add on sales. I took the car and replaced the ball joints on both sides for under $100. When I brought it back so they could see it had been repaired, I was charged again for the inspection. I've never been charged for a reinspection before. I gave them a try, but won't be back."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"They had sold my mother 2 tires at extremely high price for what it's worth.  Not all Japanese made tires are expensive and prrstige.  Sumitomo is a value brand not to be sold at almost double the price!  I wouldn't put this junk on my car, she's already complaining they are quite slippery when rds are wet.  225 55 18 size is common and not considered high performance.  $150 installed + tax for a cheap Jap value brand is not worth it.  She could have gotton piralli ot Goodyear tires for same price elsewhere."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This place is to be avoided at all costs.  The employees there are rude, inconsiderate and selfish.  They have no conscience of any moral character.  They treat customers like they are criminals and waste you entire day away.  Spent an entire day away and saw my number up there and when I got to the window they moved on to the next number after waiting for the person to come back from lunch.  I was told in a mean spirited rude tone and face to get another number and wait 3 more hours.  Absurd."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Great customer service. Fair, honest and always decent prices. I had one incident where we ended up troubleshooting a problem and I paid to have something fixed that didn't fix the problem. They were fair with me after learning of what the actual problem was (something that should have been caught in visual inspection) and gave me a credit of 50% of the price I paid. I had agreed to the service so I felt that this was very fair. I work on my own vehicles when I can, and I trust Arrow to work on them when I can't."
Automotive,2.5,OR,bought a 2006 Lexus RX330 from here paid over $9000.00. 5 weeks later a maintenance light came on so took in for oil change and then was told both struts were blown and both drive shafts were bad as well as both lower control arms and ball joints. Cost me just over $1800.00 and was too late to return as a lemon (4 weeks was max for that) I tried emailing to see if they would compensate me since I was sold a NOT as in good shape a car and was told.

My auto wasn't bad to begin with.Carpet cleaner, but not all stains removed,crud still left in some places that was overlooked.Once I got home I was able to clean the knobs and dripping cleanser that was left from the shop. Problem may have been rushing to do cars that all had the same appointment. If you are looking for interior detail work,better to pay the extra elsewhere,reason why I didnt complain.If your car is super dirty it is worth the price."
Automotive,2.5,CG,Let's start off with saying that I have an appointment and I need to make an appointment to have my tire repaired.  The people at this location are the most honest and competent in their work.  I have been in the business for 20 years.  This is my second time at this location and I will continue to do so.  They have made me feel like family and I will continue to bring my cars here for routine service and any future repairs.  They have always been very professional and

I have had it serviced there twice now and every time they have done a great job.  They have made me feel like they really care about me.  This time I took the car to another shop and it was well worth the price."

I was told the tires were in great shape and I should wait. After waiting, I came back to get my car and"

I'd give them a five star rating if I could.I had an excellent experience at Chapman Honda. My sales associate, John Davis, was very helpful and knowledgeable.

The store manager, Eric, was very friendly and professional.  He was very professional"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Less than a year ago, I had an oil change done at another dealership, and I'm still here waiting for the oil change, and they're still not done. They say it's ready, and it's in the same location as it was when I dropped it off. I also had a 2 day rental car to go to, and I had to bring the car back in. I was charged a total of $50 for an oil change, and a $20 for the inspection."

These guys are fabulous. We had 4 different people taking great care of us. My wife and I had an appointment and we walked in, were warmly greeted, felt NO pressure, just positive, enthusiastic welcoming service. No haggling, they made it so easy I really was pleasantly surprised. Now I have my dream car F Sport!

But on a trip to Nashville I summoned a Lyft to a hotel input which I properly entered for a destination, got a ""good deal"" prompt ($15 fare) for one driver which I selected, and then met driver when he arrived. He told and showed me a $31 fare. ???!!! I was livid but thought we could fix the problem en route. I thought wrong. I'm going back and forth with customer service who is taking no ownership for app dysfunction."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Mike and his team are true experts! They did a professional job on what I consider my chariot a 2020 Range Rover Special Vehicle Autobiography Nardo Grey (only 34 produced in 2020 aka ""the year of CoVid"").  Mike appreciated the value this car has to me and had delivered a fabulous paint protection coat and 3x ceramic coat.  The laser cut coating fit flawlessly.  Mike felt I could not leave my car for too long so got the job done in 24 hrs and had my ride in their temperature controlled room. Again thank you so much Mike!!!!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"The service from Dr. Detail was SUPREME!  The interior of our SUV is mostly white and cream.  It was a mess!  There were spots on the white visors and head liner.  The seats had blue dye on them from jeans.  Every crevice and vent was dirty.  I expected the vehicle to be cleaned, but I've paid the almost the same at car washes for a thorough detail, including carpet clean, and my car has never been perfect....ever, before Dr. Detail did their magic!  They will even come to you!  I highly recommend them."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Yet another place that scams women. I'm finding I need to stick with the ""mom and pop"" places to trust any car places.

I went in there with a coupon...they said they couldn't use it. They didn't give an explanation but said that they ""can still give me a great deal"". Well, I left there spending about 10 times as much as the coupon and had to do it on their ""credit"" so I won't get charged interest for the large amount.

I'll never ever go there again. Their coupons lure people in and they say they can't even use it? No thanks."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"I'm not gonna lie. There were a couple of times where the work done did not fix the issue in the initial visit, but I had no problems when I had to bring the car back. They worked on the car again and fixed the issue at no extra charge. They even replaced some parts at no extra charge. I've had my last few oil changes there and my car recently inspected and passed with no problems. They are always very nice and respectful. My mother also goes there and has never had any complaints. Thank you for the great service."
Automotive,2.5,OR,I've been a member of their unlimited car wash deal for 6 months now and I can't speak more highly of it. For about $30 a month you get unlimited washes which for me is necessary having a white car in Florida. I go to the Dale Mabry location and it's always a less than 10 minute affair to drive through the car wash to get my exterior cleaned. They make it so easy (a team member just scans the barcode on your dash and away you go) and there are so many staff on hand at all times.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"The perfect BMW.
I recently purchased a 2019 X5 and I love it. I had the pleasure of working with Alex Wolfe who from the very start went above and beyond to make it a smooth car buying process. As my car will be registered in MD, the dealer including the sales manager, finance manager, and GM were very instrumental in making me feel confident about the deal and titling the vehicle in MD.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"Do not purchase the extended protection plans from them. When you want to cancel them, which is your right, they give you the run around. In my case Lee Geringer. I've asked to cancel these warranties since late August. He hardly ever replies to emails. January he finally wrote that he  forgot to mail the cancellation of (how convenient). I emailed the GM David Lee directly, not even a response from him. I am beyond frustrated. Don't even buy from them is my advice! Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired, and I don't believe they have any integrity."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I rarely go to mechanics because I am very well versed on working on cars. When I do need a mechanic, I go to Hartmann's. Since the first time I went there Dan, his staff have been very honest and friendly. He has always been very straight forward with the work that needs to be done without price gouging or adding unnecessary work that doesn't need to be done. I have had no troubles with the quality of work after it has been done and they do warrantee it. I highly recommend them for auto repair on cars and big pickup trucks."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Took delivery of an $84k toy hauler in Sep, discovered quickly that they're quite accomplished at dodging service-after-sale issues. Sales person Christy's repeated statements that ""we'll come take care of that"", still haven't been acted upon. Escalated our issues to Colerain Indy manager last month, and were told they're ""waiting on parts"". Called him again this month, and we're told that he'd ""look into it"". When he finally DID call back, it was yet another disappointing "" we're still waiting on parts"". We want to hook up and go south for the winter, but these issues have us tethered. Very frustrating experience."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"This shop is expensive and difficult to work with.  They didn't get it right and the car is still not fixed, but I don't want to go back to deal with them and their terrible un-customer-friendly service a third time in two days. The staff person and owner tried to argue their way out of doing the job right, countering their own statements and tried anything to get out of a fair solution.

In response to Susie S., I do indeed now live in Nashville and I had a terrible experience with your shop. It is not a case of mistaken identity."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This shop is kind, fair, and does amazing work. My Dad had an accident. The car was towed to another shop that held the car for 8 days and would not give me a written estimate but charged a daily storage fee. I asked Lloyds to pick it from that other shop. Within 2 hours I had a detailed written estimate and an honest recommendation to either fix it or not. I chose to fix it. They did an amazing job. Car looks fantastic and most of all they were responsive, kind, honest, and great repair people. I would highly recommend them."

The car should have been around $104 when we go to get the car and I look at our account they charged us almost 500 because the 200 hold they put on the card. I took the car back because I thought that 277 was too much for 3 days. They said that they do not accept priceline. com insurance and we had to use theirs. I returned the car we had for a total of three hours it cost me $40. i will never deal with them again or priceline.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Simply a great group of guys to work with in buying a used car.  Sales person Cameron cannot do enough for each customer, mechanic Jeff definitely knows the mechanics and history of each car and the owner Mark takes well deserved pride in having so many repeat customers.  Bought a 2006 Acura MDX for my son and he loves the car more and more each day as he gets familiar with all of the features.  If you're looking for an excellent, no pressure sales experience with a nice selection of used cars at great prices, this is your dealership."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"So I haven't been to this location in quite some time, simply because they are so ungodly slow, but I tried to give it another shot for the first time in a year or so, and they didn't let me down. One car in front of me, probably waited 45 minutes? Not sure why I didn't leave, probably because there was a car behind me and I couldn't get out. People seem nice, but they need to figure out how to change oil faster, every other location I've been to get you in and out in under 10 minutes."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I had my car detailed while I held a garage sale.  Merrick came to my home and spent hours on my car, completely self-contained with all he had in his truck.  I think he may have spent close to 7 hours on my car.  I have two small kids and the car had not had any detailing since I purchased it years ago! The end product was absolutely stellar and Merrick worked so meticulously, every aspect of my car looked brand new.  Excellent service, amazing product, and friendly staff.  We will definitely be using their services again!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"We've used this service several times and can't say enough about the ease with which we've started our trips.  Parking lot (sometimes very full,but always room for one more) pick up means never waiting for the shuttle van.  A quick trip to the airport, delivered right to the airline departure door, expedient pick up on return.  Zip, zip, zip.  Never fight airport traffic and parking problems again.  And, the cost is the lowest we've found.  But do be sure to reserve ahead of time -- both for a better price and to be assured a space."

My roadside assistance covered $75 Gary's told me that the ""hook up fee"" itself was $75.  My roadside assistance said that they were going to see about removing Gary's Towing from thier provider list.

Automotive,2.5,CG,Took my car there several times. The first time they did a horrible job. I took my car in for an oil change.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"Not happy at all, instead of taking the extra few minutes to properly undo the clips holding the trim on around the windshield they just ripped it out and glued them back on. They also used so much urethane that it leaked down into the engine compartment and got onto wires and stuff, and scratched up the frame which then rusted in some places. It ended up costing almost $1,000 to have everything fixed, buy new trim from the dealer, and have the rust sanded off and repainted (it's a new car). So basically my entire experience was awful, save yourself the headache."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Convenient location, van to cruise line was OK, took quite a while for pick up after cruise, but eventually got back to the car. It worked for a reasonable price. However, the only ""bummer"" on for this service is that I forgot a carry all bag in the van. I have contacted 214 Car Service via voice mail (2x) and email (4x) and have and probably will not receive a response. I offered to pay for shipping and their time and effort. So bottom line insure you have everything with you when you leave their area....cause they sure don't respond to your requests."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My experience at John Kennedy Ford was second to none!
The sales manager Marty was the most knowledgeable, respectable and caring individual that I have ever experienced in purchasing a car. I came in with a dilemma, and left one happy person. Marty really cares about his client's needs. Also, he makes you feel right at home like you are part of the family. I have been buying cars for many years, and I feel that he is one of the best person's that I have dealt with in the car industry. If I could give him a score of 100, I would!

Spoke to they owner, he said that's what everyone does...they wouldn't get business if they gave quotes at the price they planned to charge. They knew we were paying out of pocket and price was a factor in our decision!!! Unbelievable! I couldn't believe he actually admitted to intentionally quoting at a price they knew was low!

5 stars for Cyle & the rest of the guys in the service department. I visited twice recently for service and both times, Cyle went above & beyond to take care of me. He even answered all those annoying questions I had! What a great guy.

I was greeted promptly upon arriving, my car was quickly taken care of, and before I knew it, I was on my way home.

If your Toyota needs service, head to Ardmore Toyota & look for Cyle or one of the other guys. I promise you will receive a 5 star visit, just like I did."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I was very disappointed with my wash the other day. I paid for the titanium wash and was not happy driving away. If I didn't have to rush off I would have turned around and had them finish it. My black dusty dashboard wasn't wiped down or the inside of the windshield. I thought when they said my car was done it was awfully quick after it came out of the washer, and now I know why! And it was a weekday in the AM and wasn't even very busy. Wish I could have taken back the tip I put in the box."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Guess I had a different experience. Took my wife's car in. They tried to turn a 20 dollar oil change into 200 dollars. For example they told me the coolant was very low. I went out and looked - reservoir right between the min and max. They told me I needed a new air filter. Asked to see it, it was almost totally white. Kept pushing to change oil in rear differential. I just had that done 3000 miles ago. I told them - they have me a line that it had to be done again. They are crooks. I would stay away."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I recently visited Firestone, because I had a slow leak in my tire. My husband was out of town for a month and I have 2 disabled kids. The technician located the hole in my tire, but unfortunately could not be repaired because it was outside the tread area. My option was to put the spare on or purchase a new tire. I did not have a spare and had $2 in my account. The store manager authorized a new tire for my car at no charge. Tim was amazing. I never imagined this and it was an extreme blessing! Thank you Firestone!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,I arrived with only 2 cars in front of me in line.  An hour later and still waiting.  The staff seems to be working but have no where near enough people and the manager just seems to be wondering around until someone complained there was no one ringing anyone up.   A further delay was caused by who appeared to be an off duty employee who they allowed to go around the line vacuumed his car took it through the wash and then helped him dry while the line increased.  Decent wash but some seriously management and training needed.

They offer free vacuums and vacuum. 

If you have a car, the car wash does a great job. 

The only issue is that they do not have a service area to wipe down the inside of your car. 

They also offer free vacuums with a free car wash.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"I usually go to VW shop for auto repairs, etc. in Ardmore, but because all I needed was a simple inspection, I decided to go to this Firestone in West Phil several months ago.  I was told to do repairs/improvements that were not necessary.  What the Firestone staff was saying sounded so shady, I asked them to do just inspection and took my car to the VW shop. VW staff told me that all the things that were suggested by Firestone were completely not necessary. I almost spent $1000 more for unnecessary ""improvements/maintenance"" at Firestone.  I do not recommend this place."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I love these guys. They are honest and professional. I've used two of the three stores and the experience is consistent. They are good about recommending used parts when it is reasonable, good about telling you that you can wait a little longer for a repair, and do great work at a reasonable price. They'll also drop you off if you're work/home isn't too far. On the rare occasion when I've had an issue, they were excellent about resolving it. Going here is like taking my car to a trusted friend. Thanks Reno Vulcanizing for taking such great care of me and my car."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"I parked at the Silo parking lot and received a parking fine while I was paying for their over-priced parking at the kiosk.  Fortunately for me, my receipt was time stamped one minute before the violation notice.  These folks are near criminal.  I suspect they hire thugs to monitor their lots and incentive them by compensating them on a percentage of the fines they issue.  All visitors to Nashville should be warned at the car rental agencies to avoid Premier Parking.  Most Nashville residents already have learned this.   Avoid at all cost, or pay a large cost!"

Appt Monday with shop for an estimate on the repair of cosmetic damage, I'll update this review during this process. They did warn me about registration delays, I'm hoping it goes smooth.  So far, very easy and convenient, for a online purchase of a used car, which is scary.
Update: Cosmetic repairs from delivery inspection approved by Carvana in 1 day. Registration is complete. Everything went smooth, a great experience."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I have been here several times.  They never have enough employees to be able to get the vehicles done well and efficiently.  We have had to bring our cars back twice because they were not cleaned on the inside or outside.  Their number system in how they clean the car is not efficient.  I feel bad for the supervisors because they are having to go back over the work that has already been done.  There are employees that take pride in their job and are awesome,  there is also employees that don't care and do the bare minimum."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I called Heithcock when it looked as though I had an ignition switch problem and they were very responsive.  While I was waiting for them, I tried my truck again and it cranked.  They were pulling around the corner, and I explained to the driver what had happened...and that since it had cranked, I would simply drive myself to the dealer.  I offered to pay a fee for their drive, but he said it was no problem!  He was a really nice guy, and I appreciate how quickly they responded.  I will ALWAYS use Heithcock Towing in the future."

I wish I had wrote down his name, his cashier number is 457406 at store 143, and he deserves a raise and all the kudos for his stellar customer service. Thank you for turning my evening around!

My final call i advised insurance co to cancel this tow company, file my time complaint and to look at their other reviews.

Upon arrival, told Nissan rebates/residuals etc has changed in Jan and now new pricing applied??????? Emails were exchanged almost daily prior to arrival and none of this was mentioned.  I walked away and think this is a classic example of car dealers being like old horsetraders.  This was a huge inconvenience and I consider it deceptive/lacking integrity.  Would not recommend.  Looks like what is happening at the top of Nissan has permeated through the organization."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"So thankful we found this dealership!  Traveling from out of state to Nashville, we have a ""check engine"" light come on and need to find service  ASAP before we drive home to TX. Lori Garrett, Ryan and Rob took care of us immediately and worked to take care of the issue without disrupting our visit or our need to get back home timely. The time Bea spent to talk with and show us the new models, knowing we weren't buying that day, was so appreciated.  Super friendly, professional and accommodating people! Would love them to be our regular dealership!  Denise"

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Went in for an oil change, and the worker managed to break off one of my tire air valves and air pressure sensors.  He also was unable to reset the oil sensor properly.  I found out from a separate tire shop that the cost to repair the tire valve/sensor is over $90 - I called Mike's Hand Wash and Auto Lube to try to see if they would cover the cost of the repair, but they absolutely refused despite their negligence.  Needless to say, I will not be going back to this establishment again and will strongly recommend others to stay away."

I had read that this shop was good and I needed a new muffler and repair to my tailpipe in order to pass smog testing. Since I was in the neighborhood, I thought I would stop in.

As expected the exterior was left a little spotty, and I had no cloths or paper towels with me. Perhaps Mister could provide a chamois, free of charge, to those using the exterior wash option. Overall it removed months worth of built up dirt and grime and my vehicle was shining once more.

I love that they thoroughly check out the car, give a price for needed repairs and quickly get your car back on the road.

These guys are something else! Absolutely amazing. The car is perfect again inside and out. They pay attention to every detail, every nook and cranny.

We've used them about 5 times so far and he service has only gotten better. Honestly, even if you have a favorite detail place that you currently use, give these guys a try.

I brought my mother's buick regal in for an oil change and car wash and was charged an xtra $6 because they say it's a special filter?  That sounds like BS! What are you supposed to do when they already have your car. The price goes up but the service is just not the same.
I'm not happy with their continued business practices. Last trip here for me. Better option out there for my hard earned money."

Expect long wait times, and just slow terrible service altogether. Why does an oil change take an hour and a half every single time? Oh maybe it's because your staff likes to take my car and then go smoke cigarettes in the back after it's been sitting which I've observed them doing.

Big thanks to Abraham and the Bob Holzer team; knowledgeable, efficient, friendly."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Decided to use Potters Precision Imports for the first time to get my brakes checked on my 2015 VW Passat. Richard, Tom and the technician were all very friendly, knowledgeable & happily answered all my questions. They were honest and told me exactly what was wrong and what I did not need to worry about. Their prices were fair and they definitely believe in using geniuine parts. Definetely, found the shop I can trust to keep my VW in great condition going forward. 
FYI- One of the nicest repair shop I have ever been in... The waiting area is clean and comfortable if you have to wait."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Don't go here!!! I got two tires for over a thousand dollars from here, I checked my rims before they worked on them, afterwards there was two chips in one of the rims.  They would not do anything about it and said their machine could not have done that.  They didn't put the caps on the tires either, I had to go back and get them.  
Good idea to always take a picture of your rims before any work is done on them.
I wanted to have a good experience with them because of what they do for our city but stand behind your work!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"The service is usually pretty slow checking out, but the staff has been pretty knowledgable whenever I have asked a question.  They will run free battery diagnostics and if you purchase a battery from them, they will install it for free.  

Pro tip: If you have a smart phone, you can look on their website while in the store, sometimes the website has better deals.  I was able buy a battery on my phone while standing in the store so that I could use a 30% off internet coupon, it was ""delivered"" to the store within five minutes and they intalled it right there."
Automotive,2.0,CG,I drove through White Glove and it was the best car wash in Reno! The guy was friendly and knowledgeable and the car was spotless. He also had a great price for the wash. I will definitely come back here for any of my car needs! I will be back!I would give a zero if I could. I went in to get a simple tire repair and they told me my tire had to be replaced. They told me I needed a new tire and that they could do it for $75.
Automotive,3.0,CG,"This Dealership used to be a great place to purchase a car.  Today, I went to the other dealer in the area and got a good deal on a new car.  The salesman, Steve, told me that the car was on their lot.  He told me that the car had a 2 year warranty on the vehicle and that the car was on their lot.  I told him I would buy the car and I would go on my way.  I went back to the dealership to sign paperwork and Steve assured me that"
Automotive,2.0,CG,Great Service!! They went above and beyond and the workmanship was perfect. Thank you!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change. The guy was not happy about it and was just trying to make it right. I told him I was going to wait for the oil change. He was just going to get the oil change and then I went back to the car and was told that they were finishing up my car. I told him I was not going to wait for the oil change.
Automotive,2.5,CG,"This place is a complete rip off and the owner is a total scumbag. I just wanted to get an oil change and inspection. He then said he didn't have time to do it. I told him I would be back for it. He said ""It's not going to be a problem. "" I said I wanted to make sure I had a good day. He said ""I just want to make sure you can go to the dealership because it will be very busy. "" I said fine, I'll just wait."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"I just got the unlimited car wash and the wash itself was a nice touch. I was pretty impressed with the service. The staff was friendly and polite. I think the wash itself was nice. They had a few spots on the floor mats and some water spots on the back seats. I had a bit of a rinse to get off but the car wash was pretty good. I will go back.This is the worst car dealership I have ever dealt with. I have been a loyal customer for 30 years, and I have NEVER had a"

Thanks to the guys at the front desk and the crew at the front desk.I wish I could give this place no stars.  They quoted me a price and then when I went to pick it up the price was $6,300 more than what I paid for it to get my car back.  I had to drive it to the dealer for a repair and then"
Automotive,3.0,CG,How is this place three stars? The guys here are super friendly and helpful. I came in to get an oil change and I was out in less than 30 minutes. They were super nice and honest. I will be back in a heartbeat.I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely helpful and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to get my car serviced. I will recommend them to anyone I know!I recently purchased a brand new Tacoma from here and it was a great experience. The sales team was
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I had my oil changed here a couple years ago. I will say that I have been a customer here for over 20 years. The guys are friendly, knowledgeable, and take care of everything. They are thorough and efficient. I would recommend them to anyone. I had a very positive experience with a used Honda CR-V. I was very impressed with the level of service I received from Mark. He gave me a fair price and made sure I was getting a good deal. I would definitely recommend this dealership for any Honda needs."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Wish I could leave this review. The dealership is a joke. 

The first time we visited this dealership we were greeted by a very friendly, knowledgeable, and knowledgeable sales manager. He was extremely friendly and helped us find a vehicle that was right for our needs. The manager also helped us find the perfect vehicle to meet our needs. The finance manager was very patient and helpful. He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle we were interested in and was very patient with us. We went for a test drive and were very happy with"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Our salesman Steve was absolutely fantastic! He treated us like family got us a great deal on a Durango and had us in and out faster than any other car purchase! We purchased a new car in August 2019 and I always wait to post reviews  for cars because they are always nice when you purchase but Steve truly has been the nicest guy! When we went in for our remote start install he hung out with us for a little while we waited and most importantly kept our 2 year old entertained while we were finishing the paperwork!  Great guy, great service, and great car!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I regret giving them a second chance. Another Very poor and unfriendly service experience at suntrup. I called them 5 hours ahead of my appointment and let them know I needed to modify my service appointment. They assured me would be able to accommodate my changes. Upon arrival, I was told that the technicians were no longer there and they couldn't get me in for another week. Service attendant made no attempt to resolve the issue or accommodate their mistake. 

Don't waste your money or energy at suntrup. There are other shops that will get the job done right the first time and treat their customers with respect"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"-10 STARS. 
This business has BOMBARDED my phone with repeated ROBOCALLS from various local (520) numbers (but, some are identified as ""Casa Grande"") MULTIPLE times each day (even at after 8:00 PM), every day for the past week.

I never answer calls from numbers I don't recognize, so they leave messages over and over again on my voicemail, asking me to call them regarding looking at their inventory of cars, pre-qualifying for their financing, etc..

I am not in the market for a car, but even if I was, I would NEVER give my business to any company with such obnoxious, disrespectful, and irritating marketing tactics like this one uses."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Went there to test drive a car. 
The car was not there. 
Turned out to be a loaner car. 
1500miles and wanted full price like a new car. 
The salesman where not that good. 
They kept telling us to call them back. 
They just wanted to text. 
    Very sad.  Funny they said we could not get a better deal........lol right. 
If you look at Car Guru you can find better deals in Indiana. 
Less than a 3 hours drive and saved big money. 
  Look it up your selves. 
I do not get paid so I will not use the dealers name."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I was recently referred to A & M Auto Body which is family run by my mechanic at Superior Auto Care in Queens Village and was not disappointed. Mike managed to squeeze me in during the holiday season when understaffed and still met and exceeded my expectations. He was kind and patient and the price was very fair. He set expectations about turn around time in advance and was able to deliver ahead of time. I will come here again if necessary and plan to refer anyone who needs body work done in Center City to Mike if ever asked... Mike, thank you again for top notch service!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Everything was fine till my credit union called to say my payment was late ....dealer did not payoff trade in the 10 days they indicated ....now there is 70 dollars in fees and 65 in interest due .....we over estimated our payoff and dealer owes us over 600 refund and will not return our call....we have emailed and called several times.  This is totally not the xperience we were told would happen ....seems like this dealer might like to burn bridges after one sale

Update.... After this finally came to attention of Sam the owner....everything has been satisfied 
   Thank you Sam for your help !!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"My husband and I have had a few different things done to both of our cars at Telle Tire and we always walk away feeling satisfied, as satisfied as you can feel after dealing with car drama and shelling out unexpected large sums of money for said car dram. BUT we all know how that feels. 

We are always treated with respect, the lobby/waiting area is clean, I never feel like I'm being lied to- all the great simple things you want out of an auto service business!

I will be back to Telle within the next month, so I hope to have another positive update for my review!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Amazing amazing amazing!!!! I hit a median and popped a tire at work. Had to baby the car home because spare was messed up and by the time we got the car home most places were closed.  But not Bella Tires. Not only were they open they are very affordable.  They didn't try and upsell us or haggle more into it,  they gave us exactly what we asked for at a great price and had the new tire mounted balanced and we were out the door in under 15 minutes. Customer services was amazing.  I would recommend them over and over and over again!!!!!."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Not impressed. Went here with my car looking for a decent wash.  Paid for the most expensive wash ($13-ish?) to get water spots and some pollen off my car (nothing crazy, my car is only 4 weeks old).  Went through the wash, parked to look at my car afterwards and the blowers did a terrible job drying it so I needed to dry it myself... good thing I did bc I needed to wipe off the film layer and water spots. Car looked like crap and a total waste of money. I'm so disappointed. I just want a car wash to make my car look clean!"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"This place is right on time and professional. 

I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation and had a great experience.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The waiting room was comfortable and clean.  

I would definitely recommend this place.I would give a zero if I could.  I went in to have a tire plugged and I was told it would take about an hour to an hour to plug.  I arrived at 9:30am and was told it would take about an hour. "
Automotive,4.0,CG,My boyfriend and I love this place and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I have been coming here for years and have never had a problem with the service or the prices.I have been going to this location for oil changes for years. They have always been very reasonable and have always been extremely fast. They have the most convenient location and have never tried to upsell me. They have always been very quick and reasonably priced. They have a friendly waiting room which is very nice. They have a nice comfy waiting room with a TV
Automotive,4.5,CG,"Jewelry was STOLEN from my last visit, and the folks at the front desk were very friendly and professional. I had a coupon for a oil change, and the price was very reasonable. They had me in and out in a matter of 15 minutes. I was very pleased with the service. I will definitely return to them for my next oil change. These guys are great! I went there to have some work done on my truck and they took the time to explain everything to me in detail."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I began the process of buying a car with the help of a salesperson, I was not alone. I had a great experience. The car was clean and well maintained. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of service provided by the salesperson who helped me. I felt like a valued customer. I will be returning to the dealership to buy another car. I was very pleased with the car I was purchasing. I will definitely buy another car from this dealership. I highly recommend the dealership."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"The receptionist was incredibly rude and condescending. She seemed very cold and didn't seem to care. She basically told me to leave, and that she would not let me leave. I was so upset that I left. I'm not going back.I brought my car here after having a flat tire. They fixed it within 30 minutes. They did a great job and they were extremely friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend them.Great experience. I came in to get a tire patched and they were able to get me in immediately."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"My Ford Explorer was serviced here a couple years ago. I will admit that I have been pretty impressed with the service I've received from both the mechanics and the customer service. I've been taking my car there for over 30 years, and I have never had any issues. The staff is always friendly and professional. I've never had an issue with the work they've done on my vehicle, and I will continue to bring my vehicle to them for any work that I need.I have been to this location for a few years. "
Automotive,2.0,CG,Great staff and great service. We will be back!I've been going to this car wash for years. Every time I've been there they have been extremely friendly and helpful. The only issue is they are not open on Sundays. If you come to the car wash for the day it's not open on Sundays. I had to wait on my car to be cleaned. I went there to have my car washed and they did a great job. I will be going back to get my car washed again.
Automotive,1.5,CG,"Took the bike in today and it was done very quickly.

Highly recommended!I am a fan of the service I receive at this dealership. I have had great experiences with this dealership. I have been in the service department for about two years and have always been very pleased with the service. I have also had my wife's car serviced here several times and I have never had any issues. They have a nice waiting room with complimentary coffee and a good selection of beverages. They have a nice waiting room with a TV,"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"My family and I have been coming here for over 15 years.  They have always been friendly and knowledgeable.  

However, last week, we got a flat tire and were stranded in a parking lot in the middle of the highway.  This morning, we called the number and was told that they were going to get right in.  They called us back and said that they had a tire in stock and they would get us right in.  They said they could get us right in, but they were backed up. "
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Absolutely no stars for this business. Called to ask a simple question about how many days I needed to purchase. My flight would be leaving on a Tuesday, and I would be picking my car up before noon on Thursday. That would be 3 days correct? Well the woman on the phone said I needed to buy 4 days. When I asked her why, she said ""go ahead and buy 3, do whatever you want, but 3"" and was extremely irritated that I had a simple question. She spoke over me the entire time I was on the phone with her. DEFINITELY not leaving my car with this company."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I had an excellent experience at Hollywood Motor Company.  I am still in love with the vehicle that I purchased and honestly couldn't believe that I could afford something so upscale!  The staff was really great and was willing to work with my budget, which was awesome. 

The entire process was thorough and detailed and my salesperson Mr. Motown was very down to earth, which was nice for a change.

I would recommend Hollywood Motor Company to anyone in the market for buying a new vehicle.  Good credit, bad credit - either way, they can help suit your needs. And honestly, I think you'll leave pleasantly surprised!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I have been coming here the last few years, I used to live down the road from them and now it's a little more of a drive - and I will still come to these guys. Super helpful, nice, and tell you how it is. They are transparent about decision making to be done on my car. Also, super patient and willing to go the extra mile if they have the capacity. Totally reccomend Otto's, they do take care of their customers.
If you need to wait around there are a few things in the area to get food or just walk, not far from downtown Media :) Thanks guys!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"This company came highly recommended by both Yelp and a work associate that had his headliner replaced. I inspected their work first hand and appreciated the quality. After a bit of a snafu with my original scheduling, I had Jason come out on a Saturday to replace my Honda Civic headliner. He had the EXACT color match, and was done within about an hour. The car interior was completely cleaned up, and the price was very fair for them to come to you. Jason was very accommodating, and even notified me of the headliner being out so I could add some sound deadening material to the roof."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Ok so I contacted the Service Manager a couple months ago to complain about not getting my vehicle back in a timely manner. I was assured that the problem has been rectified. He lead me to believe that the service advisors were taking advantage of people using the key drop regardless if we made an appoinment b/c well if we could be ok with not being with a car so long before the appoinment then we could just be pushed back b/c we clearly didn't NEED our vehicles. The last 2 times I have taken my vehicle the both have been ready before noon instead of 545. Well done.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Attentive, straightforward, conscientious, and reasonable. Amro & his crew know what they're doing, are good at what they do, and go the extra mile to take care of you & your vehicle. They kept me in the loop and were very upfront with me as they were diagnosing my car troubles, being practical & strategic with their approach rather than trying to take advantage of a potential big labor cost. They talked to me like a normal human being, and I never felt like I was being hustled or anything. I feel confident putting complete trust in them and their expertise. Very happy to be a client of theirs!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Got a flat tire from the day before that I needed patched, so I took it to Murray's. He asked if I wanted to wait or come back, I had a couple things to do so I opted for swinging back in after an hour (I'm sure if I had waited it would have been quicker). I stopped back in after an hour and the wheel was waiting for me, patched, and ready to go. He even offered to switch out my spare, which I took him up on and I was back off and running 5 minutes after I had pulled in. Top notch service and greatly appreciated!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Every time I go. I have bad a experience with the customer service. Went in today to pull a transmission for my car. They had a 25% off engines and transmission. Once I pulled the transmission I go to the counter to pay. I asked the lady about the discount and she it was toolkit rewards members only. So I asked if I could sign up, she said. Then said the discount wouldn't apply to me because it was too late to sign up. But thankfully one of the ladies in the back overhead and told her that my part could be discounted. So therefore 2 stars.  ."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I showed up looking to buy a jeep I had my heart set on. I arrived and at first thought it was going to be very uncomfortable because it was Salesman Bernardo Albarran and two additional trainees. Yes, three of them!  However, It ended up being a wonderful and very pleasant  experience. I felt very comfortable, had plenty of jokes, laughs, and got serious and also got the job done. This team helped me with all my questions and needs. Best of all, I was able to drive off the lot in my new Jeep! 
Thank you Bernardo, Lauren, Trevor  for making this a great experience!"

Automotive,3.5,CG,The has to be the best. The guys are honest and will work with you to make you feel like family. I've also used the service department twice and I've been pleased each time. It's a little pricey for a car but I always feel like they have the best price. I have also found them to be very quick and efficient with the service. They will even give you a discount if you're not happy. I've been here twice and both times I've had a good experience.
Automotive,3.0,CG,Apparently this place thinks it's a scam and they don't know how to turn a situation around. I will never be going back.I went to get a car wash and it was pretty bad. They had no clue how to work a vacuum. I had to ask for the manager. He said it's not their fault and it's their fault. I asked to speak to the manager. He said he will call me back.

You won't regret it. I will always recommend him. I will be back. I would give a zero if I could. I went in to get a tire plugged and they said it would be about an hour and a half.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"Took my Durango in for service. Ron was my Service Advisor. What a great professional, personable guy. Even though they needed to keep my car overnight, before I could ask, he was already telling me that their shuttle was on the way to get me to go rent a car. He took all the worry out of the experience. When we went to get the car, my husband and I wound up trading it in for a new RAM Big Horn for a lower payment. Easiest car purchase transaction ever. Caitlian really believes in customer service and it shows. We will be repeat customers and will recommend them to friends."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Beware!
Normally a good store with good people but I had a disappointing experience this week. I needed Motorcraft 75w140 and Motorcraft 80w90 gear oil. I went on the O'Reilly website and found the gear oil. The 75w140 was listed at $16.99 a quart and the 80w90 at $5.29 a quart. I went to the store confirmed the prices and ordered it there. When I went to pick up the oil the price was DOUBLE the advertised and quoted price. Needless to say I did not purchase the oil from O'Reilly's.
I purchased the oil from Rock Auto for $16.99 and $5.29 plus $7.99 shipping saving a small fortune.
You be the judge."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"For a place as busy as this I can't believe people actually complain about a hand wash and all the detail they put into it. I know sometimes people miss things as a person who takes pride in detailing my own car. But they really did a pretty great job on my car. If you want things done perfectly do it yourself and quit whining. I will be back, maybe on a day I don't have to rush to work, but I think these people do pretty well for being slammed all day as I saw it. 4 stars because they should clean the wash water a little more often."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Love this place!  I used to go to a competitor, but they offer a much better value and for a better price!  A subscription for an all around wash, windows, and everything else is about the same price as a basic subscription elsewhere.  The staff is always friendly, and they take good care of me!  Grace at the counter is especially nice!

I just had a 360 wash...I now regret having gotten the subscription only for a 180...the 180 is a great value, but the 360 is mind boggling!  They didn't detail the car, but it's not alk that far short of it!  I'm upgrading!

A+!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,took my 2010 Tahoe in for service like I have for the last 6 years the place is different since Gram sold to Buinnin it has gone down hill Jerry from service called and told me how much it would be and what I need to do he said to replace the Cabin filter because there would be ash from the fire in it and they did and charge me $89 one big problem there is no cabin air filter in a 2010 Tahoe these guys are a rip off avoid this place I am sure they have sold stuff in the past to me that did not get done.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"So I thought that the pressure in my tires kept leaking due to the constant weather changes. I thought there was a leak but I obviously don't know now how to fix it. So I went to Yarnall's garage. 

Also, I was due for an oil change. I got a beautiful  synthetic oil change, and they diagnosed where the leak was coming from and fixed it. 

Do you need something fixed and quick? Do you feel like laughing a little bit? Do you feel hungry? Give them a damn call or visit them. 5 stars for speed & service, 5 stars for personality, and 5 stars for restaurant recommendations!"
Automotive,1.5,OR,Do not go here!  The only thing worth going here for is warranty work but even that is a pain. The service department doesn't really know what they are doing. I always have to wait forever for anything to be done. They tell you on the phone it will only take a few minutes for them to look at your car and then when you get there they say it will take hours. I don't know about new cars but the used cars they sell are way overpriced and they do not look them over before reselling them. This place is terrible.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had an exceptional experience with Hartmann's Towing this evening.  My car was hit by another driver and totaled. I was quite shaken and upset. The tow truck driver, Steve, arrived promptly after I called.  He was incredibly kind and friendly and really, the only good part of the whole situation. He not only gave me a ride home before taking my car to the auto body shop (which I know is standard practice), but he also helped me empty all of the stuff out of my car into my garage!  The police officer at the scene mentioned this company, and I'm so glad I found them."
Automotive,2.5,OR,Took my vehicle in for leaking fuel which was a bad fuel pump.  Paid 600 plus for the repair.  Within 100 miles my check engine light came on.  I don't drive this vehicle much so it has been a couple of months.  Turns out it was a broken rollover valve on top of the tank which was obviously broken when they replaced the fuel pump.  The manager denied having any responsibility for it and came up with multiple lame excuses. I had to pay another 800 plus for a used gas tank. Very dishonest. Stay away from this brake masters. They will rip you off!
Automotive,4.5,OR,Back in August of 18' we had stopped in this location for an estimate on breaks for my daughters vehicle. Being that we just moved her into the area from California for her first year at college we had very little knowledge of the area. I spoke to Markees about what was needed. He set up a free estimate and got back to us shortly with the estimate. It was reasonably priced and included a few minor things he had noticed as well. We went ahead and had them perform the work and I could not be happier with how they performed and took care of my daughter.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Justin Sorrentino took the time to show me several cars that I might be interested in. After making a decision on which car I wanted, Justin explained the next steps in the buying process.  He then introduced me to James Mack who handled the remaining part of my purchase. James spent over an hour explaining all of the cars features and ensuring I was comfortable operating them. Everyone that I encountered while I was at the dealership to include Justin, James, Harry Snyder and Marsha (who did my paperwork) were all wonderful! The entire purchase went very smoothly. I love my new car and would definitely recommend this dealership."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Came here after trying to go to Midas for an oil change and tire rotation. Midas was a hot mess, there were 9 cars ahead of me even tho I had an appointment, and the men who worked there were rude and made me feel uncomfortable. This place is the total opposite! Everyone here was really friendly, and when they gave me all the options for oils and filter changes, I didn't feel at all pressured to pick the most expensive thing. I just felt respectfully educated about my options. And the service was super fast, even tho there were two people ahead of me. I'll def be back here!"
Automotive,1.5,CG,Avoid this place.  I had an appointment with them and was told by my service advisor that the shuttle would be there the next day.  I called the next morning to find out where the shuttle was and no one answered the phone.  I called again and was told that they would be there within 2 hours.  I called back the next day and was told that they had not received any calls.  I called again the next day and was told that the shuttle would not be there for me until the following day.  I was told that
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I've always stopped by Reedman Toll to get an oil change.  

The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I've never had to wait long before a oil change is completed.  

The waiting room is clean and well lit with coffee and popcorn.  I always get a great deal on the oil change.  I've had to wait a bit longer than I was originally told but I think I've had good experiences here.  I'll continue to come here for my oil changes.I've been going to"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Well update now, I got a call from the owner saying that he was going to fix the issue. He said that the problem was not his problem and that he would be fixing it. The problem was fixed and the problem was fixed. The problem was fixed and I was back on the road. I'm not a fan of dealerships, but I felt like I was being treated fairly. I was very disappointed with the service I received and the customer service I received from both of these guys was very disappointing. I hope the manager has a manager,"

He was very knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to work with. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car.The staff was friendly and helpful.

Automotive,4.0,CG,"I purchased my sisters 2012 Mercedes GLK 350 from these guys. My wife and I have purchased many Mercedes's over the years, and have never had a problem. In fact, we have had our cars serviced at a dealership for years. The service has always been thorough and thorough. They have never tried to sell me unnecessary items on my car, which is very nice when I have to ask them to do an oil change. We are very happy with our Mercedes GLK350 and will continue to do so."
Automotive,2.5,CG,Dreadful service. They were supposed to fix the problem and they did not. When I got home the check engine light was on and I went to the dealer to get a refund. I was told it was a loose transmission. I took it to a dealer and was told it was a loose transmission and a bad transmission. I will never go back there. I had to wait 3 months for a part to come in to install a part that was supposed to be in a week. The mechanic was very friendly and helpful.
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Wrote down an offer on a new car with a quote of $3,000. 00 and we went down the street to the dealership. The car was advertised on the website and was listed as a ""free"" oil change. We drove around with our two young kids and found the vehicle listed as a ""free oil change"". The salesman then told us that if we could get a free oil change, they would charge us $35. 00. I told him that we were not interested in buying the car."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Dirt Stripper is a self-serve car wash, with a comfortable waiting area. There is a vacuum station. There are several suds and a couple of choices to choose from. The vacuums are a little hard to get to, but they have some of the best suction in the area. They have a nice selection of accessories, including the $5 wash. There is also a deluxe wash for the most part. I am happy with the wash, and will be going back in the future."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I came into Sloane Toyota and asked if they could help me out. They said yes and said they would get back to me. I went to get the car and the same day, they had not even started on it. I was told it would be ready by the end of the day. I waited and waited. I was told by the woman who was helping me that I could go get my car. When I got there, the lady told me that they couldn't start on my car because I needed my car back."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"After having my alternator replaced about a month prior, it appeared to be going out on my drive home from work. I went straight to the closest garage I could find on Google Maps, and thankfully, it was Daniels Auto Repair. Mike Daniels took a quick look at the car, agreed it was likely the alternator, and graciously allowed me to leave my car parked in his lot overnight until a tow truck could arrive to tow it back to Phoenixville, where I'd had it replaced before. Throughout the whole thing, he was kind, gracious, and friendly--to someone who wasn't even a customer. I really, really appreciated his generosity and help."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Ever since I bought my 2012 Sprinter in 2013 I've been very happy with the service I've received. I haven't had any big issues to deal with, just a regular service call. I've stopped by or called with a few questions and their response has always been great. They're super helpful. Just little things like offering to wash my van, topping off my wiper fluid, etc. Things that all dealerships should do but it's the little things that impress. They seem to do it because they want to not because they have to. I've had my vehicle for about 2 years and I'm very happy with the vehicle and the dealership."
Automotive,5.0,OR,Maybe thirds times a charm... but I've been there 2 times for the same injection issue on my jeep. The first time about 170.00 Pretty much all labor so they could test everything the plugs something about tim Bri get to it... said they didn't really now why it was still misfiring... the verdict was for me to put some additive-- fuel cleaner when /if the light came back bring it back--it did so I did. 2nd time they put in a new fuel injector 140 ish ... well next morning lights back on...stay tuned and I will update this review if they actually fix my Jeep (BTW it's a 2012)
Automotive,3.0,OR,Wow I'm so impressed. First time I've ever bought a car and they didn't try to rip me off. I got more than a fair amount for my trade in. Chris Hayden the General Manager and Andrew Dimatteo my salesman really went out of their way to give me everything I asked for. I do so love dickering. lol. They followed through with everything they promised. I got a great interest rate of 3.3 at Ascend Federal Credit Union. I would highly recommend Andrew Dimatteo if your in need of a good used vehicle at a fair price. I can't wait to do business with them again. It was so easy.
Automotive,4.0,OR,Today I had an issue with my car that has 9700 miles on it. Since it is still under warranty and I needed the car to travel on vacation I called the dealer.The dealer showed absolutely no interest in helping. As always North Penn Gulf came through and is fitting me in to their busy schedule. They are by far the best of all service providers that I use. It is great to know that they value your business. This review should have been written long ago since they have been a great help to so many in the North Penn area. Thank you to the great folks at NP Gulf
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Seriously, a huge fan of this place! You literally stay in your car while they change your oil and perform a maintenance check. Last time, I had to do a coolant flush so it took about 20 minutes but most my most recent oil change, I was in and out in 10 minutes. It's incredible! They're speedy, kind, and don't try to rip you off - probably the most important characteristic to look for in a mechanic. You can also find groupons and coupons on their website. My usual mechanic is Monday-Friday, but this place is open 7 days, making it super convenient for someone who works full time."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"WILL NEVER TAKE MY VEHICLE HERE! My boyfriend took his truck in for a brake issue, was told after diagnosis it was the Master Cylinder, which involves replacing and including a flush of the system....still having an issue. Took the truck back in to see what the issue is, comes to find out the master never needed replaced it just needed a flush, WHICH THEY NEVER DID IN THE FIRST PLACE. Not only is he out hundreds of $$$ he now has to take his truck to have the original work completed somewhere else. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE -  RUDE - STEALS FROM CUSTOMERS!!!! Think twice about taking your car/truck here!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"When it comes to gas stations I look for two things: easy entry/exit and overall cleanliness/appearance. This maverik knocks both out of the park. 

Easy access off the roundabout or Veterans, the station offers wide ingress and egress, along with plenty of room to move around to access the pumps, parking air etc. Typically the gas is priced mid-range for the area, and with the added convenience of being close to home and en route to everywhere, it becomes the default. 

The convenience store is pretty packed with options too. They really can fuel your adventure! 

The station is always pretty clean, and during Covid holding that standard is greatly appreciated."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"No white glove service at white glove car wash.  Not only is my car filthy, on the outside, but the inside still has a leaf on the dash and dirty Windows( inside and out), to list a few.  They didn't do express vacuum, window cleaning or even wiping the door frames.  When I tried to talk to a manager about it the employee  drove my car to the business across the way parked it and walked away.   They basically refused to help me at all! Worst customer service I have experienced for a while.  Downingtown, or Exton friends avoid this place like the plague!"

Automotive,3.0,CG,Don't go here. This owner is an absolute crook. I will never ever go there again and will tell everyone I know to stay away. He is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They are rude and will tell you they will fix whatever it takes to fix your car. I had a 2 day rental car and it took them 2 hours to repair it. I had to take it to a different shop and they told me that they didn't have a tech in the area to do the work.

Automotive,3.5,CG,I have been in contact with the service department several times for a recall on my car and every time I get an update. I am not going back to this dealership. They should be fired.I had an excellent experience at Precision Toyota. I was greeted with friendly service and provided the best service I could ask for. I was also able to get the best deal for my car. They even had a shuttle to pick me up from the airport. I will definitely be returning for service from Precision Toyota in the future.I would give this place no stars if
Automotive,4.5,CG,This location is TERRIBLE!! They are an absolute joke! We've been here for 2 weeks and every time we go in the car they tell us they're running out of gas and it's been taking 2 weeks to get in. We've been there for 3 days and still no gas! We had a 2 day rental car and it's been over 3 weeks and we haven't heard anything. They just want to make money off of it! The manager told us that they're not doing anything about it! They don't care about their customers.
Automotive,3.5,CG,"This place is so awesome. We have been going here for years and have always been pleased with the service. If you need a good, quick and honest mechanic, this is the place to go. It's a little pricey, but it is worth it. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was in and out in under an hour and they even gave me a great deal on my tires. They even took the time to go over everything with me. I will be coming back to them again for all of my tire needs."

Automotive,2.0,CG,My husband brought my car here for the first time in two years. My son's car has been running so fine since the first visit. He is a very nice guy who is very nice. They had everything done in a timely manner and it was a very good experience. The staff is always very friendly and they have the most professional staff. I will definitely bring my car back here.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"I've read the other two reviews of this store. My experience was much better. I ordered my tire online and made an appointment for 0930 hrs. I got there 45 mins early and they took my car right in. The waiting area is clean and there's a tv. Plenty of magazines to look through but no coffee. The restrooms were very clean. My tire hadn't been delivered yet, but they took the old one off. The new one arrived at about 0930 hrs, they put it on and off I went. No fuss. No hassle. No up-selling. Exactly as it should be. If they had coffee, they'd have gotten the last star."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This was one of the coolest tours my partner and I did while in New Orleans.  Seeing the floats on television does not compare to the size and detail of seeing them up close.  Plus you get behind the scenes history of Mardi Gras, the float decoration and a taste of King's cake.  You see a 10 minute video, taste some cake then go on a 30 minute guided tour of the warehouse where some floats are in the process of being designed.  We took Lyft to the warehouse which is in the industrial part of town.  The shuttle and driver back to our hotel was cool."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Tried to go to Cottmann for some general repairs as the reviews were very good. They were very busy but kindly referred me to Smiling Chuck's. 
Chuck, the owner was great, highly communitive, knowledgeable, thorough and fast. 
Prices seemed reasonable and the diagnostic was a bit cheaper than a lot of places. During my time on property it appeared that he had a lot of regular clients and knew the folks in the neighborhood. Not once did I feel like I was pulling teeth to get information out of him or that he was ripping me off or b.s.ing me. Left today feeling that they could be trusted, will definitely be returning."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Best airport parking for MSY!

I have used them a few times.  They are the cheapest ($6.50 per day), they have a secure facility, and they pick you up in 5 minutes after you call them.  Very friendly service too!  All the drivers are really nice, helped me with my bags, asked me how my day was...  all that stuff.

SPECIAL NOTE:  When you get back to MSY they pick you up at the Transportation Center.  If you are at the very forward most baggage claim (directly under Southwest), you cross the street go into / under the parking garage and you'll see the sign for Transportation Center."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This company is also known as Newparts, Inc . They sell cheap parts from China on Ebay. I made the mistake of purchasing a blower motor for my vehicle, it failed a short time later. when I attempted to return the item I was told the item was supposed to be installed by a certified mechanic and they required proof. My advise is not to use a company that does not stand behind products they sell (under a different name) if they are doing this to me over a $26 part, imagine what they will do when trusting them with a major repair my advise is to just do a little research"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"UPDATE! 
The manager, Jacob, was incredibly sincere in his apology for the oil lid mistake. They not only repaired the damages to my car and replaced the oil, but they also paid for the tow truck. It was a very frustrating situation that was lessened by the companies dedication to correct their mistake! I am very thankful that Jacob was so willing to work with me. I even received a call today making sure that the car was still running okay!

All in all, it was a rookie mistake that could have caused some serious damage, but the staff and employees at this location were apologetic and incredibly helpful! So thank you, all!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Searching for a mechanic has typically been a stressful experience for me.  I have been overcharged in the past and so has my wife.  I'm glad I convinced her to leave her mechanic as he was the type to throw parts at a problem.  Finally, I discovered Clarks Auto Repair, where I am more than confident in the owner, Ladd's expertise and honest practices.  He has many years of experience and I don't doubt he will continue to grow his customer base.

I recommend this shop and chose to write about it here because I know there are many other people out there who could use a good mechanic."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Not bad.. I saw a great price on a certified used Escape.  Walked in, test drove a few and walked out an our later after buying the one I saw online at the price I wanted. I got decent financing rates too.  

I gave 4 vs 5 stars since I don't think the oil change was actually done as stated.  I think they saw the car had 10k miles and just detailed it vs doing all the certified checks.  I can't say I entirely blame them given the like-new condition but still..

Anyway, it was an easy transaction so I can't ask for much more from a car dealer!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Oh! My! Goodness!

This was by far my favorite part of our trip to New Orleans, and I'm not a huge Mardi Gras person. You get a behind the scenes look at what it all takes to construct a truly unforgettable Mardi Gras float, from start to finish. The tour starts out in the gift shop area where you check in, followed by a brief video in the theater that talks about the history and the process (super informative). Everyone gets a small sample of king cake, and off to the warehouse where the artists are busy at work preparing for the upcoming parade. 

This place is AMAZING; We had such a blast!"
Automotive,1.5,CG,"When you buy a car here, you are going to be in and out in about 45 minutes. I had a great experience at this dealership, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Update:

I came in for an oil change and was given a coupon for a free oil change. I was also told the car was on the rack so I could get it done. I came in to pick it up. The tech came back to tell me that they had to order the parts and the price would be $100."

Automotive,4.5,CG,Talked to Evan two weeks ago to make an appointment. He told me that he would get back to me within an hour. I waited 2 hours and the car was finally ready. I was so excited to drive it out of the bay. I was shocked when Evan called me to tell me that my car was done. I was very impressed with how efficient he was and how he was. I was very pleased with the service I received and will definitely be back. This is a great place to get your car washed. The staff is friendly and helpful.
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Had an appointment, but unfortunately, it took an additional 15 minutes to get my car in. When I called the morning before I got there, they said they didn't have time to look at it. It was a 4:00 appointment. I was still waiting for my car to be seen. I will never go back.

After 30 minutes I was told that my car was finished. They told me it would be about 30 minutes. I paid for the inspection and the car passed inspection.
Automotive,2.5,CG,"A lot of the reviews here say the dealership is a good place to visit, but this one is a complete waste of time.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"I have been using Dennis automotive for sometime now. And they have always done great work. Great people, super friendly and helpful. Mark is always willing to explain things thoroughly and has always been true to his word. I just picked up my current vehicle from the shop and they actually did a few more things (spark plugs, cleaning the fuel injectors etc.) then I was planning on getting done and they were still more reasonable than I was expecting. They always call and make sure I'm OK with what they are going to do before doing it.
I will definitely be using them again when/if I need any sort of automotive work done."
Automotive,3.5,OR,This was a nice car wash and when I went her I had just driven across country so my Toyota needed love badly LOL. I got the $15 loss and I was glad I did it really scrub my vehicle good and it was nice and shiny afterwards . I will definitely be coming back to this location for all of my car washing needs . The vacuum sucked real good and cleaned my interior well . If you don't wanna spend a bunch of money going to the car detailers it seem to be a lot in the area you just want to get in and out this is your place .
Automotive,2.0,OR,This is by far the worst run car agency to ever. This is my second time using this location and both times have been a disaster. I did not write a review on my first bad experience. This experience I have waited for one hour to get my rent a car with one person working. If you are renting in the Tampa area stay away from advantage they are the absolute worst I rented from advantage and many other locations. They were excellent. But this location is unbelievably bad. Its difficult listening to the agent try to upsell every customer that comes up to her while there is a line out the door.
Automotive,2.0,OR,"They sold me a car that they KNEW had multiple MAJOR problems. When I took the car back the next day, i was told the noise I heard was cleaning solvent on the engine and it would burn off and the car was a steal. Thank goodness they insisted I buy the extended warranty ($3600) because I have already fixed an oil leak in the engine and currently my transmission is being replaced. They are hoping the transmission will fix everything I brought it in for. I am talking about over $8000 in repairs already! And they wouldn't even get one star if they werent making me select a rating to post this."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"This is my goto Harbor Freight when I want to pick up something I see in the ad. This is not a big store, so they can be out of items. The quality of their products can be hit and miss - most of the time ok. Prices are excellent - this can be hit and miss also - sometimes you get what you pay for and they don't last too long before they break. I have a few products that I go for such as tarps, light strings, yard items, some light tools that are usually ok. Given the wide variation in quality - I'm giving this a 3 out of 5."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This is an update to my original review. I went back to have an oil change and the technician told me that ""someone""Had over tightened the oil pan drainage nut. I explained that I had only been to them to have my oil changes done but they insisted that they couldn't prove that I hadn't been somewhere else so I had to pay in excess of $500 to replace the oil pan. I guess it could've been worse they could've made me pay for the whole thing but really disappointing that someone I trusted and used exclusively would doubt me. I've since found a new mechanic and feel much better about this service."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Just bought a new Outback and couldn't be happier!  We went to Tom Wood twice.  Dealt with Greg Begley on both occasions. First was to test drive, the second time we drove it again but we already knew it was a great fit for for us. Greg was very knowledge yet low key. We didn't get the typical pressure applied by car salesmen. That was much appreciated. 

Buying process was quick and painless. Started some paperwork, went to lunch, came back and Greg went over the entire car with us before we drove off the lot. 

We would recommend Greg and Tom Wood to anybody interested in joining the Subaru family."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I've been coming here for years and have always been impressed with the professionalism, but this time around was different.  This punk kid had an attitude right off the start and clearly didn't notice my wife in back seat of the truck when he was placing the accelerator bar in place and dropping the F-Bomb and a few other choice words.   I then watched goofy approach a young  lady driving up in the BMW and all of the sudden his demeanor changed. I own 5 cars and a few company cars which i won't bring to this smog station anymore.

It will cost you a lot of money if you don't want to have the vehicle towed.  I have the most common complaint about how the mechanic is a jerk.  I have never had a problem with him.  The only reason I gave a 1 star is because he was very friendly and helpful.  I have been going to him for about a

They were going to charge me $500 for something that I didn't need. This was an all-in-all experience. I will never go to them again.I have never had such a pleasant experience at a car dealership. I came in to look at a couple of cars and a few of the cars that I wanted to see. I was greeted immediately, and the process was explained"
Automotive,4.0,CG,Actual service was good on the phone and the techs were very polite and professional. I would recommend them to anyone.If I could give zero stars I would. I was in a minor accident and had no choice but to take my car to them. I had to get my car towed from a nearby repair shop to the shop because I had to get it back to them. They told me my car had been in a accident and that they couldn't fix it because of the accident. They told me that my car was totaled. I took my car to the

I have had great experiences with this place and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a car. I will be back.I would give a zero if I could.  I went in to get a simple tire fix and they told me my tire had to be replaced.  They told me I needed a new tire and that they could do it for $75.  I walked out of there and got a"
Automotive,5.0,CG,"I picked up my jeep here last week.  The service manager was kind, informative and helpful.  The service dept. was also very accommodating.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.  It was a great experience.I wish I could give negative stars.  I had a very good experience at the dealership.  

I purchased a vehicle from them.  My salesman, Steve, was nice and helpful.  He showed me the vehicle I was interested in.  He gave me the price.  I told him I was"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Unfortunately had to have my car towed there after a minor accident. When I got to the dealership, I was met with a bunch of crap and the car was not fixed. The dealership was extremely rude and when I asked why they were giving me the car back after they repaired the car, they told me I didn't want to pay for the repair. I had already been there when I had the car towed there and they wouldn't fix it until I paid for the repair. I would never recommend going to this dealership."
Automotive,1.5,CG,I had great customer service here. The guys were friendly and professional. They were very thorough and thorough. I felt very comfortable with the process and the work was done in a timely manner. I highly recommend this place.I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service from the people that work here. I've been to several locations over the years and I've never had any issues. I had to have my car serviced on my way to work when I got home from work to get it back. The staff is friendly and helpful and they always let
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I was very excited to have a place to bring my car that was so close to home when I saw that an STS was being built. I scheduled an appointment for 2:00pm and showed up a few minutes prior. I must have hit. Busy time because there was a line of people but Ed was there and took care of me and my car was in the shop and back out within 30 minutes. They did not try to push anything I didn't need like Pepboys typically does which was great too. The staff was patient and welcoming. 

I will be going back for more! $22.22 for an oil change and tire rotation."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Excellent service! I am a college student (not from Tucson) and they treated me with overall respect when I told them the issue with my vehicle, although I didn't purchase it at this Nissan dealership. I've been to other Nissan dealers where they were jerks whenever they asked if I had purchase the vehicle there and I had responded with a ""I'm sorry, I did not."" I had an issue with my vehicle due to a recall and they were able to get me in the very next day. Overall great customer service and respect from their employees. I am definitely going to come back here for anything else I need for my vehicle."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I downloaded this app for the sole purpose of letting everyone know how truly awful this jiffy lube is. Came in 8:30am Saturday. 3 people were in front of me. I needed oil change, tire rotation, and back breaks replaced. It's now 11:30am and I'm still here. They ruined my Saturday and are very expensive for horrendous service. I will NEVER come back here and trash the place to anyone with an ear including people who live in area.

Update the service manager who I never caught his name called me to apologize. I think it was a nice gesture. I remember him from other appointments and he's the biggest asset at that jiffy lube"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"This is my 2nd great review for Nic Wycoff.
Nic did such a great job with our Bahamas trip, I went back to him for our Las Vegas Trip. This was a short notice trip for us, but he was able to get us a great price and a better hotel then what I plan on. Nic is a pleasure to work with and is always very professional.  Nic is a value to your company and should be recognized for his work. As long as you have employees like Nic, you will have a loyal customer with your AAA. As long as Nic is with your company, I will always go back to him."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This is a dysfunctional dealership at best. I was offered a car on Friday, I couldn't pick it up till Monday. I was called Monday morning at 9 am and asked to come pick up the car ... Drove 2.5 hours from margate to the main line. 2 min away from dealership I received a call stating that the car had been sold Friday. I went to the dealership and some bearded red haired guy named mike greeted me and told me that he sold the car to his friend for $450 dollars more than what they promised it to me for ... With a smirk on his face.. No less!!! Over $450 !!!"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"I had test drove a vehicle, waited 2 weeks to make an offer. My offer was accepted on Saturday Dec 4th, a 200$ deposit was left via credit card. I was told that Monday the vehicle would be inspected and I could come claim it. I was called Monday that the car was ready and could pick it up. Upon arrival I was told that the vehicle was sold to someone else and there was nothing he could do. The vehicle was never inspected and my money was returned. Upon leaving I discovered that ALL THE VEHICLES had no inspection stickers or were all weirdly peeling in the same place...fake stickers??? I think so."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"If I could give zero stars I would. 

Came in for a fully synthetic oil change and a guy named Patrick with ""manager"" on his shirt wasn't paying attention and overflowed the entire engine. 

They began explaining that they were going to clean everything up ""the best that they could."" Someone else even asked ""what the problem was."" 

Seems like they really have issues with employees paying attention. No one really knew what they were doing. 

We finally had the actual manager come out who did give us a refund and was the only person to genuinely apologize. 

We will not be back and probably will go with another company over Valvoline any day."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Bought a Rav4 here last month. LOVE my car! My salesman and dealer manager were great. BUT, working through the paperwork with the finance person was painful. Had to reprint the contract 6 times and it still wasn't correct. Wanted me to sign 2 contracts for the same car because he couldn't get the printing correct. I even went to get the manager to help because this man was so incompetent. Now I get a letter from Toyota saying the form still wasn't completed right by Seeger. Such a pain! No trust in this finance dept at all. We were in the market for a second car but went elsewhere because of this experience."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"We went to see Larry Persons about a particular SUV we had been in the market for.   Larry immediately did some searching and found us the 'top of the line' model (VW Tiguan) with all of the options, it was a corp lease return and he was able to get it for us at over $10,000 of the 'new' price, this one had less than 1,000mi on it!

Super easy to deal with, straightforward, and no bs.  I am actually looking forward to my next car shopping experience because I know I can not only trust Larry, but I also know he will find what I am looking for.  Highly recommended."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"It was fast indeed, and they are able to renew your registration online-BUT they do not issue the registration and tags. When I asked if the registration service was the same as at the AAA, the service Provider said yes- it's not. I expected to get the tags and registration card as I would have from AAA. When I realized that was not the case, I asked them to reverse the charge on my card so I could go to AAA, my request was refused. I now will have to drive with expired tags on a multi- state trip. I am more than disappointed in the lack of clarity when sold the registration service."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"My wife and I purchased a CX-9 from Nucar back in March. Our experience was excellent from start to finish. I highly recommend salesperson Mike Johnson, who provided a competitive up-front quote over email, great communication throughout the sales process and even came in on a morning off to accommodate our schedule. No other dealer was able to beat their price. I felt at ease through the entire process. They even found a quiet space for my wife to nurse our infant at once point. Give Nucar a look if you are interested in a Mazda or need service. I'll be back even though it is a bit of a drive."
Automotive,2.0,CG,I paid for the $15.95 car wash and they did a horrible job. I went through the wash and the car was still dirty. The manager said he didn't have time to clean it and had to call him back in a few hours. This was an excellent experience. I would recommend this car wash to anyone!They are terrible. I made an appointment for an oil change. I was told it would take about an hour to an hour. I arrived at 9:30am and was told it would take about an hour. I waited until 2:30
Automotive,3.5,CG,"After driving my car with a dead battery, the battery was dead. I called the dealership and spoke with an employee who said the battery was fine and the car was fixed. I was so happy to hear this and be safe driving it. I wish I had read the reviews before I drove it. I will never go to this dealership again.I have been to a lot of car washes in town, but I have to say that they do a great job. I have been coming here for years, and I have never had a problem. They do a thorough job"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Courteous, professional, speedy. I have been coming here for over 15 years now. Always a pleasure to deal with. If you want to get your car fixed right the first time, go see Chris. He's a great guy. I will always recommend him. I will be back. I would give a zero if I could. I went in to have a tire plugged and I was told it would take about an hour to an hour to patch. I arrived at 4:30 and was told that it would take about an hour."

Automotive,1.0,CG,"WARNING!!!!!!
DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM HERE!!!

I've been going to this car wash for years. Every time I get a wash and then have a clean car, it's free. I mean, I know I'm paying for the basic wash. If you have a clean car, it's free!  I'm not sure if it's a basic wash or a wash. This time I paid for the $19. 99 wash. I got the $2. 99 wash for $3. 99."
Automotive,1.5,CG,Literally the biggest run around here. The guys here are all rude and unprofessional. I just wanted a simple oil change and I was out of there in 30 minutes. They were so nice and honest. I will be back in a heartbeat.I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely helpful and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to get my car serviced. I will recommend them to anyone I know!I recently purchased a brand new Tacoma from Chapman Ford and have had nothing but problems with the service department.  They lied about what
Automotive,4.0,CG,I recently had an issue with my car.  I was told by my insurance company that the car would be taken care of.  I took the car to the body shop and it was fixed.  The car was fixed in a matter of two hours and I was back on the road.  The repair was quick and I was able to get the car back to the body shop.  My car looks amazing and I can't tell you how much it looks like.  The body shop did an amazing job on the car.  I will definitely be back. 
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I have been using this location for the last two years for all my oil changes and tire rotations.  The prices are reasonable, and they're quick and efficient.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"We brought our van in due to overheating. Brian was easy to work with and told me exactly how they would handle getting the car situated. He called exactly when he said he would and provided an in depth diagnosis. He even explained and showed how the pricing was determined. The amount of the repairs was fair and they even provided financing options. That was a great perk considering it was also time for a mortgage payment. Flexible, fast, transparent, and courtesy are the words I would use to describe Gary's.  To top it all off they're guest rewards card has some pretty awesome perks that'll make getting our 3 cars serviced less bothersome."
Automotive,4.5,OR,I have been going their for years until they charged me for a oil change they never did. A month after the oil change my oil change sensor came on. I figure the sensor went bad because I just changed the oil. Couple months go by. My engine died because their was no oil in it. I called them and as I the customer was crying on the phone because now I have no way to work or any transportation the owner continued to get smart with me on the phone. I thanked him for destroying my car and he had the nerve to say your welcome. Don't go their if you value your car.
Automotive,2.5,OR,"This place fell off in a BIG way. I don't know if they changed management or staff or what, but my new car has some scratch marks from the wash now and it never comes out clean like it used to. And how hard is it exactly to put receipt paper in the two kiosks? I haven't gotten a receipt here without asking for the past 3 times I got it washed. So here I am now with scratches on my car and no receipt...I always liked the prices and ease of pete's automated system, but I think their days are over at this location. Stay far far away, especially if you value your car!!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,Went with my family & parents. Need to buy a ticket for kids 2 & up. Check Groupon or Living Social for discounted tickets. You will need to pay for parking which it about $20. Tour comes with 15 min video going over history of Mardi Gras & float making. The live tour starts with king cake tasting and then a walk through the warehouse where floats are made. I'm from the area so much of the history I knew but there were things I learned too. Great first spot if you've never been to NO. They give you all the time to walk around the warehouse after your tour so book early tour time.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"First time coming here for a car wash. I did the ""the works"" wash which was $18 and included exterior wash, windows, interiors, tire shine and what not. The exterior wash was okay, miss some dirty spots around my car. Interior part, they also missed a couple spots when wiping around my dash area. Now as far as where my tires and rims go, it was pretty bad. No tire shine whatsoever and my rims were still dirty. I had to go home and just do it myself. This place is good only for just a quick basic exterior wash. They clean it really fast (25-30 mins) but they don't pay attention to the details."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Discount tires has never disappointed me on both tire prices and services.  You can always get the best deal on tires and if they don have it, they will get it. Everyone at every location has always been awesome and sweet. Recently I went in for a tire rotation. I called first and the service guy recommended an appt which I agreed since it was a free service and no one wants to do something they're not getting paid for. Luckily when I came in, it I was really slow so they took me in and I was out in less than 20 minutes. I recommend this place over any tire shop in tucson."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I've been having Brian detail my vehicle for a while now. We met through the Living Social Deal awhile back. He is so kind, professional & courteous. Brian will go detail your car on the spot. He does a great job love how my car looks like new again! I keep telling him though you need a carpet shampoo'er for your van ;-) that's the only thing he can't do on the go. For the price though you can't be beat plus now that it's warm out I can do my own mats at home. You won't regret sending your car to Brian! He is someone I feel like I can trust with my vehicle!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,I chose the wand wash to wash my Not so dirty truck. Not too happy about paying for time before I start washing. That's an extra minute per customer and that's just crooked. The lighting was so bad that when another car came in with it's daytime running lights on I was briefly able to see where I missed. The antique mercury vapor lights haven't seen new bulbs in years and it shows......or doesn't show. The only positive note was it had hot water rinse. After $22 my truck still looked dirty. There was hardly any evidence that soap was being drawn into the sprayer. It's the only $22 they will ever get from me.
Automotive,3.5,OR,Went to this place a week ago and purchased a 16 tlx. I bought the car certified and thought I was buying a decent car. Turns out a 30k Acura drives like a 2k beater. I have nothing but vibrations from the vcm system even though I'm told it's normal it's the worst car iv ever driven. To make matters worse these crooks said nothing about this when purchasing. They also are not willing to let me exchange the vehicle for something else even though it's been 4 days. Now after a week of owning the car I absolutely hate it. Stay away from Acura in general the quality has gone way down in years.

Automotive,1.5,OR,"This place has average one star for a reason. Staff are rude to customers. They bitch at you for not cleaning out everything (and I mean everything when I spent 30 minutes cleaning out my car to make detailing easier for them). And they still bitched me out for one or 2 things left in the car. If I wanted to detail and clean my own car, I could do that myself. And then I leave it for 3. 5 hours and come back 30minutes After the scheduled time and I'm told I will be another 30 minutes and they don't care I have an appt to get to. This place won't get my business again."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"On July 06 2017 I brought my car in for my 6 month check up. I was directed to the Blue team  his name is Wonderson Huynh, Service Advisor. He sat me down and explained everything they are going to do and sat there and answered all my questions. That is a first for me. Although I have never had a problem with the teams in the past, Wonderson went above and beyond the call of duty.and next time I go there that's my man. The car dealership I have going to for several years is a great place to buy a car. They stand behind what they sell. That's what is important to me!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"My go-to spot these days for oil changes, tires & minor-ish repairs.   Really great customer service keeps me loyal, especially from Ashley.   She's the best & always willing to help you out finding parts and suggesting fixes within your budget.   I never feel pressured to get repairs done & they will tell me what can wait versus what really needs to get done.   I super appreciate that.   Are they the world's best?   Nah... but they are a very nice shop I can depend on for regular maintenance and repairs.   Stay local folks.   Forget the Jiffy Lube and corporate tire places!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had never heard of this company before, but my mom broke down on her way to work. I called Geico (great insurance btw) and they called Action Towing for us. We were quoted 53 minutes (very specific lol) which we were prepared for because towing companies need time. So we waited for them, fully prepared to not be there because we were going to drive my mom to work. They ended up showing up a whole half hour EARLY. Which is crazy, never have i ever known a towing company to ever be early. The guy was great, efficient, and kind. Got the car to our house and this company wasnt a headache whatsoever. Amazing."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Came in looking for a new Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Alejandro took good care of me.  Showed me 4 different options and did a great job shooting me straight on everything.  Alongside with Hector in finance, they got me into a brand new 2017 Limited Edition Grand Cherokee at an affordable rate.  Hector worked within my numbers and got me in the car.  If you have a reasonable budget, they WILL get you into the Jeep you want.  They are a dream team.  I loved the experience, my girlfriend loved the experience and I love the new Jeep even more.  Would buy from them again, absolutely.  Highly recommend."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Excellent customer service! Brought my 2012 ISF in for 35,000 scheduled maintenance. Got an appointment on a Saturday at 10:15 AM. I was promptly greeted upon arriving at the service drop off queue. After about 5 minutes in the waiting room, a service consultant brought me into one of the offices and reviewed the services that would be performed. I was in and out of the dealership in about 1 hr 15 mins! It is a very nice and clean facility with friendly staff. Will definitely return and possibly purchase a vehicle from here in the near future. They also did a nice job washing my car as it had been neglected for quite some time."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"We used this service to park our car at the airport. We had a bad experience with Payless Parking. We called when we got in and was told driver would be there in 10 minutes. Thirty minutes later in the freezing cold we called again. Driver finally showed up. They have no idea of driver location when they tell you 10 minutes. Our driver confirmed that they did not contact him when we called initially. 
We had to walk around the parking lot full of ice to find our car. Not like the facilities that drive you to your car. 
Will never use them again even for a steep discount. There are better businesses out there."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Twelve years ago my car had an unexpected problem and my neighbor recommended that I call Daniels Auto.  I would not have known about them otherwise since they do not advertise.  They don't need to.  Nick and Mike Daniels are possibly the most knowledgeable, friendly, caring, and honest mechanics you could ever possibly meet.  Since that first repair so many years ago, we have never taken any of our vehicles anywhere else.  They have advised us when we buy new cars, they have kept our oldest cars running great, and they have leaped to our aid after hours.  In short, you won't find a better place to take your car."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Sadly for me, I've moved from Ardmore and can no longer easily walk to Milano's to drop off my car. But for the many years I've used them, there is no better repair shop to be found as far as honesty, personality, and price. If they can't do it, they'll tell you. If it will be expensive, they'll warn you. If you have another option, they'll fill you in. You'll typically need to take emergencies elsewhere as they have a small staff and are usually booked a week in advance but there's good reason or that.

I've recommended Milano's to a few friends and all have been very pleased with their experience. You should do the same."
Automotive,3.5,OR,Do not go to the store the customer service is horrible and they will do things to sabotage your car. I would not recommend this store to anybody even if your car was broke down on the side of the road and they were the only people there to pick you up. do not go there! The first time I had an issue I assumed they had my best interest in mind. I did go back the second time and now this is the third time my car was sabatagoed! Each time I have had to take it to another trusted car place to make sure I was not crazy. and they sure confirmed what I thought.
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Honestly, one of the worst customer service experiences ever.  I will never ever go back to this dealership.  I had a bad experience with the dealership, and I'm sure it's because of the fact that I was treated like a waste of my time and my time.

They kept saying it's a good car. I was told it was a lot of money. I told them I wanted it and they said I didn't want to come back. They offered to give me a ride to the dealership to go get the car. I said I'm not going to come back because I'm a woman. I said I'm not going to be here

But they warned me about the long wait and you see them working to take care of all their customers. They kept me updated when they realized I needed a new tire so nothing was a surprise when I went to pay. They close at 6 pm and they were still working on their long line of customers when I left almost an hour after that.

Arrow rebuilt the Transmission at 234,000 miles. 146,000 Miles ago...  (GM 4L60E). 1. Arrow rebuilt it with competent mechanics. 2. The parts used for the rebuild are of excellent quality. 

I exceed the Manufacturer's maintenance recommendations, and have it fully flushed (not drained) with a new filter.   The key is to ""Exceed"".  The proof is evident, my transmission still shifts perfectly and is smooth.

Great Job Arrow."

My cousin can't even sell it!  Management was rude, dismissive and refused to help in any way even though this was their fault! They are the ones who painted it! Ironic that the warranty just expired!... Now they can do whatever they want! This is appalling! 
They essentially are liars, thieves, and insanely unprofessional! There are far too many dealerships to use for a car purchase so avoid this one at all cost (or it will end up costing you more than you ever expected)!!"

His fees are reasonable and fair and he typically works from his own shop/home where he has the most access to his necessary tools. I have no hesitation in recommending his work to others.

Recently just heard of this yelp thing...and instead of the normal bashing and negative Nancy's that get key board courage and just destroy anyone possible, I would rather write about the great experiences I have at places.

The driver gave my bag to the wrong passenger before I got off. The parking attendant did nothing to try and help us find the women or find out her name. After waiting for 30 minutes for the manager he proceeded to tell us that ""this was not his problem/fault"" 
excuse me? 
YOUR employee gave my bag to a total stranger and this is not your problem? 

Finally got to the point where I asked the manager what is name is and he responded ""I'm not telling you my name"" 

Nonexistent customer service and they don't take responsibilities for their actions. Will never use this service again and I advise everyone to find another parking lot."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I was pretty impressed by the service here at O'Rielly Collision Center. It's a little hard to find but you enter from the Sears side of the lot to get to the office. Because they have an Enterprise on the lot it was extremely seamless to drop my car off and pick up my rental. However, keep in mind you might wait a bit to get helped if you drop it off on a Monday morning. Not five stars because I had to bring my car back because the odometer was turned off, so that was a little irksome, but overall a good experience. I worked with Walter who was thorough, and followed up frequently with me."

I've had to return defective parts to this one several times and every single time I've been given the 3rd degree about it (sorry but radiators should NOT leak out of the box.). 

And to top it all off I've had a clerk try to talk down to me like don't know what I'm doing (former mechanic here!) ARGH!

Automotive,4.0,OR,Travis and T.j. Are awesome. I was recommended here by a friend and let me tell you when I say these are the most Honest mechanics I know and they get the job done in a timely fashion. On top of that I have a German car and a lot of mechanics take advantage of that and tend to charge more for labor but not these guys. My parts run a bit more but they blow me away every time I bring my car and they charge me Honda prices. Awesome guys and I save a ton of money. By far the best quotes and quality work to back it up. You got a customer for life fellas.

From the moment you walk in you know you're in good hands and you will leave out that door happy. You can tell this place has a lot of great pride, and the Owners are such loving friendly people. I have trust issues with people working on my car but now that I know RDW Auto is here locally, I will bring my car only here to get serviced. This place does a lot of different unique work. I can't wait to have more work done here. Staff is absolutely great. Best customer service. Thanks Ron & Dianna!"

I mentioned to the lady how long I was on hold and she brought up the fact that I was 22 days late on my payment in a rude way.

I can see why they have a 2 star rating on Yelp which is pathetic for a business. 

Next time I will do more research and do business with a company in the same state I live in cuz I feel like they might be a little bit better at doing business and try to provide more professional customer service and politeness."

They went the extra mile so that I could get it over the weekend, preventing me from having to take public transportation. they called me every few days with updates- just to tell me that my car would be finished when they had originally said it would be finished.

They gave me a courtesy car from the dealership. They keep me car for three days. The dent was repaired in their body shop. The thumping sound was due to three but bolts that were screwed back in with the threading being stripped. That was fixed also. I was charged for nothing regarding the repairs, and my vehicle was returned to me with a full tank of gas three days later.

I told the clerk I'd made an appointment, he said, ""Oh really? You should have said something! Who did you talk to?"" Apparently they do not keep an appointment log or abide by it.

Finally arrived at the dealership at 3:50 only to have Miles shake his head with no reply to anything!!! Please, if you have to have a recall done in your vehicle, find another dealership. Or at least don't have anything to do with Miles."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"BEWARE of the most criminal dealership in the state of Florida. The service department will deceive you every which way possible and charge you a kings ransom to repair the problem. In my case, they charged me a fortune and did not repair the issue. Then had the nerve to say it was a different problem then the initial problem and needed to charge me another diagnosis fee and $2000 for the repairs. This is on top of the $1500 I initially paid. I'm not one to post bad reviews about anyone but these people are pure criminals who dont care about you except your money. Do yourself a huge favor and stay away! You will thank me later."
Automotive,4.5,OR,Salesmen Mike Hazel has become my whole families go to guy. He goes the extra mile and has always been so patient. When were looking for cars to fit our needs we call him for advice. At the dealership he makes us feel welcome and takes the time to answer all our questions. Collectively I think we've owned every car out there and we all agree Acura has the best quality for your dollar and safety needs. If you can find the right car shop like I have with the Boise Acura Shop like I did your life gets that much easier. They have been so awesome I never forget them around Christmas time. That should tell you alot.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"So glad that someone told me about Suncoast! I happened to see that my rear tire was completely shredded and decided to try them. 

They were busy, but they managed to get me in and out relatively quickly. They changed my tire and checked psi on my other tires, which were ridiculously low. After filling the tires, they checked my sway bar links at my request and the whole service was cheaper than the last two no-frills tire replacements I had at other shops!

They are really knowledgeable and very honest and helpful. They were recommended to me again by a local company that I deliver for. 

Best experience I've had with a mechanic/auto repair shop since moving to Florida!"

     Jon took a lot of time finding a wheel that would fit our car,and look good. The prices aren't the lowest in town but the service made up for it. I personally don't mind paying a little more,if I'm being treated well,and we were. I watched Jon interact with other customers, and he took the time with everyone to make them feel important. If your spending your hard earned money on wheels,tinting,or oil changes, give them a try."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"My last two experiences with service with Reedman toll have been infuriating. Most recently they scheduled me for a cleaning for my car, and when I showed up, with my husband and our 2nd car so he could drive me home, they told me they no longer were able to offer it because the company that does the cleaning 'up and left a few weeks ago.' A call would have been nice to save me the hassle, and time of driving all the way to the service center. No one apologized, and instead I was made to feel bad. This is my second leased car with Reedman toll, and when this lease is up, I am considering changing dealerships."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Pressure sales tactic when they know that you're interested in one of their product. But once they have your money, they are slow to respond. Don't let them suckering you into leaving a deposit as they will hold onto it as long as you can and once you leave the deposit you lose dealing leverage and you will likely get stuck into trying to buy something else in their inventory -- even if it's not the one you want. The worst of all, if you want your deposit back, they take 3% out when returning it. Make sure you do not leave a deposit and NEVER let them pressure you into thinking they are giving you a super deal."

Automotive,3.0,CG,"if you have a truck that has been serviced in the past, this is the place to go. 

If you have a Jeep, the service department is great, especially Brian. He is personable and knows his stuff. He is also very friendly and gives you the run around. 

One time I had a problem with the airbag recall on my vehicle. I called them and they got me in right away. They told me that I needed new tires and it would take about an hour and a half. I said no problem. I was just in a rush to"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I've been extremely pleased with every experience I've had with this location so far. I bought a car from RJ who made it fun and personable. He was very helpful with choosing my maxima because he loved the car so much himself. He showed me a million different ones until I finally chose which one I wanted. He was helpful and was always there to answer any questions I had.
The parts and service department has also been a pleasure to deal with. Always friendly and have made all the extra parts I wanted stress free to order for me. I've never waited for long at all for any service either. Over all I'm super happy and would recommend to anyone."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Let me start by saying this was my first time ever shopping for a car. Needless to say, I was excited but obviously pretty nervous... From what I've heard car shopping isn't always the greatest experience for some people. Everyone I encountered at Dimmit was very professional and made me feel super comfortable! Jake was my salesman and he did an awesome job answering all of my questions (including not laughing at the dumb ones!). I also want to thank Eric and Abe for being so friendly and professional! It truly was an easy and stress free experience, and I seriously could not be happier with my new car!! I highly recommend dimmit to anyone looking for a new car!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I want to commend General Manager Chris Fowle and his team at Precision Tune on Charlotte Pike (Nashville).   My car broke down close to his establishment this week and he came out to inquire if he could help.  He ran a diagnostic and accurately identified my problem. There was never any pressure, just a helpful and professional manner.  Their crew had me back on the road within an hour!  I was extremely impressed with their professionalism, helpful attitude and expertise.  Even though I live 30 miles away in Mt. Juliet, I will return to Precision Tune Auto Care for my car repair needs.  Thank you to Chris and his team!  Vikki V."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Please, don't waste your time going to this office; unless you have all day EVERYDAY to do such errands.  The civil service personal lack civil servant qualities and really don't care when you get serve; because they are getting paid and when it's your turn to do your requirements to be compliant to the laws of the state you better cater to them otherwise you'll be wait another 2-6 hours the following day.  In addition, the salt to the wounds are your paying them to be wasting your time and your taxes are paying for such lack luster civil services.  I would find another small OMV or better yet go online to for all your DMV issues."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I got my car serviced here.

The mechanic called me and told me he couldn't  do the service as discussed because of certain issues- Fair enough. They still charged the amount they quoted initially. 
The worst part is they damaged my tire to the point that it went flat on the drive home. I had noticed the low pressure light before leaving but since this was after hours there was no one to show it to. On the way I stopped and saw that the tire was completely flat.  Had to go to another mechanic who told me SOMEBODY had screwed around with the pressure monitoring system.
The phone rep was very hostile.   
Use at your own risk"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I recently purchased a Certified Pre-Owned Q5. I was pleased with their sales approach, which was not the typical rhetoric you receive at many dealerships. The pricing was better than other dealers, and logistics were completed quickly and with a smile.  

As others have mentioned the showroom is impressive. It's very clean with a nice waiting lounge and beverage bar (water, coffee). The lot is very large, so there's a good chance of finding the right CPO or new vehicle.  

This is a nice family run business that so far has provided excellent service. I haven't taken the vehicle for service yet, but walking through their service department left the impression of a very clean and efficient shop."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Called dealership night before to discuss vehicle on website. Made appointment to see between 12:00 and 1:00. They called around 9:30 next morning to confirm. Arrived at 12:15 to have Buddy tell me car was sold 1/2 hour prior. Would not expect them to hold car but certainly would expect a call given Buddy knew we were an hour each way. Car was parked in front of front door of dealership. Therefore Buddy was either oblivious to sale in front of him or thought he could hustle me on another car. Lost two hours of my life, unnecessarily because of his ineptness or his duplicity. Wonder why so many sales are going straight to internet and doing away with salesmen?"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I have been coming to Ken's Automotive for 3 years now.  They are always friendly, fast and reliable.  In addition, their prices have always been fair and unlike other automotive shops I have been to, I never feel like they try to sell me services I don't need.  These guys know what they are doing, are extremely professional and run an excellent business.

I am pretty much appalled by Xi A.'s review commenting on Ken's broken English.  I have the utmost respect for Ken coming to a new country, learning a new language, and starting a successful business the provides a valuable service to our community.  Thank you Ken - you and your employees are amazing!!"
Automotive,2.5,CG,I usually don't write reviews. But this was the worst experience I have ever had buying a car. I bought a used car from this dealership. The first car was advertised on the website and was sold to me by the salesman. I was told it was a $500 purchase. I was also told it was a $500 purchase. I went back to the sales manager and was told the car was still available. When I asked why it was on the website he told me I had to drive it to the dealership for a test drive. I asked why he had to drive the car to the dealership
Automotive,4.5,CG,I had a mishap with my tire and they fixed it for free. When I got home the front tire was leaking air and I had to have it replaced. They fixed it for me free of charge. They were honest and honest. I will always come back. I would give a zero if I could. I went in to get a simple tire fixed and the guy there was rude and rude. I was told they didn't have a tire in stock. I told them I had a flat and they said I could get one at a time.
Automotive,4.0,CG,We had an instance where we had the car towed in for a safety inspection. I was told by a mechanic that the car would be ready by the end of the day. I was told it was ready by the end of the day. I was then told that the car would not be ready until the following day. I was also told that the car was not ready until the following day. I went to pick up the car and was told that the car was not ready until the following day. I was told that the car had been in the shop for about a week and was not ready to be

They do a great job and are friendly.  They're always honest about what is going on with my car.  They don't try to sell you stuff you don't need and they don't try to upsell you.  I've been to a few times where they told me that I needed new tires, and when I got my car back, they told me that they had gotten a lot of life out of it"

I went to this Auto Zone today after my check engine light came on on my drive home.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and asked if I needed assistance.  I let them know I needed the codes pulled from my check engine light and it was that easy!  The employee who helped me, Thomas, was quick and thorough in explaining why the light came on and what I needed to do to fix it.  I was in and out in less than 5 minutes!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,ANOTHER problem.  They put on the back tires of my car and I blew one out.  Bought road hazard insurance through them and they now say that they don't carry the tire.  Two servicemen have told me this.  Spoke to the store manager who needs some Customer Service 101 classes.  STILL not sure when I will get my car back.  Note:  The front tires were put on elsewhere (I blew out a front and back tire in the same day).  The small Mom & Pop Goodyear tire place (McGee's in Zephyrhills) has the front tire already...said they can get a back tire by tomorrow.  Pepboys is not interested in getting their assistance.
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Probably the worst HAN ever. Sparks was slow, again. GRS was a cluster F*. Even after spending a ton money for rooms, we could not find a parking spot for our registered classic car just about any time or any day. They have over-registered participant cars. Stay way from GRS. People staying at every hotel and motel for miles come and park their cars days before and leave them here. After 28 years of supporting them we have reached our limit with the HAN organization with their handling of GSR, the downtown cruise (get those unregistered cars OUT OF THERE SOONER not just after an hour of blocking traffic) and over registration.
We'll go back to Sparks and hopes it comes back."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"So I brought my bmw here a few weeks ago to get an alignment. I thought they did a great job, up until this morning when I opened my hood.  I found that my strut mount had been ground down to the metal and a bolt had been sheared off on the driver side, because they were obviously to lazy to do it properly.  Funny thing is, I happened to change my oil a week earlier and took a picture of under the hood, and looking back on it there are no grind marks.  How funny.  Easy to screw up a completely flawless car. Save yourself and your car and go somewhere else.  See picture attached."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I visited this location the do an oil change.  During the process, they stripped the oil plug from my oil pan which I didn't discover until 6 months later when I did another oil change.  It cost me $800 to replace plus another $150 for a rental car while the part was ordered.  Jiffy Lube REFUSED to pay for this because they said their service was only guaranteed for 3 months.  Well guess what?  This wasn't ""service"", this was you damaging my car and refusing to take responsibility for it.  If I had taken it anywhere else, I wouldn't be out almost $1K.  Never go to Jiffy Lube ever again...I implore all of you!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I have to speak on the AMAZING customer service I've received from this location alone.  I came in obviously a few hundred miles ago and again with the awesome customer service however the up keep and waiting area looked like it hadn't been cleaned in forever and the bathroom was dirty ( more than a car shop bathroom dirty lol ) and no coffee offered , it just wasn't inviting at all . HOWEVER today is a COMPLETE turn around. It's nice and clean inside ( clean for a car shop ) and fresh coffee smelled good and it was a nice experience AND they ALWAYS do an amazing job ! If you haven't been here your missing out !!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I've just used Ray's Auto Body for the first time, after ""interviewing"" two other highly rated shops.  I was impressed from the start by Steve's professional and caring approach.  This experience carried through in all aspects - getting a quote, scheduling the work, and the repair work itself.  Everything was done as discussed, with no surprises or extra costs.  To top it off, the cost was very competitive - due in part to a bit of extra work by Steve to buy just the parts needed, whereas other shops took the ""easy"" way in buying whole assemblies where just one part was required.  I'll definitely use them again and refer others that need auto body work!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,Glad I found a mechanic I can trust. The employees here are really nice and professional. I came in to get an oil change new tires and new brakes because I started to hear some noises when braking. They informed me that I don't need new brakes and explained to me what the noise was. I feel like had I taken it somewhere else they would have just replaced my brakes and I would've been out more money. They don't just fix it because you think it's broke. They tell you what's really up. I appreciate the honesty and I will always bring my car here for any problems or maintenance. Thanks for being awesome guys!!! I recommend them to anybody!!!

Customer service is always great. They are very detailed and you get what you pay for.(want your car detailed, pay for a detail. Car wash is car wash).. I keep my cars detailed and in perfect shape, so it is easy to clean them. I never mind the wait because it beats me doing it myself in 90 degrees. They make the experience enjoyable. The employees know you by name and know how you like your vehicle done. Don't listen to bad reviews, because they are just BS!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I am sorry that I can't give them lower than a 1 star review.  They promised me service would take 45 minutes with an 8:00 appointment.  I was 15 minutes early.  They were 15 minutes late.  They kept promising it would be ready, but it took them 4.5 hours to change a single tire.  The price wasn't the lowest in town.  They also agreed to rotate my tires, but they only rotated two of them.  The only response from corporate was to offer me coupons to force me back to their awful service.  Do not go here.  Go anywhere else.  The platform is disrespect for the customer and gimmicks across the board."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Sorry I can not recommend Safelite. They injected a chip that we had on the windshield for almost ten years. Over the next 10 months it began spreading the chip into a much larger crack. I was told that this work would be applied to a new replacement if it didn't work out or failed. It did, but interestingly enough, they charge $109 more for their work and windshields. Over four hundred dollars for a new one. The other two bids were under at $265 and $296. With my so called credit it cost $303 at Safelite. If an offer is too go to be true it probably isn't. I'm out $108 bucks, live and learn."

They spent a lot of time with us helping to problem solve how we could get our car fixed even though they couldn't completely fix it and weren't going to make $$.  Unheard of, right ?  It is for us, not coming from a small town.  They fixed our AC problem enough so that we could get to the Ozarks with air and then helped us find another auto shop that could do the work.  They even welcomed our new puppy inside in the rain:)

Columbia is lucky to have such kind people.  Thanks for helping my family !"
Automotive,4.5,OR,I had my car towed to Weaver's on July 18th from Tire Kingdom down the street. Bill Weaver checked my car out and reviewed the estimate from Tire Kingdom. He called me and told me I DID NOT need all the work done that Tire Kingdom said I needed. He put a new ignition coil on my car and it was running like a top after that. I am VERY happy my friend Annie talked me into getting a second opinion from Weaver's. THIS is THE place to go for HONESTY and GOOD WORK! I HIGHLY recommend Weaver's for ANY car repair and tires you need!!! I will NOT go ANYwhere else now. I finaly found an HONEST place with HONEST people!
Automotive,1.5,OR,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! The man who owns the company is absolutely rude, disrespectful, unhelpful and just short of vulgar. I called to ask some simple questions like, "" Where are you located and what time does your office Open? "" He was mean and cruel. I was shocked and could not believe he was talking to me or mistreating me this way. I even ask him to take a moment to be nice to me. HE REFUSED!  He actually refuse to be nice or reasonable. How is this company still in business and how is this company on the ADA county sheriff department preferred list???  I would recommend someone, anyone but Pink Towing in Boise."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"My family and I recently moved to the area and found Marco through Yelp. His rave reviews motivated us to move forward with Marco when we had an issue with my wife's vehicle. Since then, Marco is our go-to mechanic. As a mechanic, he is honest and will go the extra mile to help you out. If you have kids with you at the garage, he might dust off some toy cars so that they can play with some toys while you are getting your vehicle fixed! I'm honestly concerned posting this since I don't want the secret out about an amazing mechanic but Marco is totally worth it. If you have a vehicular need, I highly recommend reaching out to Marco!"

Automotive,2.0,OR,I went 3 weeks ago and my car was damaged! The attendant had to enter the car wash and remove my rear wiper that was completely ripped off (control arm and all). I was given an email to notify them of the damage and no one ever responded. I gave them ample enough time to respond now I have to contact my insurance company to file a claim against them . It also pushed my rearview mirror back all the way. I would not recommend this company EVER. The vacuum barely work and you can tell that the workers aren't happy at all. This issue could have been easily resolved but the refuse to contact me for the damages there defective equipment caused.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Service Dept: I had to pay $100 for a diagnostic test that the person on the phone told me needed to be done at the dealership rather than doing it for free at an auto parts store. So I paid the $100 and they told me what was wrong with it. The estimate price is over $700 for a repair that should be no more than $375. I priced the parts and the high end parts cost $233. How is it that a part that costs that much will have around $500 in labor?

Don't get me wrong, the dude behind the counter was very respectfully. Hell, toss him a raise. His name is Daniel. As for the parts and pricing? They were ridiculous."

I never saw them before but they just don't seem to handle things and don't seem to be as friendly as Dennis was and Mike but I I believe Mike moved I wish they would bring Dennis back.

I have called around trying to find a deal on any work we need and I have found the best deal and the best service is always at United Tire of Willow Grove!

Not only that, they were well informed and wanted to help me be well informed too. They gave me lots of information about what went wrong, what I needed and even went to the extent of showing me precisely on my tire what the issue was. When I learned that my tires were beyond repair and I needed new ones, they provided two new tires at an affordable cost and I was able to drive away with two new tires (happily, not four!), pumped old tires and new knowledge. I highly recommend Main Street Tires & Service."

Automotive,2.0,CG,Terrible experience.  The service department has been rude and unprofessional.  When I got my vehicle back I had to ask them to look at it and the manager told me it was fine.  They had no clue what the issue was and it was going to cost me $100 for the diagnostic.  I ended up going to a different place to have it looked at and they said it was just a misdiagnosis and they would need to fix it.

The brakes were fine when I bought the car, but it was going to cost me $800 for the work. I ended up going to another place and got the same issue. I will never go back there again. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else. This is a great place to get your car washed. The staff is friendly and helpful. I got a great deal and a great wash."

They are the only shop I trust and will go"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Have decided to not use this place anymore. I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation. The guy behind the counter said the tires were fine, and it was ready to go in about 15 minutes. The manager told me I had to wait 30 minutes for an oil change. I waited 30 minutes for the car to be taken out of the bay. I went to the car and was told that they didn't have a tech in the bay to do the work. I went back inside, and the manager had no idea what I was talking about."
Automotive,2.5,CG,Nice people when they want to do the job. I will be going back for sure!Great service and great prices! I will definitely be back!I bought a used car from this dealership and had it serviced at a different dealership. I had a problem with the car that I had a warranty with. I called and spoke to the service manager and he was so nice and made me feel comfortable. He even took the time to go over everything with me and explain everything to me. He is also very knowledgeable and helpful. I felt comfortable with my purchase and will definitely return to this dealership.

I just wanted to get an oil change and a tune up and the manager, John, was super nice and honest. He took a look at my car and gave me a tour of the facility. He was very thorough and did not try to sell me on anything I didn't need. I was in and out in about an hour and they even let me drive off in my car. I highly recommend Lloyd's Transmission. I recently moved to Philadelphia from California and had a great experience here."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"My go to oil change and car wash spot in South TAMPA.

They have fast friendly service at reasonable prices.  I got my car fully detailed today for $69.  They went above and beyond for a great price. 

I need synthetic oil, I trust Prestige with my specially car's needs.

 Update!!!
Ask for car detailing services when you arrive. I had my car waxed today and it removed minor blemishes that would not have been covered in a regular service. You have to communicate what you want and they are more than happy to help.  A car wash is not a one size fits all so make sure to communicate exactly what you are .looking for. These guys will take care of you"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I called about replacing the aux port in my 2012 Honda Fit so I could continue using my bluetooth adapter. They didn't have the port on hand but he (I can't recall his name, but super knowledgeable and nice guy) told me the easiest way to acquire the part and said they could install it the same day. I called back due to the high cost of the part and he gave me a few options to consider until I landed on the best solution - which was an aftermarket Bluetooth kit installation. I was able to get the system installed the same day. The process was smooth and well-priced. Bluetooth works great and was a better fix than I was even looking for!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"East Falls Automotive was recommended to me by a friend.  I went there for the first time this week because I needed my yearly inspections/emissions test, an oil change, and new wiper blades. I had called ahead to make an appointment, thought I don't know if that was necessary.

All in all I was very happy with their service. I dropped my car off, walked home, got a call a couple of hours later, and walked back to pick it up.  They didn't try to add on any additional expenses for my oil change or my yearly inspection, which I appreciated. They were friendly and efficient, and you just can't beat having a mechanic that you can walk to. 

Will definitely use again."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Normally they have done a good job vacuuming my car however I usually need to ask them to vacuum between the front seats where it's open around my center console and its never been an issue. This time when I asked him to vacuum that part, because it is open in the middle of my car, the guy who vacuumed just said ""no you're done."" I was caught off guard by this statement and told him I was standing right there and watched him not vacuum that part. He said again that I was done. In my opinion that is very poor customer service and makes me not want to use them again because I am not satisfied with the service I paid for."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I came here on a whim one day and was so thoroughly surprised with the quality of work that I have driven from the West Shore of Lake Tahoe to Mr. Magic just to get my car cleaned there. My CRV was filthy one week; the coldest week so far of the whole year (in the teens), and I felt bad for asking them to give it a detail, but they had no problem accommodating me. Not only that, but they offered to get my taillight fixed at wholesale price rather than go to a dealer (with Honda's part though). Every employee at Mr. Magic is super fantastic....thoughtful, enthusiastic and honest. I recommend this place over any other car detailer in all of California!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"In August, I took my car in for a state inspection.  They said it would be no problem to get a ride from their shuttle.  After an hour, I asked again and he still wasn't back.  He never came back but no one ever checked or said a word to me until the car was done.

On top of the that, the state inspection was $87+ for an almost new car which is about twice as much as I have ever paid.

They asked for me feedback and I told them my issue and I got a computer generated email asking for my feedback again!!

If you want a dealership that charges too much and doesn't care about the customer experience, go to Faulkner."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"LazyDays in Tucson is more than just an RV park. They are a great RV Service and Repair Center, too.  After being in a collision with my RV, I contacted a top-rated collision shop for automobiles in Tucson.  They recommended LazyDays to do my RV repairs.  I called LazyDays and was put in contact with Dale Frei, the manager.  Dale was very helpful and kept me informed every step of the way via phone and email.  Whenever I had a question, Dale was quick to get back to me with an answer.  I was pleased with the service I received from Dale and the LazyDays team, and I highly recommend them to anyone needing RV service or repairs."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Literal waste of money. I had to show my receipt to get a ""rewash"" and even mentioned that the tire covers were still extremely dirty after paying extra for whatever tire upgrade they had. They took brushes to the side of the car and didn't even touch the tires... The photo posted is after TWO washes. I took a paper towel and just wiped the surface of one tire cover and this is what came off.

I used three different vacuums and all of them were cracked so there's barely enough suction to remove dirt let alone pet hair. You're better off using a gas station car wash and a battery powered hand vac from goodwill. It'll do a better job and cost you less!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Don't waste your time here!  We were REFUSED an oil change due to the fact that our last oil change in their system was over/past time and mileage preferred. This was after we told them we have had an oil change somewhere else since. They told us we had a severe oil leak and gaskets were bad.  We have no evidence of oil leak in driveway and Jiffy Lube completed oil change less than hour later and told us gaskets were fine. ALSO, we were not the only ones refused service. Another gentleman left very angry because he was refused an oil change for his truck at the same time.  Wanted to let everyone know that they don't need customers here."

Automotive,3.5,CG,It is unbelievable how this dealership has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have purchased two cars from them and have never had a problem with the service department. The sales manager is a complete jerk and the finance department is horrible.

I had to call them several times to check in on my trade in and they still refused to give me any information on the car I bought.

Only draw back is sometimes, just sometimes you don't get a good of a job done on the side of the car.  I think some of it has to do with how busy it is.  But yesterday I had my carpets and rugs shampooed ($39.99) which includes the $21 wash.

Really surprised at all these reviews they have that are good .....so like I said they did a great job for me the first time. The guy told me they don't do the exterior plastic I'm thinking to myself well what the hell is the $250 for sounds like a line of crap.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"We purchased our first travel trailer from them.  The staff is knowledgeable and cordial.  They provided a complete explanation on how all of the components worked.  On day two of our first adventure, a terrible groaning noise was coming the area of the trailer hitch, sounding like the pain of the dead.  A phone call to Nelson RV identified the problem and solution in a few minutes.  We made an adjustment and off we went, silently.  They are a well run, experienced business that have been a long standing Tucson dealer for 14 years.  When we make our next trailer purchase, we'll call them.  The owner and manger James, is a good man to do business with."

He diagnosed it as such and also informed me that my transmission speed sensor was faulty. Good information. Much appreciated.

I dunno if he doesn't like college-aged kids or what, but this guy was not amiable in the least. I got vague, one-word answers to my questions (I learned not to ask too many after a while). All in all, he didn't seem too happy to have my business, so I don't think I'll be coming back.

Thanks for the info Dave. Not all of us kids are spoiled brats. I just wanted to know what was wrong with my car so that I could fix it."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I planned on being young and fun and cool and wild forever. But then my husband and I got each other new tires for Christmas gifts using a Black Friday deal...soooo I'm pretty sure this is the sign of grownup-hood. It has come. 

I am super pleased with this experience. We got an appointment within 24 hours of making the call. And when it came time to drop the car off they were super flexible with us. The 4 tires were replaced within 2 hours! It's a huge chunk of change, sure. But I feel good about the deal they offered so I would totally recommend waiting for their specials. 

So far so good, the car is riding nice and smooth. Merry Christmas to us!"

I don't have the time to waste while others try to figure out my car's issues.

There's always little things left on it that I need to take off when I get home and they never lift my trunk and dry in the crevices. Lots of workers out there doing the job however, they spend too much time chitchatting with each other instead of paying attention to what they are doing to your car. The prices aren't horrible, and it's in a convenient location. If they could just work and pay attention instead of chatting I would be much happier and would be thrilled to come in and change my rating."
Automotive,4.5,OR,I had a terrible experience here. I paid over $1500 for their work and most of it had to be redone. They replaced my catalytic converter just a couple months ago and I just had to take it in again for another new one. This shouldn't happen! I told them I needed a full diagnosis and to fix anything they saw wrong. I ended up bringing the car back to them 5-6 times to fix problems from their own work and I ultimately just took it to another mechanic and paid double for the work that these guys did and the next mechanic found more that Nashville Auto missed. They seemed very careless and were unhelpful when I asked for them to look things over again.

Tina was able to help us map out other places we could go before/after the Bahamas. She was friendly and personable. We finally back today to book the trip and she made it easy and quick. I like that they use email because I just sent her an email earlier in the day to let her know we were coming and responded  back fairly quickly. We also asked her for suggestions to Chicago even though we booked that online and she was more then happy to help us. I definitely will be booking future vacations with Tina! She's awesome!!!

I called the shop and spoke with two employees. The first guy said they could have a couple of cars in front of me and had it done in 30 minutes. The second guy said he could do it in 30 minutes.

The second guy said it would be about $100-$50 for the same job. I was shocked. I went to the shop and they told me it would be $200. They had to order parts for the next car.

The second guy said that the guy was a mechanic and it would be $100."

You can find slightly cheaper auto repair shops in town if you look hard enough, but they won't be as knowledgeable and honest as Jeremy.  He is always up front and honest about the service my cars needed.  A good mechanic that is honest and does the job right the first time is very valuable.  I know a lot about cars and can tell very quickly if a shop is trying to rip me off.  I will keep taking my car to Oro valley automotive as long as I live in Tucson. I'm glad I found them."

They took excellent care of my vehicle plugged the hole and checked the safety of the tire and sent me on my way for $27

Hey, I have sold cars myself, so I knew pretty much what to expect. Just do your research and be prepared. If it doesn't sound right it isn't.  Got what I felt was a great price on my new car, got a decent trade in value for my old car and decent financing for my credit although they did not mention that Toyota was releasing 0% financing for qualified buyers at all while it was actually running when I purchased, but that was my own stupidity. OK, so in summary, Do research, go prepared, your the boss but don't have a god complex, be reasonable!"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Delta Auto Protect is a scam company. I purchased a warranty from them and have attempted a claim with them. They approved repair but then never paid the repair shop for the work they approved leaving me to pay the shop myself. Their phone system is ridiculous as they rarely answer. If they do answer you get the runaround or they will flat out lie to you. Often an answering service will take the call but won't be able to answer questions or will transfer you to a voicemail. They will tell you about how the payment is held up in finance or a check is being cut, or the check was sent, then you should have received it, etc. A SCAM COMPANY."

Automotive,3.0,CG,"RUN!  
This place is a joke and the owner is a piece of crap. I went there to get an oil change and the guy said they're open till 6. They close at 6. They told me it'd be a couple of hours. I was told it would take about an hour. 2 hours later I was told it would take about an hour to complete the oil change. I was shocked. When I went to pay for my car I was told that I had to have it washed and they had no clue about it. I told them I was going to wait for them to finish it and wait."

I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation and had a coupon for a free tire rotation.  I was in and out in less than an hour.

Automotive,5.0,OR,"I mean, when you have to drop hundreds of dollars on your car, no one is happy.  That said, they give you honest feedback and tons of information. You feel you have a choice in what is going on. They seem to do good / quality work - and if I have to get my car fixed again, I'll be going back. I'd say it's hard to find a place you feel 'good' about - giving money too - but I guess if I have to give the cash away, I'll give it to them! 

Super helpful and provide great information as well as references / recommendations if they can't help (as recently they couldn't - as I needed specific convertible top work that they don't do)."
Automotive,4.0,OR,I am beyond impressed with what Justin did. His original time frame was 3 days to repair. He literally did it in a day earlier which made me very happy because it even saved me a day worth of car rental. I got 10 different estimates from other body shops and he was neither too cheap nor too expensive and his prices were somewhere in the middle which met my expectations and it was super thoroughly done with the exact paint matching of my car. Definitely I am grading him as 5/5 and probably higher but unfortunately that is the highest grading score the google reviews has set up. Will definitely use him next time as he is really good with what he has done. Good work justin.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Eh, for a fast car wash, this one is pretty ok.  It definitely misses spots though, especially around trim with difficult angles.  I just bring a soft towel and wipe it up while I'm using the vacuums.  Not a huge deal for an inexpensive and fast wash.  

I like that they have the tiny little air blower to get dust out of the vents and other harder to wipe spots.  It definitely helps clean the inside of the car up.

The employees have always been very nice to us, even the guys who apply soap to the car.  They always wave and smile.

We'll definitely keep bringing our cars here for washes when we don't have a ton of time to have them detailed."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I do appreciate their hiring of what appears to be students and locals.  But after having to pay extra for rain x as a protectant, bug remover and the washing of my cars mats I was taped, fifty plus dollars to be exact.  Here's what I feel is and injustice.  When I asked if they had any discounts to lower the tab a few dollars  I was informed no.  To me that's a major let down and may keep me Away and frequent the car wash on N Dale Mabry near Waters Ave.  s we adjust to this new norm at least a few dollars consideration Is well received and echoed to others.  Mission Bell Car Wash you should do better."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"My mother and I had to put down our dog and JUST wanted our car cleaned after since she sheds so much. We paid for the most expensive wash and detailing of the inside and it was HORRIBLE. I could've done a better job myself. I was so so sad that the ""friendly smiles"" did such a poor job. Seems like the owner hires a bunch of people that know how to smile but none that know how to clean cars. Hope this has changed since we've been. I was very hurt with the service... and when I said something they said it looked fine when I could clearly see dog hair. Oh and they were completely done in under 15 minutes. With an over $60 detailing purchase."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Be very careful if making a reservation for one of Ford's new models. This dealership will convert your reservation into an order without getting your consent, and even go as far as to change the vehicles features thinking you won't find out, and I'm guessing, they believe you will refuse the vehicle when it comes in. Shady dealership trying to use the old bait and switch method. Little do they know that when it's your reservation number, you get an email on everything that takes place. I also have an email dated recently to them that I was not ready to convert. Make sure everything is in writing and documented with them if you decide to use them, but I wouldn't. RUN. Read the other reviews on here..."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I purchased a used car from here was extremely dissatisfied with the customer service. The particular dealer I had the ""pleasure"" of working with was Fred Roberto. He continuously made snippy remarks, was disrespectful and very unprofessional during the process. I was purchasing my first car so I wanted to make sure it was right for me. He made me feel rushed and had a sense of urgency. I went through my bank to do financing, so it took a few days to get approved and get the check.  Fred continuously called me inquiring when I was coming back with the money. I ultimately purchased the vehicle because it was a good fit but not before going through hell with Fred first. Stay away from this dealership!"

Automotive,4.0,CG,What a huge disappointment. I had an appointment with the service dept. for a simple oil change. I had an appointment and I was told that they would be there in a couple of hours. They had no loaner cars so I was told it would be about two hours. I arrived at my appointment time at 9:30am. At 11:15 I was told that the service dept. had not even looked at my vehicle. I was told that I would have to wait for a rental car for a few hours. I waited another two hours. When I got home I found that the service dept.

I was told the issue would be resolved. Well it was a month later and I still had not heard anything. I called and asked if they could fix it.

I've been to BMW of Tucson twice since moving here and both times, having to deal with the only man behind the parts counter, just made my day again. I've owned many BMWs in a span of over 30 years and this place is nothing compared to BMW of Honolulu, Ft. Walton, Montgomery, and dealerships in Germany.  BMW of Honolulu, rated the best in my book have so much Aloha, I wish they could send some your way.   This will not deter me from owning a BMW but it will definitely have a lasting effect on my choice of dealerships when its time to purchase another BMW."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I am generally satisfied with the service I have received here since I purchased my RAV4 2 years ago. 

Staff are generally courteous, professional, and prompt. Comfortable waiting area and easy enough to get work done while they were doing routine mileage maintenance checks or state inspection checks. 

They do charge a high labor rate though and are pricier than even other Toyota area dealerships including Del Toyota in Thorndale where my sister gets her older RAV4 serviced for annual state inspections and auto emissions.

I'll continue to possibly bring my car here for the free state inspection annually as long as I live in the area but for routine maintenance I'll go elsewhere where the parts and labor rates are much more reasonable and I personally know the owners."

I went there dropped my car off left they called and told me I needed a starter I said can you just get the car started I'll drive it to my husband's shop. When my husband looked at the car they had not hooked up the negative are the positive battery cable and the car starts just fine I did not need a starter. I would never take my car here again they were very nice but now I see why they were nice they were trying to get another $500 and some dollars out of me. Please never take your car to them ever ever.

Friend called the day before to confirm that the car was there and the price before we drove over an hour to get there. We checked out the car it was very nice and we were ready to buy when he dropped the real price on us of $34,600 - a HUGE difference! We could get a new car for that price!  The salesman said sorry that must be a typo but was unapologetic or willing to negotiate. Of course he was willing to show us something else.

They supply you with all the documentation, a full tank of gas and your on your way! She was very honest that the vehicle wasn't in the condition she had promised from the previous dealership but did all she could to have a few minor blemishes buffed out before pick up! I would highly recommend this dealership, but would recommend Ronaye over anyone!"

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Service dated 2/12/17

The customer service is terrible and rude, service is not completed. I scheduled an appointment for oil change and tire rotation at 11 am, and Mr. Soroosh said that it won't be done until 5pm meanwhile I have scheduled for waiting and pick up. It took them 6 hours to get oil change and tire rotation? 
I got the call from Soroosh that my car will be done before 4pm, when I came pick up my car. Soroosh said that tire rotation wasn't done because I rushed them. His attitude was extremely rude and unprofessional. Instead of apologizing to customer, he blamed on me for rushing him, that's why the service hasn't done yet. I felt so disappointed not only about bad customer service, but also unwell-done job."

Add insurance without telling me, and said i didnt tell them not to add on my tire change.  leave white lub all over new tire and rim,  uneven pressure displayed on my car after tire change, expensive  oil change without topping off other fluid.

they dont have any knowledge on tires either, i.had a small bump on my tire, and asked how can this happen , they told me, because u have some off brand cheap tires, i was like i have 200,dollar falken tires on, then they went find 3 other reason.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"These guys are GREAT.  The place is basically clean and the staff is friendly and helpful.  I've been twice now, once for an oil change and once for my inspection and both times were quick and easy.  They were a little busy when I went in for the inspection, but they were honest about the waiting time and I REALLY appreciate that.  They told me it would take about 45 minutes and that's exactly how long it took.  I understand places get busy and get backed up, that happens, all that I want is for them to tell me that it is busy and backed up and to expect a wait.  There is nothing more frustrating than having no idea!  5 big stars"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This place was awesome today.  I had pulled into two other tire places looking for air, including Tire Barn a few feet from them, and I could not get any outdoor tire pressure help.  As soon as I pulled into TireDiscounters, Adam, a manager came out ready to help me.  I was so happy, for his quick help, as I was trying to start a three hour trip with low tires.  I tried to give him a 5.00 tip, and he wouldn't take it.  That's when he told me he was the manager.  I told him my whole story- he said to come back any time.  When I need new tires- I'm coming here!  Thank you Adam!

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had an Audi that was no longer needed.  Instead of Craigslist or eBay, I went to Carmax and they gave me a bit more than the price I was expecting. They were very professional and I thought their assessment of the weaknesses of my vehicle were all accurate. They were patient and respectful and they did not waste my time. I don't comment often on Yelp, but I was astonished at the terrific service.  One of the rare times I have left a dealership without a bad taste in my mouth.  Whatever you plan to do with that car you need to get rid of, go to Carmax first and see if their
bid doesn't convince you not to go through the hassle of selling it yourself"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"That rare combination of super fast but also super thorough customer service! This was honestly the most pleasant oil change I have ever experienced. No getting out of your car, as soon as you pull up someone hands you a cold water and asks what you need. Once you pull in they give you oil options, and there is no pressure to buy extra like the other places I have been to. They even show you where the a/c filter in your glovebox is in case you want to change it yourself (I did not). So much better than either A) sitting in a waiting room for an oil change that takes forever or B) going to a place that is fast at the expense of customer service and performance."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I dropped my car off at 9am and was told an hour and a half to diagnose a check engine light. I decided to wait around for about half an hour and then I walked across the street to do some shopping. I returned an hour after originally dropping my car off and noticed it hadn't moved. The guy at the counter informed he had tried to call me, which he had not, and informed me that the diagnostics guy didn't come in that day so they couldn't fix the problem. 

I'll never return here so I don't know if it's an isolated incident but the entire operation seems badly run. I overheard them telling several people upwards of two hours for an oil change. Enter at your own risk."

It's a little pricey for a car but I always feel like they have the best price. I have also found them to be very quick and efficient with the service. They will even give you a discount if you're not happy. They are very friendly and have a very friendly staff. I'd recommend them to anyone who is in need of a car. I had a great experience with AutoNation Nissan.

We received a call at 11:00 to come in for their Labor Day special to trade in our current Kia to a new Kia at no extra cost and keeping our same current payment......Not!!! They were so unprepared, they had none of our information ready when we had originally purchased our Kia from them. Such a huge waste of our day off. It went as far as the highest sales manager trying to persuade us into a new lease agreement with $450 down and a new payment of $150 More than my current payment! Stop calling me Kia with these deals! See you in 2018 when my Lease is up!"

I called Metro to find out if they have footage of the accident, but they do not have cameras in the car wash. Unfortunately now I am left with a damaged car, an out of pocket deductible, and no resolution. Use at your own risk."

He helped us tremendously in helping choose the right vehicle for our family- 2018 Honda Odyssey. While there is a wait on the new Honda Odyssey, Leroy worked very hard and got us the vehicle next day itself by shopping /trading around with other Honda deadlier ships in the city. We traded our Acura vehicle in and received a fair price. The finance part was also very smooth. I got a rate of 1.99% APR. 
All through one noticeable thing was the staff made us comfortable without putting any pressure to buy the vehicle. This is probably the best and smoothest vehicle transaction we have had thus far. Special mention and 5 stars to Leroy Hines."

I stopped by to get a pair of headlamps for my Ford Explorer. The young man behind the counter looked up my vehicle and decided there are two possible models. He then went out to my vehicle and pulled the lamps out to ensure he had the right one. While another employee picked out a rear windshield wiper for me, the first employee installed my new lamps. He even saved the one working lamp for me.

While installing my head lamps, the employee noticed that my lenses are worn.  He told me about a product he used with good results. Since he gave such great service, I took him up on his offer for head lamp restoration kit.  I hadn't tried it yet but my headlamps sure are bright."

Also after emailing them to tell them what happened I got a response ""we are sorry you were experiencing problems with your app here's  $5 credit"" first off a driver not showing up after conformation and reminder has nothing to do with my app it's the driver's incompetence and shove your $5 where the sun doesn't shine!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Worst experience ever! In the past, we have bought all our cars there, new and used. We also use their auto services for oil changes, etc. As we were in need of buying an used vehicle, we went back to Toyota Tampa Bay... big mistake! The sales rep was very rude and pretty much made us feel like idiots for wanting to get an used toyota Corolla, 2014 or newer, with less than 60,000 miles for around $11,000 - $12,000... we left very discouraged.. after a couple of more places with better customer service, we realized we need to reevaluate our search. I'm happy to say we bought a Toyota Corolla 2017 with 39,000 miles for $13,388 at Hertz Car Sale! Our sales rep was Jean Papy, he is the best!!!"

I would not recommend this service department. They are terribly rude and spend their time talking poorly of customers.. they do not acknowledge you as you walk in even if you say hi. The only exception is Kevin. He's very professional. The rest of them are very rude. One of them will just stare at you and not say anything. I am a minority, so maybe that has something to do with it. Then again, maybe they are just rude."

We told them we would be interested in it. They said ""yes"" and we would be given a call when it was ready. When we got there, we were told that the deal was not made. When we asked why it was not made, they told us that they were not going to make it right. The sales manager, Mike, was not willing to honor the deal we had been told and we were told that they were not responsible for"
Automotive,3.5,CG,Christina and her technicians are always friendly and helpful.  I will continue to go to this location.I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Sonata from the Lithia Hyundai of Reno store.  The buying experience was fantastic.  The experience was excellent.  The sales team was knowledgeable and helpful.  I was able to get a good deal on the car I was looking for.  I was able to get the car I wanted and they even let me test drive it for me.  I couldn't be happier with my new car.  They also worked with me to get a great deal on the car.  I would recommend Lithia Hyundai
Automotive,2.5,CG,"My last visit to CarZone was an unpleasant one.  I will not be going back to them.I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Elantra from Autonation Hyundai in November 2016. The buying experience was fantastic. I was very pleased with the service provided by the salesman. I had a very pleasant experience. I did not feel pressured to buy a car at all. I will most likely purchase my next Hyundai from them.Great experience, friendly and quick. I got my car done in a matter of minutes, and I was out the door in about an hour! Great prices too.Just bought a new car from here and it was the"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. I will never ever go back to this place. I had a bad experience with the manager, and he was great. The manager was rude and rude. I will never use them again. I had a very positive experience with a used Honda CR-V. I was very impressed with the level of service I received from Mark. He gave me a fair price and made sure I was getting a good deal. I would definitely recommend this dealership for any Honda needs. I've been here several times, never had a problem and the service is always fast and courteous."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Waste of time!

I found a vehicle online and was very pleased with it. When I got there the salesman (I am the best) was very nice and seemed very honest. The sales manager was very nice and personable. The finance manager was also very nice and seemed to be very knowledgeable about the vehicle. I ended up going with the finance manager, and he was very helpful. He made me feel comfortable with the purchase and financing process. The manager was very patient and very accommodating. Overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a vehicle.I had a great experience with AutoNation Nissan."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Carmax is awesome for purchasing a vehicle. No pressure, no sales person walking around you and harassing you.
However, their service is not that great. So if you still have warranty, go for it. They are awful to give you a rental if they need to keep your car for extended days, even if you have extended warranty to cover. It takes 2 days for them to approve that. In the meanwhile, you don't have a car.
Their shuttle service is awful, they only take you 5 miles range and one way ride only.
Some of their service people don't seem to have good knowledge of services, they don't follow up when they say they will call you at a certain time.
They are not open on the weekends, so it's even harder for working people."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"DO NOT COME TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. Absolutely horrible. My insurance company sent them out to my car broken down in my driveway, was told they'd be there at 3:45, the latest. Shows up at 5:20, told the guy the car will not start. He took 15 minutes trying to jump it, comes back up to the door after putting the jumper cables away. Let's me know that he has to go to a ""police call"", and someone would be back in 20 minutes. I find out he broke my key fob, and probably left because of that. 20 minutes pass, no other tow truck. But, he told his ""manager"" he left because there was a car obstructing his access to mine. Lies. Absolutely horrible company, made sure my insurance knew about it."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This Auto Spa location offers an excellent array of car wash and detailing services, including very affordable monthly plans.  The staff are all extremely courteous and friendly and focused on delivering a great product.  Their thoroughness and attention to detail-both inside and out-is second to none.  If you ever see something that needs to be addressed, of there is something that you'd like done, simply ask and you'll be taken care of.  Since the goal is a great service, the staff don't try to ""push"" as many cars through as possible so they take a few minutes longer than other washes at the end to make sure you get their ""A+"" job every time.  Sit back and enjoy it-and drive away with your car looking its best!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,Be vigilant with these coyotes ....Bought a used Tacoma here. Truck did not have running/marker lights that worked (took me five minutes to replace bulbs! Really?). Drivers headlight  did not work (replaced a bulb - really service folks? Really?) Vehicle had a surging idle (1200 to 2000 RPMs at idle) issue (the salesman said that the dealership service folks/manager said his was normal - pure BS). I too fixed this upon arrival. I was told the truck would be detailed and it was not. Alternator bolt fell out of the alternator in transit - found it (on transport  deck) and  reinstalled. Long story short: don't believe what they say - make sure they do what they say. Smack of what/why people hate  car sales people and slimy dealerships.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Highly recommend The Parking Spot 2!! From the drivers, to the check out process, and everything in between, the parking spot is a great experience. 

They have vans picking up from the airport very frequently, so you're never waiting long to be picked up from the airport. 

I just parked my car there this week. Unfortunately I left 4 cans of seltzer in the car and who knew how cold it was going to be (-5 degrees!!). Needless to say, all 4 cans exploded and actually turned into ice all over my car. I had valeted my car and when I arrived there were three employees cleaning out my car from all the ice. Talk about excellent customer service!! 

I have always used The Parking Spot and highly recommend it to others!!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Buyer Beware! My husband and I had a horrible experience negotiating and losing a deal to purchase a 2011 Highlander.  The sale person had incorrect facts about the car, including the price and the Toyota Certification.  When a deal was finally reached, we drove to the dealership, and they made us wait for 45 minutes.  We continually asked what the delay was.  Finally we realized they were signing a contract with another couple for the same car.  They used us as bait to get another offer on the car.  They are highly unprofessional and wasted our time.  The sales staff had a very nonchalant attitude towards the situation and offered no apology for the situation.  I wouldn't trust this dealership with any car purchase."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"They do a good job w exterior but I would rate the interior detail just okay for the price charged.  Also I don't know if it was because it was quttin' time but service was less than positive.  When asked what I wanted, I requested the Premium and then was told no you can't have that because we close in 15 minutes.  Hmmm....  So ordered the Works and got the fastest service ever - again probably because I was the last car.  The speed made me a bit nervous and it showed in the detailing. Still sand inside my car but at least the lovebugs are gone from the exterior.  I might come back in a jam but otherwise think I'll stick w Sunshine on Court."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"This is now my second time dealing with this dealership. I will not be buying a car from here. If you want to get your car serviced, you're in a bind. We bought a used car from here. We were told it was going to be a two hour wait. We picked it up at the dealership and it was not ready. They told us they had already made a mistake and had to order a part from the dealer. I have a warranty on the car and it is now 3 weeks later and they have not called us back. 

We have a second vehicle we have purchased from this dealership and they have been very rude."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Fantastic experience from first phone call to the final paperwork. I will definitely recommend them to anyone looking to buy a new car!I am a very loyal customer of this place. I took my car here for an oil change and a tire rotation. I had a nail in my tire and they were able to repair it within the hour. I had to wait on my car so I could get home. They had me in and out in an hour and I didn't even have to wait. They were friendly, helpful and the price was very fair. They also honored a coupon I had on their website. I would definitely go back here again."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Whatever you do, don't make it an easy task to do.

If you have a vehicle, do your research and find the most reasonable and reliable repair shop in the area.I have been going to this location for years and have always had excellent service.  I have had several different vehicles serviced here over the years and have always had great experiences.  I've had great experiences with the staff, and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an oil change or a state inspection.I recently purchased a new 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee from this dealership.  I was able to trade it in, and get a good price on the vehicle. "
Automotive,4.0,CG,Mike Shutts was a great guy.  He took me in right away and did a thorough job.  He was very thorough and explained everything to me.  He took great care of me.  I would highly recommend this business.I had an appointment with Mike to replace a window regulator and a headlight bulb. I was told by Mike that the job would take 3 hours. I arrived at 4:00 and they were closed for the day. I was told that the service would take 30 minutes. I left the car at 4:30 and was called at 4:00 to pick it up. They were closed. They didn't have the equipment
Automotive,5.0,CG,"RNR installed snow tires on my Tacoma and the price was very reasonable. The work was done quickly and efficiently. The price was reasonable, and the workmanship was great. The only downside is that they had to order a part which would take about an hour and a half. The staff was friendly and professional. They also did an excellent job installing my new tires. I will definitely be returning for my next set of tires.This place is great. I have a 2012 Mazda 3 that I purchased from them. I'm not sure if I've ever been lied to or cheated by them. They are always honest and upfront about what they can do to make you"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I stopped in last week, and they had the best prices I could find for my car. They were so friendly and accommodating. I also have a 2013 Volvo S60 and it was worth the extra money. I'm a loyal customer for life and will be back. I love my car and will continue to go back to them. I had to wait 3 months for a part to come in to install a part that was on my order. It's been almost 3 weeks and I still haven't received the part. I called the store and was told the parts had come in and it would be ready in a week or two."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Of course, they are at it again.  On April 23rd I received yet another letter, this one from  Patrick Betancourt, General Blood Sucker (""General Sales Manager"" in Toyotaspeak) attempting to manipulate me into selling my less than two year old vehicle back to the dealership.  They will never stop.  And because they won't, I changed my rating from two stars to one.  Giving them one star is one star more than they deserve.  

By the way, Kindra, you truly seem like a nice person.  Do you know that you can get a job with decent and honest people?  Why do you work for these #%$@+& types?  Is the money really all that much better?  What about your self-respect?  What about common decency?"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Why does the oil change on my 1997 Cadillac always costs more than $100.00.  At 3000 miles my wife always takes our car for an oil change. 3000 miles ???. In my younger days we always just added oil if needed. most of the time it wasn't needed. if this trend continues, you will be using more oil than gasoline. and $100.00 per oil change ??? Not only that. I took my 1999 chevy in for an oil change and a week later my warning light goes on.""Change oil soon.""

Wanna talk about livid? I trace the manager down to here a lame excuse that was short-handed even after I asked twice about not wasting my day. No big deal to them.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"I always know I can count on Paul's team of professionals to maintain my cars in top shape.  This time it was our 2003 Mini Cooper S that suddenly had a dead battery, which I diagnosed and remedied with a bit of electrolyte, but I wanted them to double check it anyway.  While I was at it, I had them change the oil & filter.  Following their systems check and load draw test regimen, fortunately nothing was found and both Steve and Bruce reassured me that all systems were working as expected - even the battery was healthy, but I should keep an eye on the water levels.  The work was done on time and at the quoted price, providing me spot on service!  Thanks Paul and team!"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Ordered a new compressor from them on eBay. The listing claimed it was a brand new OEM Zexel unit. This thing came in a cheap chinese box and the compressor itself had no marking or sticker that indicated it was a  Zexel or Nissan part. Had it installed at the mechanics anyways, and he informed me that the part was a cheap chinese knockoff. When it came time to charge the ac system, the compressor was turned on and it did NOTHING. This isn't a compressor, it's an empty metal case. Do not buy anything from these guys they're dishonest and their customer support lies through their teeth. I payed a premium of 300 for an OEM part and instead got a part i could've payed 80 bucks for from other sellers."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I took my mercedes down for a dead battery and windows that wouldn't roll down. I told them to change the battery, and maybe look at the fuses because the dash lights weren't working properly. Seems simple enough.

They called two days later ( on this battery issue) and said they needed to keep it over the weekend to check the amps. He couldnt figure out what he called ""was drawing"" amps. I let him keep it over.

5 days later he finally called me, at 3 in the afternoon. they said it was working fine and come and get it. They lied. All they did was replace the battery, and it took them 5 days! They did not replace any fuses, they did not fix the windows. The charge $400.00
I do not recommend them."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"CAUTION*** DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! 

I will never ever go back to them. I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Sonata from the Lithia Hyundai of Reno store. The buying experience was fantastic. The experience was excellent.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a car. I will be recommending to all of my friends and family. I will definitely be back. Thank you Lithia Hyundai of Reno!A good experience at this location."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"The service was subpar. After a few weeks the oil light came on. When I got home the check engine light was on again. The car was still running fine, so I took it back to the dealership and they fixed it free of charge. I would recommend this place to anyone!I had a great experience with this dealership. I went in to look at a few cars and was told by my salesman that they were able to meet me on a Saturday and that I would have to drive it to the dealership for service. I arrived at the dealership and was greeted by the sales manager, Mike. He was very patient with me and was able to get me"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"I loved that Geist offered a discount and let me know if it was my fault for not following up. I had to get a call from the manager and he said he would get back to me within an hour. I called the next morning and he said he would get back to me within an hour. I picked up my car and the mechanic who showed me the issue told me to bring it back in. I asked him if they could fix it since I'm from the area and he said no, they're too busy to get it fixed. I was very upset with the service and thought I'd give him a try."
Automotive,4.5,CG,(Writing this review from Las Vegas) and the owner of this location. The person who helped me was not very friendly. I was told by the manager that the owner was going to go over it and call me back in a few hours. I called back two hours later and the manager was very rude to me and told me that the owner was on vacation and that I could bring it back in. I explained that I was on vacation and I needed a tow and he said that it would take about an hour and a half. I said that I was going to be here a few hours later and he said that it would take about an hour.
Automotive,4.0,CG,"I recently (two months ago) had an issue with my vehicle.  I called my mechanic and he told me that the problem was the transmission.  The mechanic was honest and told me that he had no idea what the problem was and that they had to order parts for it.  He also recommended a new transmission because it was under warranty.  I made an appointment for the following week.  When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, they told me that the transmission was not covered under warranty.  I asked why the transmission was covered under the warranty and was told that it was a lie.  I am still waiting for my vehicle to be fixed."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I've taken my car here over 3 times - and one of those times was because the body shop I took it to (a local small-chain) did not do a good job, and every time I took it back to said place, they never fixed it.

Anyway, Johnny is a great guy and a straight-shooter. I always felt like his prices were fair, that he and his guys work quickly, and his estimates are accurate. If you're looking for a slick, fancy, shiny waiting area and fancy office, this is not the place for you. I'd much rather sit in a tiny office and have my car fixed right and for a fair price than pay for Keurig coffee and over-priced waiting-area furniture.

I always recommend Black Horse whenever anyone has anything- especially body work- done."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I'm so happy I found Jo Jo's. I have a 2020 4Runner that's 5months old with 15,000 miles on her. She needed a good wash and wax so I stopped by and made an appointment. Michele and Jo are two of the nicest people you'll ever meet. They looked over my truck and gave me a price for a wash, clay bar, polish, wax and interior cleaning and I made an appointment. Dropped it off in the morning and picked it up early afternoon and I couldn't be happier. She looks like the day I bought her. The outside shines and is smooth as glass to the touch. I'll be back once a month for a hand wash and I'll give her the full treatment every 6 mos. Thanks for all your hard work!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"J&J Motors is the auto shop that everyone wishes they could find: they are honest, knowledgeable, very easy to work with, and they do a great job on cars. I first went to them when I moved to Bryn Mawr with a VW Jetta on its last legs, and they were up-front about what was worth fixing and what was not. They seem to work on cars from all parts of the spectrum, from very high-end luxury cars to the grad student's car that just needs to make it through the year (mine). When my car finally died, they went out of their way to help me donate it for the (minimal) tax break. I recommend them to my friends in Philadelphia even though they are 30 min away -- they are that good."

Unfortunately, the page held a banner saying they no longer handled reservations for ProWax Detailing!
Next step - email Chris (as per the original automated email).  2 1/2 weeks later and no response.
Next step - complain to LivingSocial, who gave me a phone number for Chris (one that is conspicuously not shown on their web site!).  Called and left a message over a week ago.  No response.  Now, calls to the number are met with a system message that his mailbox is full.  Clearly he is not listening to his messages either.
Looks very much like a fraudulent company to me!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I have used this company in the past never had a problem with old owner,but I must say this is worst customer service I have ever seen,I have been waiting on my vehicle for over three weeks they change (2) hydraulics on a soft top and now the top won't go down and they can't figure this out and now they won't take my calls and they have been paid in full now I may have to get my attorney involve because Chuck  whose the owner would have you speak to his mechanic Adolfo but when you pay your invoice he takes care of that very well.Do yourself a favor get an appointment with Benson and spend the extra money to get perfect customer service and get the job right the first time."
Automotive,1.5,CG,Worst Company ever! I financed a vehicle and the paperwork was not sent back to me. I got a new vehicle and had to get a new car. The paperwork was not sent back to me. They had no record of the title. The contract was not sent to me. The manager said they would email me with a date and number. I got the phone call a day later from the manager. He stated he would email me with an update. I never received a call back. I called to talk to the manager and he stated he would call me back. I never got a call back from him. They promised to send me a check but never received.
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Ok, where to begin. I had an appointment with the service dept. for a simple oil change. I had an appointment and I was told that they would be there in a couple of hours. They had no loaner cars so I was told it would be about two hours. I arrived at my appointment time at 9:30am. At 11:15 I was told that the service dept. had not even looked at my vehicle.

Automotive,4.0,CG,I was recommended by my neighbor who had an oil change done at another shop. I was told by a friend that the oil change was done and that the car was in great shape. The oil was only $3.00 which was extremely reasonable. I was also told that they would also install a new radiator because it was leaking and that the car was having issues with the car. They did not charge me anything and I was happy to go. I will definitely be returning for my next oil change!I've been going to this Pep Boys for years and it's never bad.  They are always honest and reliable.  They never try to oversell or oversell

The first time we visited this dealership, we had a great experience with the sales department. The sales manager was very nice and friendly. He listened to our needs and wants. He gave us the best deal possible and gave us a great deal.

The second time we visited, the sales manager was very nice and professional. He was able to go over everything and let us test drive a new car. 

The second time, we had a really great experience with the sales manager, Mr. Lillia. She was very professional and was very helpful in answering all of our"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Worst vehicle buying experience ever.  The dealership is a joke.  Sales person was rude and we had a bad conversation about the vehicle.  The sales manager was nice and very helpful.  They had no clue what the vehicle was for.  I was told it was in stock and they would call me when it was ready.  

They never called me.  They didn't have the vehicle I wanted.  They just called me back a week later and said they had to order it for me.  They would not honor the price.  They just wanted to make a sale and try to sell me a vehicle that didn't exist. "
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Nothing but great things to say about the dealership and the service department. The sales team is knowledgeable and friendly. The sales managers are also knowledgeable and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone in the market for a new or used car. I will be back for sure. I was looking to purchase a new vehicle and I had to work with several people to get the deal done. This was not the case with the Sales Manager, Keith. I had been in contact with him about my purchase and he assured me he would get back to me within 48 hours of my arrival. I ended up getting a call from him from Keith."
Automotive,2.0,CG,We went in to purchase a new car and we were greeted by a Salesperson. He was very knowledgeable and we had a great time talking to him. He was very patient and made sure we understood everything about the vehicle. We were very happy with the price and the features. The entire experience was very smooth and quick. I will definitely be back and recommend to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle. Thank you!!This place is great. I came in to get a tire patched and they were able to get me in right away. I'm not sure why I got here so fast but it's a little more expensive than some other places in town.
Automotive,3.5,OR,"If I could I would give them zero stars. Had my rear brakes done and need to clear the ABS light. Just so happened both rear speed sensors broke during the install.(mentioned nothing) Victory even had the balls to tell me that they would  run a diagnostics for $100 to see what was wrong when I picked up my car. The ABS light was still on. You can't trust them! It seems like a nice place, clean space good people and up front pricing. Maybe it was the mechanic trying to hide the fact, maybe it was an honest mistake. But I've never felt so cheated buy a mechanic before. Just know that if you do take something there you're rolling the dice and could be in for a huge expense down the road."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"A gas station worthy of reviewing, you ask?!?  Well, not only was this particular station perfectly located for anyone en route to Mt. Rose Ski Resort from Reno (located at the corner of Mt. Rose Hwy. and Thomas Creek Road), they're also well-equipped (snowboard rentals, clean interior, one bank of video poker machines, and snow chains). But the absolute review-worthy highlight - the quirkiest bronze sculpture just outside the front doors to the convenience store - a bench with Mark Twain reading a book!  This item was a serious landmark for me (It's actually quite an impressive sculpture and I'm determined to discover the motivation behind it at this particular location). see the photo. And btw. three stars for being conveniently located relative to our empty gas light situation driving to/from Mt."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Today I went in for an oil and battery check, and the experience was very relaxing. Yes, relaxing. They have wifi, free coffee, and a comfy seating area. I graded papers peacefully while waiting. 

I knew that something was up with my shocks, and my tires really needed to be replaced. The mechanic let me know that my brake fluid needed to be changed along with the tires, and my shock fluid is leaking. This was a confirmation of a few things I already suspected. I do a lot of long distance driving and maintenance is becoming a must. 

The prices were reasonable, and the technician didn't pressure me to fix anything on the spot. I decided to go ahead and get half the work done, but I will be back for the rest soon."
Automotive,4.5,OR,I had a scratch on one of my back doors and went through Insurance. When I took my car in to get quoted you can tell that they really care about their work and Victor said that he would recommend they do the passenger door as well otherwise the doors would look like they were two different colors. Insurance pushed back by Happy's fought for the customer and we ended up get everything fixed just the way I wanted and all I had to pay was the deductible.  They had to keep my car longer than promised because an appraiser had to come out and okay the extra work so they went ahead and detailed my car for me when it was done. My car has never looked so good!  Thanks so much.
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I am not the eloquent writer and this was not the Ritz, but Miracle Rv Park was good.  The people - many are long terms - are friendly, helpful, quiet, and polite.  The park itself is old but upkept.  The wifi works, the laundry facility was clean, and the clubhouse was small but clean.  There were ample spaces to choose from and long and wide enough to back-in my 30' bumper pull.  Water pressure was superb and no problems with electric or sewer.  The drive lanes are narrow - so those who aren't proficient backers may want to pass on this one.  We stayed 2 nights for $35 each while visiting my daughter who lives nearby.  We had no problems with our two GSDs there as well."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I assisted my Mom in the purchase of a Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit that was mainly handled via phone calls and text messages as we are located over 3 hours from the dealership.  

Our sales expert Bill (aka Tank) could not have been more professional.  He provided a great price and the way the entire process was handled was first class all the way.

Tank is a true gentleman and went out of his way to explain every single feature upon delivery.  When we originally scheduled the delivery there was a mixup with our communication however this was handled in a way that completely exceeded our expectations.  

I cannot stress enough how professional Tank, Felix and all at Jim Browne are.  You will not go wrong by giving them your business."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I think the last time I was at Lube City was about 5 years ago when I first moved here.  Everytime I felt like they were pushing me into all these extra costs so I decided to never go back.  I have been going to Mr. Lube where I can get my oil changed for about $60.  Today I was in Sherwood park close to Lube City and I decided I would go again out of convienece and just turn down any extras they tried to sell.  My oil change was $115!!! That is crazy! They said that the only oil they carry for my car is their premium oil.  I would believe that if I drove a porshe maybe, but I have a Mitsubishi Lancer. Its a standard vehicle."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"I spent a couple busy days with the dealership and decided to purchase a new car. I'm very pleased with the new car I got. 

I worked with a sales manager that I was comfortable with and was very patient with me. He was very friendly and knowledgeable. He knew what I wanted and was able to work with me on the price. I felt like I got a good deal and had a good experience. I'm very happy with my new car and will be coming back to this dealership for service.I have been going to this Jiffy Lube since I moved to Nashville and have always had great service at a good price. I have to say"

I was told it would take about an hour to complete the job. I was told it would take about an hour and an hour. I came back two hours later to find out that the car had been finished. The technician said they did not inspect the car and it was a waste of time. I would have liked to have been notified of the completion"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I can't speak to their customer service, but the folks here are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.I recently purchased a preowned Hyundai Sonata from the Lithia Hyundai of Reno store.  The buying experience was fantastic.  The experience was excellent.  The sales team was knowledgeable and helpful.  I was able to get a good deal on the car I was looking for.  I was able to get the car I wanted and they even let me test drive it for me.  I couldn't be happier with my new car.  They also worked with me to get a great deal on the car.  I would recommend Lithia Hyundai of Reno to anyone"
Automotive,3.0,CG,I brought my car for a simple oil change and they did a great job. I was in and out within an hour and I was out within an hour. Thanks so much guys!I had a great experience with this place. The staff was friendly and professional. The staff was very helpful. They were able to answer all my questions and concerns. I definitely recommend this place. I will be back for my next oil change. I took my car here for an oil change and tire rotation. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was in and out in a timely manner. I would definitely go back here again. Horrible experience.
Automotive,4.5,CG,"This place is my favorite.  The guys here are knowledgeable, friendly, and the prices are affordable.  I had a bad experience with another dealer that was not happy about it and they were able to fix it in a few hours.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a new or used car.  I will be back!I had to wait 3 months for a part to come in to install a part that was on my order and a part I had to have it delivered to another store. The part came in at the same time.

Automotive,4.5,CG,"We were traveling from MI to NY and needed to get a full safety inspection done on our vehicle. We called the dealership and spoke with a very nice gentleman named ""Karen"". He was very professional and friendly. He explained what needed to be done and what to expect. The work was completed within 2 hours of our arrival and we were on our way home with our new vehicle. We will definitely be coming back here for any future vehicle needs. Thank you Karen!!We have been bringing our cars here for years, and have never been disappointed.  

We have a 2014 Toyota Corolla that we have owned for 3 years.  They have worked on it"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I went there for oil change. What a big disappointment!  They told me""  I may need to pay additional $500 for oil panchange because previous technician who did oil changed tighten up drain plug too tight due to using a wrong equipment""
I never had any problems like this. I decided to take my car to the mechanic at Ice cold air who usually does my oil change. In 30 seconds, he unscrew drain plug without problems and completed oil change within 15 min.

I am a small frame young Asian female. I feel that Toyota dealer attempted to rip me off because of my race and gender.

Toyota staff never showed me the proof of malfunctioned drain plug.
On the contrary, my car mechanic at ice cold air on Hillsborough simply unscrewed the screw which I witnessed."
Automotive,2.5,OR,DO NOT GET NO TYPE OF WAX ON YOUR CAR FROM THEM. The wax lasted 2-3 days and my car looks absolutely disgusting now a week later. I went to multiple car detailing companies and they all say $200 to get it removed my whole car needs to be decontaminated and needs a clay bar. So I asked the head women of the business what they going to do about it she said nothing you didn't get that from here it's from tree sap. I don't even park my park near any trees for 1 and 2 they the only people I let wash my car. Then after a argument the lady starts yelling in face attempting to hit me and the workers had to hold her back. EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. DO NOT GO TO.
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This is the only local tire shop I buy tires from anymore. They have great prices, especially if you can score a rebate which they do offer on occasion. I normally buy my tires from Blake but today he wasn't in so Brad and the manager, Mike helped me. They were both very helpful and friendly. Service for a re-balance this morning was very fast. So fast they were done before I finished with the paperwork for a different set of tires I was ordering. They are able to 'heat cycle' competition tires if you don't mind waiting while they get shipped to Arizona and back. The cycling cost the same as their competitors.
I am very picky when it comes to any of my car related stuff and this place has always taken care of me!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"All of the reviews were for Cleveland.  However, Tyrone arrived to clean the interior of my car.  He was late and the service was very poor.  He never flipped my back seats up to clean them, the carpet shampooing was bad, the overspray of cleaning supplies on my dashboard left my windshield a mess, there was no attention to detail in the cleaning.  For $120 for just the interior, I expected a reasonable cleaning and I was VERY disappointed.  I found a round plastic piece that matches my interior on the ground next to my car when he was done.  I have no idea where it came from?    I will never use them again but you can make your own decision if some other guy is available."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I had a great experience with Reindeer auto! I needed to relocate my car from Colorado to California and they were able to provide me with a competitive rate and a weekend pick-up without any hassle at all. My car was picked up on the morning I'd requested within the time window they'd provided and it was delivered the same day that they had estimated that it would arrive. The driver called me ahead of time to make sure I was home and ready to accept it and then asked me to inspect it with him to make sure I was satisfied. I understand that a lot of the car shipping process is luck of the draw with your drivers, but based on my experience Reindeer auto has this dialed in and I couldn't be happier!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Thank goodness for tire places like this when you need them, especially on the weekend. They have all sorts of tires both regular and run flats, both new and used. You  guys were we're definitely life savers late on a Saturday afternoon when 3 inch nails jump in the road out of no where (always happens that way). They went out of the way to assist us even though they did not take our tire protection plan. The tire service guys here are extremely efficient and work to get you back on the road quickly. The only down fall with this place is that they are cash only with an ATM inside and then you get charged all the fees from the banks. This would be 5 stars if not for the cash only policy."

I went in to get an oil change and I was told that they have a ""good"" deal on oil changes. I told them that I wanted a change and asked if I could drop off my car and they said no. I was told that they would call me right back. I called back later that afternoon and was told that I had to go to the dealership because they couldn't find the correct oil for me. I asked why the price for a oil change was not the price I was quoted. They said it was a mistake on my part because it was only"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"The guys at the front desk were professional and very friendly.  

The mechanic said he would check the oil and replace the filter and then the car would be ready by 5:00.  

The next day, I drove around with my two young kids and found the oil filter was not changed and it had been changed.  

I had to take it back for a second opinion and they insisted that they did not change the filter and that they would not check the oil for any other reason.  I told them I was going to make it a point to take it to a different mechanic and they said it was not.

Automotive,2.5,CG,"One star because someone spoke to me and let me know I need to make a reservation to go to a airport.  The driver then said that they have a ""good day"" and that it's okay to come in.  

I then called to check on how long it would take to get my car to the airport.  The person on the phone said it would take about an hour.  I asked if it would take about an hour.  I got there and it took them about an hour and a half.  I'm not sure why the wait time was so long.  They were friendly and friendly.  I left my car there to get picked"
Automotive,3.5,CG,This is a very nice location. The guys are friendly and professional. They have a nice selection of new and used cars. I will definitely be back!I bought a used car from this dealership. I told them I would be interested in it. I was told it was in the inventory and it would be a few weeks. I went in to the dealership to speak to a sales manager and was told that they were not interested in the car. I told him I would not be interested in it and would be looking at it. I was told that they would not honor the deal that they had made and that they would have to wait for it. They could not honor the offer
Automotive,1.5,CG,Beware! Sold me old tires and broke the lug nut. Took it to a different mechanic and they said that the lug nut was stripped. Not only that but the lug nut was stripped. They said it was not fixed. I will never buy from them again. I was in town for a wedding. I was heading to NY and I had a flat tire. I called AAA and they were very helpful. They got me in right away. They told me that I needed new tires and it would take about an hour. The staff was very nice and helpful. I was able to drop off my car and get it back. They even gave me a ride home.
Automotive,3.5,CG,"I read all the great reviews on here and knew exactly what I wanted and how to get the best deal. I had a great experience at this dealership, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was in and out in under an hour and they even gave me a ride home while my car was being worked on. I'm very happy with my experience here and will be coming back to them again for all of my car needs. I'm not sure why I am giving them a negative review but I'm definitely not going to post it because of my experience."
Automotive,3.5,CG,I had control arms installed here. The guys were friendly and professional. When I got home the front passenger side was not aligned. The guys took the time to explain the problem and made sure it was okay. It was fixed in a matter of minutes. I will be back.I would give a zero if I could.  I went in to get a simple tire fix and they told me my tire had to be replaced.  They told me I needed a new tire and that they could do it for $75.  I walked out of there and got a new tire.  They are rude and do not care.  I will not go back.I bought a 2019
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Sales dept. not good. I had an appointment with them and was told by my sales guy that he would get back to me in the next couple of hours. I never received a call back. I was told by the sales guy that he was working on the sale and that he would have the vehicle ready to go for a test drive. I had to call back several times to get the vehicle and was told that he was not there and that they didn't have a vehicle in stock. I was told that they had a lot of inventory, but they did not have a vehicle in stock. I went to the dealership and had a different salesman call me back."
Automotive,1.5,CG,"I rented a Ford Focus here last week. The salesman was nice and knowledgeable about the vehicle. The salesperson was helpful, informative and knowledgeable. The first time I went to the dealership I was greeted by a salesman named Josh. Josh was very helpful and friendly. Josh was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and also made me feel comfortable with the financing. Josh made me feel comfortable with the purchase. I would highly recommend this dealership. This is a great place to get your car washed. The staff is friendly and helpful. I got a great deal and a great deal. I would go back. Do not buy a car from this dealership."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Last month (11/2019) I went to have a remote starter installed on my 2011 Infiniti M56. I must say, Steve and his team did an amazing/ wonderful job. Steve took the time to explained the 3 different remote starters for my vehicle and didn't suggest the most expensive one in which I found honorable. Most places will try to sell you the most expensive item just to make a buck. I wanted a practical remote starter in which I do from my house and incorporate into my existing key fob. After installation, Steve came out and walked me through the process and how the remote starter works. He also told me they stand behind their product. I will continue to use them for all my audio and customization in the future. Thanks for a great experience Steve."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Had a engine repair done, then after a couple days, the same problem showed up again, called them about this, but this time they were to busy to look at it, and the owner was not in to talk to me. I day later, I called, and got the same thing. So I took the car to the dealer, told them what happened over and over. They looked into the problem, and come to find out, the car was repaired with a used part, not a new one like I was charged. So I had the dealer fix this correct. NOW, I'm not out a ton of money, but I have filed with the state to look into this. I'll never go back. This auto repair business is cutting corners to make the most money off people."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"The need for a quick tire plug sent me in search of an auto repair shop. Drove by 2 local places, one who quoted a couple hour wait time & the other needing a next day appointment + a $33 (insane) quote. Drove to All Pro who squeezed me in & had me out in 10 minutes. The shop was clean, the staff courteous & professional. BTW they also did it as a complimentary no charge.
  
  What they weren't aware of is that I'm newer to the area & in need of finding a local mechanic who I become loyal to. The last one I used in NJ for 25 years is just too far. I had a good overall vibe about All Pro. Jim & staff, I'll be back for future auto needs."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"One of the worst experiences trying to buy a vehicle. Worked out numbers to the T, only asked them to put my down payment on the buyers order as I was coming from 2 hours away and wanted to send it to my financing so she could get started. Spoke to 3 different people ALL were well aware that I had my own financing, hence why I needed the buyers order correct. Fill up my trade-in and get on the interstate only to get a call from a ""manager"" saying that if I didn't use their financing the deal was off. Complete was of hours last night and time, money and miles on my trade in this morning. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM IF THEY SAY THERES NO WAY THE NUMBERS WILL CHANGE ONCE YOU'RE ON THE WAY."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"If I could give this place less than one star I absolutely would, the only reason is the white lady that works there with blonde hair and looks like she smokes 3 packs a day. She is hands down one of the worst gas station workers I have ever run into. I have absolutely no idea why they have not fired her yet, but I would say it's a good time to let her go. She has no people skills and every time I walk into that place and see her working I walk right back out. She is with out a doubt the worst, and if she cannot properly deal with customers she should not have a job at that location anymore. Y'all seriously need to either have a talk with her or let her go."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I brought my car in to Car-X late one Monday afternoon (during a huge rainstorm), because my oil light had come on.  The power had gone out at my ""regular place"" up the street, so I ran into Car-X.  I was greeted by Mr. Davis who looks very young, but he is so very professional and attentive to my concerns.  He assured me that they would not close until all the issues were taken care of.  THEN, the technician came in from the garage, and invited me to come in and look over my car with him.  He pointed things out that I needed to be aware of, but let me know the things he was going to repair as of that day.  This had NEVER happened before in my life!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Good tires at good prices, but their 'reservation' system is a farce, therefore three stars. I bought a set of tires early one afternoon, but I'd have to wait more than an hour to mount them. I asked about a reservation for first thing next morning, but they were all taken.The salesman said I could make a reservation for later that day, which I did. When I arrived at the appointed time, the wait was still over an hour. Obviously, they did not reserve a time slot for me, just put me back in line with the other buyers, I didn't wait. The next morning I showed up early before they opened, the first one there. When they opened, they took me right away, bumping buyers with reservations. Even with good tires, they ruined my customer satisfaction."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Beware the bait and switch. Bought a Groupon for $15 to get an oil change at this place. When I get there to do a synthetic blend oil change they want $80 less the value of my Groupon which now makes the oil change 65. I called my car dealer and found out that they would do an oil change plus a full tire rotation for 49. Jiffy Lube is a rip off

Follow up. As important as it is to inform fellow consumers through social media when there is a problem with a retailer, it is equally important to update a review for any follow on actions that have occurred. I was contacted by Jiffy Lube customer service and they went beyond the call of duty and completely resolved the issue to my satisfaction."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I was buying a used RV in the Tuscon area and hired Frost RV to do the inspection and even some subsequent work after the purchase. I later discovered an issue and, speaking with Gordon at Frost RV, we determined they had made a mistake. While certainly not happy with the mistake (why they're only getting 4 and not 5 stars), I have to say Gordon's level of transparency in working with me to figure out what happened and the fact that he did the right thing to correct it, was refreshing and really appreciated. I run a services business and outstanding customer service isn't about not making mistakes- it's actually about how you react to those mistakes and what you do to correct it to the best of your ability."

I will definitely use them again!I had to wait 3 months for a part to come in to install a part that was on my order. It's been almost 3 weeks and I still haven't received the part.

Automotive,4.0,CG,"Bait you to get you into an expensive car, try to negotiate a fair price, and just try to get you into a nice car.  The car you're buying is in great condition, and it's not in good condition.  They are going to sell it to you for $1,000 less than what the online price is.  I've never had a bad experience here, and I will never go to any other dealer.  I've been to other dealerships before, but this is one of the best.  I'll definitely be back, and I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about them too!I love this place. They are always busy"

They had very good reviews. When she called they were helpful and provided her with a quote. They also said they could squeeze it in this week and that it would take about 45 minutes. That was perfect because wanted to be able to use our trailer over the weekend. We scheduled for Friday at 1pm. 

We arrived a little before 1pm, dropped off the truck and left to complete some errands and get lunch. We were called to let us know the truck was ready just as we were finishing up at 1:44pm. Almost exactly 45 minutes as quoted.

Overall the process was quick and easy and the price was reasonable."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Not sure why so many fellow customers have their panties in a bunch, but this gas station is actually pretty good! I like that their prices are competitive, and I always get in and out pretty quick (I like paying inside, not at the pump). I don't consume tobacco products and I've never purchased alcohol here, but it seems legit that they card for both. I'd like to see this location stick around, so if they are a law-abiding business and actually carding people, I'm fine with that! If you're an upstanding citizen, surely you'll understand why that's necessary :) That said, the employees here have always been kind, and your standard convenience store selection is decent, too! Also conveniently located on Kietzke & Peckham near Grocery Outlet, Savers, Dollar Tree, & Harbor Freight, right by the Atlantis!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"IF YOU WANT TO BUY A VEHICLE, LOOK ELSEWHERE!! This dealership is an absolute joke. The sales manager Mike is a clown. Salespeople are unprofessional and rude. I spent 4 hours at the dealership, drove the car around and even backed it into the show room floor. As I was getting ready to sign for the truck, I am told that this truck is sold and no longer available. They then had the audacity to ask if I wanted a different model truck. These people just want to make a sell, don't care about trust or honesty. It's a shame they have this brand new building and will be out of business soon. 

Ended up going to another dealership up the road the following day and got a nicer truck for less money and much smoother buying process."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"I have purchased two cars from this dealership and both times were a great experience. They worked with me to get me to a payment I felt comfortable with and were very fair with offers. I have never had a bad experience here. When you walk in you are never waiting too long for someone to come and help you. The staff there are quite knowledgeable and answer all my millions of questions. I have never felt rushed there either. The service department is always great as well. They have a nice drop off system as well. They are usually running on time, an occasional back up but never horrific. This dealership makes me never want to deal with any other one because I have and it was not nearly as pleasant. I adore my second outlander sport!"

Very easy to get to in Tampa using the address in GPS. Corner open lot that is secure fenced. Attendants immediately assisted with parking us and putting bags in the van. Thank you Rodrick for the help! Short trip to terminal after the driver showed us exactly where he would pick us up. He left cell number in case of issues. After tour, they were waiting at the spot! Loaded us quickly and we were on our way! Used extra money on the cruise!!!!

Pros: Cost, assistance, promo code
Cons: Gate on lot was open and did not have controlled access, van a little dusty but cool.

Chaz and the guys at Monroe really took care of me. I have a 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser that was missing the back half of the exhaust. They understood that I didn't want to dump a ton of money into an 18 year old truck. They were able to custom make a solution and now the truck runs so quiet that I can't even tell it's running. The guys at Monroe save me a lot of money and also gave me tips on why my check engine light was on. Generally speaking I'm not much on chain automobile repair shops but these guys are great.

I should have known something was wrong when he kept calling me telling me, we have what your looking for and we can get you in it today.  Kept asking, so when are you coming here.  I called the general manager to make my complaint, and give them a chance to make things right.  He wasn't in so I left me name and number and asked that he call me back.  He never has, so obviously they don't care to do business with me."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Interesting. I noticed on my last visit when leaving that they did not vacuum my car and I guess they didn't clean windows. This time they ask if I want to upgrade to the signature service for $5. When I inquire what that includes. They tell me it includes a vacuum and window wash.  They told me that they quit vacuum and window washing in January and they just began signature service offer a month ago.  Interesting how large businesses can make changes that reflect the bottom line so meaninglessly while losing customers over principal. As someone who drives 35,000+ miles annually and gets an oil change along with other maintenance done about every 6 weeks Jiffy Lube will now only be a last resort for me in case of emergency.  What a horrible business decision."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"What an easy and comfortable buying experience.  No pressure, and no insane extra dealer fees. Last week I walked out of Lokey Nissan because they tried to tact on 7k worth of extra fees, even after I told them what the max I was willing to spend.  This went way above my budget, why show a car that will end up being way above what I am willing to spend.  Tyrone Square Mazda showed me cars in my price range, and did not tact on any additional crazy fees.  I was able to get a newer Nissan Altima SV at Tyrone Square Mazda for 5K cheaper  than what Lokey Nissan wanted for a Nissan Sentra S.  For a non stressful shopping experience, without any additional hidden fees I 100% recommend Tyrone Square Mazda,"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I was looking for a car and my friend recommended Kaners Motor (In Philadelphia) to see if they can help. We met to see what they have in stock. Well, I purchased my new car on the spot. Konstantin answered all my questions and helped me make up my mind upon getting my new sedan. The car has had a lot repairs to it, so we took it for the drive to testing it out . The only thing I would need to replace is the set of new tires for upcoming season. We negotiated the price and I got my registration ready on the same day. If you looking for a descent used car,  I would recommend of checking their inventory online  and going for an appointment to see if they might have wheels for you."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"I ended up at Tampa Honda because I thought the folks at the dealership were really nice and helpful. I had a great experience at Tampa Honda, and I'm sure I will be back. I'd recommend Tampa Honda for anyone looking for a car. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was in and out in under an hour and they even gave me a ride home while my car was being worked on. I'm very happy with my experience here. We have been bringing our cars here for service for years. They are honest and upfront about what is wrong with your vehicle. They will work with you on a price and not try to up sell you."

Automotive,4.5,CG,Bought my Lexus SUV  here a couple years ago. I will admit that I have been pretty nervous since I have had the vehicle for a year but the sales department was great. The sales department was great and the finance department was great. They even gave me a loaner car for the day. I will continue to do business with them and I will recommend them to anyone I know. I just went there to purchase a used vehicle and they did everything they could to make me feel comfortable and happy. I highly recommend the Lexus of Tampa Bay team for your next vehicle purchase. I had a great experience with AutoNation Nissan. The sales team was very helpful and very helpful.
Automotive,2.5,CG,Needed to get my car checked out and the oil change was quick and simple. I was in and out within an hour and I was out in less than 30 minutes. The staff was very friendly and professional and the waiting area was comfortable. I would definitely come back to this location for any vehicle maintenance.I have been going to them for years.  They are honest and reliable.  They do great work and I highly recommend them to anyone.  They will do everything they can to help you out.  You won't regret it.  They also have a great website.  You can always get a coupon for $20 off a regular oil change.  It's a great location
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I paid for the top of the line car wash. I will not be going back.I've been using this company for years, and they're the best.  They do a great job and are friendly.  They're always honest about what is going on with your car.  They don't try to sell you stuff you don't need and they don't try to upsell you.  I've never had an issue with any of the services that I've had done on my car, and they've been quick to respond.  They also have a great website that you can use to get your oil changed.  The prices are fair and I'm very happy with their service."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"We were in Reno on a family vacation.  As we tried heading back to California our Engine light went on.  We decided to take it to BMW dealer to avoid getting ripped off by possible unkown mechanics in the area.  We drove it to Bill Pearce BMW and met with Ms. Christy Ross.   She understood our circumstances and realized we were stranded with two kids.  With her help and the help of the mechanics, they fixed our car the same day.  Shuttle service was provided both ways.  Communication and getting us back on the road was excellent.    This story will definitely go on our books!  

P.S.  I don't think our kids knew what we were possibly facing, but they were excited to go to the ""BMW Dealership""."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This review is based on the service department. 
After visiting an annoying salesperson here I chose to drive an hour to Brandon to get my new Mazda. 

Back to service... they do it! 
I've had my oil changed and tire rotation completed a few times here. The service techs are friendly and quick to attend the customer when you arrive.  I haven't had them force an up sale like other dealerships. 

The waiting area is a adequate space - complete with complementary water and coffee. It's nice that they leave the remote for the television- you can change the channel and lower the volume. There's free WiFi, tables and a sofa. It's not over the top - but it's functional. 

At least for the basic routine maintenance and recall repairs, I'd recommend Tyrone Mazda. I've been happy with them."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I was driving through DE on my way to MD when a piece of the I-95 10-year construction project caused my tire to blow.  After AAA helped me with my spare, I drove (slowly) to three different tire stores - none of which had my particular tire in stock.  I came to Sheridan fully expecting I would have to spend the night somewhere in Wilmington.  Allen called around and found the one tire in the whole *&#@ state that fit my Fiesta!  He and the service team were incredibly friendly, and I was back on the road in no time - not to mention, my bill was surprisingly reasonable.  I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't stopped here.  These guys took a stressful situation and made it so much better!"
Automotive,5.0,OR,"From the minute he picked up the phone, it was obvious that Brandon is someone who takes great pride in his work.  I took my car to Slate Detail because I was about to give it to my Dad to drive, and it was important to me that the car look fantastic when handing the keys back to the guy who raised me.  Brandon went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that everything was perfect--even the car's engine bay, which probably hadn't been cleaned more than once over the twelve years I drove it.  

In short, I couldn't have been happier with the quality of Brandon's work, and on top of all that, he is a family man and a genuinely nice guy. I am happy to give Slate Detail my highest recommendation."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"These guys are awesome. I needed new tires and was dreading going and sitting at a tire place, or dropping my car off and being without transportation for a day. Found these guys online and took a chance. Couldn't be happier. I bought 4 new tires from them through their website and scheduled a time for them to come by my house in Sylvan Park and install them. They arrived right on time and replaced all 4 tires in about 30 minutes, right in my driveway. They were also just super professional and nice. I'm never buying tires in a store again. This is just hands down a better way to get tires.  Also, price was right in line with the quotes I got from firestone and tire discounters. So you're not even paying a premium for the convenience."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"The backbone of any good automotive place is the staff. It's hard to know if/when you can trust the recommendations.  After two visits to Clarke, I've gotta say, the staff are so professional, polite, and efficient.  Both times, we were told our cars were running well.  I feel like most auto shops find a small list of repairs each time you go, but not here.  

The service in regards to timing was also very professionally handled.  They offer appointments for oil changes and get your car done in 30-40 minutes.  We dropped it off, walked down to Einstein Bagel, came back in 30 mins and it was ready!  Can't beat that!  No time is wasted!  

All in all, I am very happy to have found this place!  Thank you, Clarke!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"The guys at MAW are the best! I was caring for a sick friend in Whiting and didn't know the area so I took my dirty car to a car wash on route 70. I must have reminded the guy in charge of his ex wife or something because he was extremely nasty and said I didn't have an appointment there. He said I must have called someplace else. When I offered to show him my phone so he could see that I had in fact called their business he refused to look at it. So I opened my phone and hit their number and their phone rang. The desk guy answered it and I said ""It's me dude!"" Then I left.
So now I go to Medford Auto Wash. Fantastic service! Friendly accommodating staff and the did a wonderful job!"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Cisco got me fixed up and back on the road in no time. Thank you!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change.  The guy was not happy about it and was just trying to make it right.  
I told him I was still waiting and would be leaving soon.  He said I could get a free car wash and I would come back later.  I went there to pick up my car and they didn't have a car in the lot.  I had to wait for the car.  I told him I was coming back later in the day to get my car.  He said he couldn't find my car and he would call me back."

I called to schedule an appointment but was told a service advisor would be calling me back to schedule a time. Seemed a little weird and inefficient as now I had to wait for a phone call instead of making the appointment right then... 4 days later and no call so not a good first impression. I finally made my appointment online easily and was helped by Carlos when I went in. He was very helpful and friendly and was able to answer all my questions easily!

Automotive,4.0,OR,"It's unfortunate that April isn't there anymore. She had outstanding customer service.
My problem with them is my car was demonstrated with active cruise control by April. Tesla removed it since the car was sold by a third party. It costs 3,000 to reinstall.
I have called Bayshore numerous times first i was told they didn't know that. They were moving etc. They are the dealer and they should have known that. I have spoken to Dave who was very nice.  He was checking on what they can do. They have never returned my calls since as to the cruise control. 
I have had a number of problems such as having the rap coming off within a couple of months. April called Rob  at PCA. Rob now tells me after all this time that my problem is between me and Bayshore."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I've had my car broken into twice this week period same window, same idiot I can't figure out I don't leave anything in my car. 

Having already spent $200  on this stupid window, I  was desperate to save as much money as possible. 

This time I called around and read a bunch of reviews.

Father & son gave me the lowest  quote- $85 - and the lady on the phone was very nice. I knew it was going to be used glass but my car is 13 years old, so whatever. 

Took 15 mins and they did a great job!!

It looks exactly the same as the $200 window I got earlier this week. I should have gone here instead.

I hope I never have to go back there again but at least now I know there's a reliable, cheap(er) solution."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Went on Saturday 9-9 to test drive a Rogue and see what kind of deal could be made.  The salesman comes back with my registration and Insurance card.  These things were inside the center console so the only way to find them is if he looked through my car.  Also, I had a statement regarding my current car in a portfolio on the passenger seat. I never said anything about that but it was obvious he looked through it.  I WON'T go back to 422 Nissan 

I got a response to my review and was told to call 610-628-0886 to discuss further.  Dials the number 5 times to make sure I was doing correctly and the number is not in service.  Guess it is a standard response with a fake number because they don't care."

What is normally a painstaking process of paperwork, insurance verifications, finance issues, etc. has gone without a problem for the last 4 cars I have purchased.  And their Service Department is without a doubt, the best in the Philly/South Jersey area.  I have always been treated professionally and fairly.  I TRUST them beyond a doubt!  As a woman, I have been taken advantage of by other dealerships, but SofCH never tries to ""upsell me"" on some useless preventive service or told me that I had multitudes of other issues with my car that needed to be serviced! Hard to believe there is actually a car dealership that is HONEST...but SofCH is the BEST!!  GO...you won't be sorry!"

I called the dealership and spoke with two salesmen and the sales manager and they said they would be able to get me in the next day. I spoke to a sales manager named James and he stated they would have the vehicle I wanted and they would order it. I had to call James several times to check in. I was told the vehicle I was interested in was on the lot and that I would have to come back to the dealership for a test drive. I called James again and he said he would get back to me. I called back the following day and James said he would call me back. I was told that he would

Automotive,4.0,OR,"I was surprised to see some of the negative reviews of Private party cars.  I have always had very good success with buying and selling cars here.  They are very clear about what services they offer and what that cost will be.  I understand that my vehicle may or may not sell and that is not the fault of PPC.  What I like is that I don't have to meet a potential buyer in a sketchy parking lot or at my home and take them for a test drive.  Also, they are very knowledgeable about pricing my vehicle so that I can get a sale.  When I do get a sale they help with the paperwork and answer any questions about transfer of title, etc...

Automotive,2.0,OR,"I broke down last night while whipping down the expressway from Ambler into New Jersey when I lost a belt in my BMW.  Careful not to let it overheat, I sat in the median and made a plan - get to Linnett's Gulf, the service center in my old hood of Fairmount.  After a few miles of driving and stopping to cool down my battery went.  Triple A was my next hope, as there was no way to continue driving. The dispatch operator asked, ""Can Triple A suggest a serice cener?""  I said sure. She replied, Linnet's."" Enough said.

The next morning, as this all happened at nine o'clock at night, my car was soon repaired - in a timely fashion and for the right price-  and finshed by 1pm per my request!

Does it get better than that?"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"My experience at your Clearwater Fucillo was the worst that I've been met with in years. I will be purchasing a new vehicle however it will never be with your dealership. Absolutely no consumer consideration no matter what the appraisal is or terms etc. Salesman was ok Vincent ""appraiser"" basically didn't have one minute to introduce himself nor explain the details of why the feedback relayed by the salesman was unfavorable. I am an accountant for twenty five years and came in with the reconciliation and loan versus how it would be delivered by your staff. Poor and I always pride myself on staying positive and understand my situation. The experience sucked and your dealerships will not get a dime of my family'sbusiness nor will I avoid networking with the young business professional organization I belong to and am the Treasurer of."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"When was the last time you took your car to be inspected and you pick it up the same day and nothing had to be repaired or replaced?  Exactly.
Paying just the price of the sticker and emissions is pretty refreshing and if that doesn't make your day nothing will.  Now this can't happen all the time of course, but once in a while would be good.  Pat's specializes in BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar but gladly works on almost any foreign and domestic auto with equal facility.  They'll flatbed your car if necessary, at a cost of course, and their service is outstanding.  These are 5 good mechanics and they all appear to be excellent diagnosticians, seeming to know where to look just by the sound of you pulling up.  Outstanding group of accomplished and ethical mechanics."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Just got my Jeep detailed in this place. I had The Complete package, $300 for it. I called the shop to schedule a time to drop my car off. And picked up my car the next day. When the car was presented to me it looked brand new! I was in shock. Both inside and outside was new and shiny. They even cleaned the mud tray in the back of my trunk as well as the food tray I left in there LOL. The only thing I would like to see some improvement is that too much oil was used in some corners that I can see puddle of oil sitting there. But other than this everything is awesome!

Would recommend this place to my friends, and would def come back next time even though back and forth Uber costed me $70."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"My wife and I visited this location on a Friday from 2 hours away to check out a vehicle we were very interested in.  Needing to work out some details of the financing over the next few days, we left without buying the car, but with a commitment from them that they would give a heads up if someone else was interested in the vehicle over the next few days. We had multiple communications with Fred Beans over next few days, arranged a loan, had a check in hand, and called them to tell them that we would be there on Friday to buy the vehicle. We received a call from them on Thursday evening saying that the vehicle had been sold out from under us. No heads up, no apologies, and apparently no sense of decency. Don't trust this place."

We were buying a car for our soon to be 16 year old daughters birthday.   Not to mention, I was celebrating my 40th Birthday today.    Needless to say, I was furious!

I told them I wanted it to be free and the mechanic told me that I needed it for $60. I went to the dealership and they told me that it was $60. They told me that it was a battery and that I should pay $60. I said I didn't need it, and that I would have to pay $90 for labor. They said that they would be taking care of it"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Service center: this is literally the only bad experience I've ever had with anything associated with Subaru. I scheduled a simple oil change on my day off. First off, the person on the phone gave me a hard time about scheduling an appointment because he claimed I wouldn't need one and could just come use their ""express service."" Much to his frustration, I insisted on an appointment bc I didn't want to wait too long. I made a 2pm appointment, arrived on time and STILL had to wait 2 hours to get my car a simple oil change bc the car ""in front of mine had issues."" The people in the store were very kind but what is the point of an appointment if it's still going to take 2 hours. If you bring your car here, make sure you clear your schedule."

Thanks to Justin - our vehicle specialist - for making our 4Runner search across the lot smooth & stress free, Beth - our sales manager - for coordinating a no pressure car sale offer that fit our financial needs, Jeremy - our finance manager - for explaining the important details of our options and providing loan documents and other forms that were ready to read and sign, and last but not least, Cole - our delivery specialist - who took an hour and a half to teach us every cool feature about our 2015 Premium 4Runner!

Automotive,4.5,OR,"These guys are great!  I normally hate buying tires because all the major tire chains try to gouge customers with inflated prices, both on the tires and the installation.  I'm thorough in my research so I know what is a fair price.  This time when buying tires, I thought I'd give Mill Street Tire a try and called them for a price on the tires I wanted and they quoted a great price!  No haggling, no BS.  By the afternoon they had the tires delivered and the next morning my wife took her car to the shop to have them installed.

I'll definitely go to Mill Street Tire in the future for all my tire needs, and maybe I'll try some of their other services too since they seem to be an honest shop, which is hard to find."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"The Shiloh, IL location is the absolute worst. They charge dealership prices for diagnosis and repairs and then do a terrible job of providing services. Then there's the players (staff). Tim, the service manager, is in charge of this band of idiot service technicians. Tim's role is to explain away any mishaps the technicians make. They push the 'lifetime service products' , however , they never attribute any of your vechicle's problems to that service again even when it applies. And by the way, this location is family owned so there is NO ONE to hear or even cares to hear customer complaints. I really believe this location is not even worthy of one star. We're it not for the demographics of the area, they'd be OUT OF BUSINESS. All I can say in a nutshell when visiting this location is BUYER BEWARE."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Suncoast credit union year after year takes massive strides in making their banks more and more useless, from only staffing their banks with two tellers, to not ""servicing"" home loan applications at some branches and then last but not least not offering cash transactions at this location. That's right, if you're looking to deposit a large sum of money, large enough that you would prefer to not use an ATM, you cannot simply go into this bank and deposit your money as it is a ""security feature."" Utterly ridiculous. This is not a bank that you should consider if you'd like access to services regarding larger sums of money, that's as simple as I can state it. I'll be transferring all of my assets and will have another financial institution buy out my $85,000 in car loans I have with them. I'm done."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I'm a car guy and a bit of a control freak especially when it comes to my vehicles. I don't have the right tools to balance a tire at home, so I am forced to use a shop. Mavis in Langhorne (formerly STS) is the only place I'll go now. I had them put some tires on my new truck and they had some issues - the tires were heavy and hard to balance. They rebalanced them for me at no cost and are committed to replacing them if they don't stay in balance. The manager Josh is a car guy, and the foreman Ken clearly cares about his customers. If you need tires or state inspection (at a much more reasonable price than the dealership) don't go anywhere else. Talk with Ken and they will make sure you are taken care of."

I bought a used car and was very happy with it. I spoke with a salesman and told him I was interested in getting the car I was looking at. He said it was a ""platinum package"". I asked if they could get the key for me and he said it was. I told him that I was interested in getting it for me. He said that they would get it for me and call me when it was ready.

I had a bad experience with the dealership, and I'm sure it's because of the fact that the salespeople are horrible. 

I had to go in for a simple oil change and was told the oil change would take about 3 hours. I was told the oil change was free, but I had to go to the dealership because it was too much for me to do. I was told that the car had a oil leak and that it was ""fine"" to get it fixed.

I will never buy a car from here again. I bought my car here and it's been a nightmare. First, I got my car washed and then I took it to another car wash. I was told it would be $25. 00.

Automotive,4.0,OR,I came in for an oil change and the service was the best I have had in a very long time.  Because I am a woman many places take advantage of that by trying to convince me that I should have more than what I ask for.  But today I did have other things done I was given a great discount on my work and I will definitely be back to have other things done with my truck. Robert and Patrick was the best today and highly recommended others to come to them for service on your vehicles. Thank you for your honesty and great service today. My vehicle is my job and I need to get my vehicle ready for my customers to be comfortable and safe so I just want to say that I really am glad I stopped in.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I took my dead Volvo here to be revitalized before selling. The mechanic quoted me roughly $300 or so for a new battery with labor. I said go ahead, because it was necessary. I get a call later and he says I need a new breather box. I ask him how much it is, he says, clear as day, about $75. I went to pick up today and realized he LIED to me. It was about 10x that. The cashier, a caucasian lady, was extremely friendly and sympathetic. She did her best to reduce my bill as much as she could. The African American gentleman there was also sincere and offered apologies and support as well. The mechanic that quoted me this price is an absolute fraud, and I will tell everyone I know looking for a new vehicle about this dealership."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Today, I took my 2018 Sonata to the service department. It was not a pleasant experience. My car is 8 months old. It got its first oil change. I liked that the first one is free. However, I also had the inspection done to my car as well. I was told by the salesman when I bought the car that I would get free inspections for the life of my car. It was duplicitous! As it turns out, it is only the state part of the inspection that is complimentary. It got a bill for $72.63 for the emissions and the stickers. I tried to rectify this with the service manager, but to no avail and to the sales department. My local mechanic charged about this for my whole inspection for my old car! I left very upset and disappointed. Take your business elsewhere."

I feared the worst, and Central helped me feel at ease by telling me exactly what they would do, how much it would cost, etc. They offered my boyfriend and I a beverage as soon as we came in and were very prompt, professional, and kind. They made me feel like a priority. I came back the next weekend after the estimate, and they informed me that buffing it took less time than they thought and that they took that off the price. Even the original estimate was very fair. They gave me extra touch up paint as well. I am a 100% satisfied customer!"

Automotive,2.5,OR,"$100 worth of diagnostic fees to check 
1) an oil leak  +  2) air has stopped coming out of vents when AC is on.  

Diagnosis:
1) I need an oil change & new filter 
2) they want an extra $55 to figure out why no air is coming out of the vents. 
   
Also got ""sold"" the $9.99 discounted complete inspection.  Pretty sure you (like me) can count on them finding hundreds of dollars worth of additional ""issues"" they recommend to be taken care of.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"This may look like a dirty grungy shop, but its what's inside that counts. A great staff and service that is second to none are just some of the things I noticed here while I waited on my car. No need for an appointment, just drive up and you are likely to get rushed right in. I came in for a muffler bracket and they informed me that I would have to wait a week for a replacement if they could get it. I opted for a new muffler they could make work with one of their own brackets and have me on my way in a half hour!

Excuse my language but BULLSHIT. You have to read every fine print. A car worth $9,000 they will charge you $13,000 and before you know it when you look at your car payment instead of seeming $13,000 you'll end up paying $17,000. They detail the car but they don't fix the important things. They are a dishonest dealership trying to get to your pockets and get that car off the lot. Don't buy any other brand name cars from them just buy a Hyundai because that's what they specialized in. The sellers are disrespectful and tend to be pushy. Everyone has their own opinion and this is just mine from my experience."

I showed the service manager documents indicating that I mentioned a problem with my vehicle last time I brought it in prior to the same issue that was related to the repair today. My car was under the warranty the last time but not now. Also the main part that failed,(wheel bearings) were failing when I had my warranty and I asked to have the niose I heard addressed. They did nothing then and when I mentioned this to the service manger he blamed previous staff and did nothing to try and make their mistake right,(other than tell me to make a claim on my extended warranty). I have taken my car to Walker religiously for all repairs but am rethinking this now."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I had a surprisingly great experience here, so I felt I had to share.  After doing research online, I found out this is one of a few auto supply stores that will install windshield wipers for free if you purchase them directly from them.

Because I am a nerd, I read windshield wiper reviews and wrote down which ones I was interested in. When I walked in the store, I was greeted immediately. They did not have my first choice wiper available (it was back-ordered) but they did have my second choice in stock. The wipers happened to be on sale too, which is always an added bonus.

After I purchased the new wipers, the sales clerk walked out to my car with me, and had my new wipers on my car in less than two minutes.  I wish every auto interaction was this effortless!"

Our salesman Anthony walked us through all the features of the car including all the bells and whistles, including the mechanics of the car up to the time where we drove away. He even stayed with us past closing time to make sure we fully understood how to navigate the internal GPS system.

Thank you all!I just went there to have my car serviced. I have a 2012 Mazda 3 that I purchased from them. The service writer (I think his name was John) was great.

I did get a free car wash on my trade-in, but I was not expecting to have to deal with that.

No apology, no offering to have me pay for it and courier the item, what I got is go to Carefree RV, they probably have some in stock. Oh, and no offer to contact them on my behalf so that I don't make a further unnecessary trip. Guess what, they were right, Carefree had it and that is where I am going from here on. Not even going to go into my older experiences with this so called company. Surprised they are still in business."

After being retired from the military for so long, you don't always carry an id around. I own a restaurant and would never ask a military vet to show me their ID, it's the golden rule and if people steal valor they have bigger problems. You guys are selling car washes, not cars so how big of savings is it really? I was a loyal customer and always the ultimate wash, but I'll find another. It wasn't the couple of dollar difference, it was the response and service."

Then after arguing with him for a few minutes he told me to go fuck myself. Which by the way, I didn't cuss at him once. Obviously never going to use this towing company even if it were the last means to tow my car. Any company that let's their employees talk to anyone like this, isn't worth my money.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Once they opened it up, I transferred my loyalty in a flash.  Not that I was dissatisfied with the great service of the one on David Drive, but this one is a lot closer to home.  It's fast. I think they advertise that it is a 4 minute wash.  Driving across the Causeway for a week during the bug season, the front grill always looks bad.  They provide a bug soap you can scrub on the front grill and windshield prior to the car wash.  It does work.  It's a little more effort on your part, but I figure it is worth it.  Then after the car wash, it's time to use the vacuum to clean the inside.  I now have a clean car, until the next time I have to drive across the lake for a week."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Bob and the guys at C & J are what you want your local mechanic to be: friendly, professional, honest, thorough, and fairly priced.  Every time I've called or stopped in, they greet me by name (and I can tell you it's not because I am a frequent customer - they do this for everyone).  The work is quality and the prices are equal to (or better than) the dealers I have used.  Whenever there's an issue, they are quick to make it right.  Their busy parking lot definitely indicates their reputation.  The location is within walking distance to the train, so it is easy to drop off for the day and pick up in the evening.

While I no longer commute by train (thereby making it harder to schedule a day to leave the car), I am on my third vehicle being serviced there."

They said it would be ready by the end of the week. I had to go home to get it back and they kept it for two weeks. I picked it up the next day and when I got it back the same day, I noticed that the tail light was off.

They have a very clean waiting room with coffee and water. The waiting room is comfortable and with a comfortable lounge. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend them.This is the worst car dealership I have ever dealt with. We are very loyal customers and we have never felt any pressure to buy. Our salesperson was not upfront about the car and instead he went out of his way to help us get a good deal. We bought a pre-owned BMW from them and now"

I called back and waited a half hour for the service to be completed.  I received a call from a gentleman named Andrew, who had told me that I needed to pay $120 for a tow.  I asked if they could get me a rental car, since I was not going to pay that much.  He said he would call me back.  That was a week ago.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"My ABS warning light was on so I called service and explained what was wrong.  They made me an appointment to have it diagnosed while I waited.  

When I arrived at the appointment I checked the car in and went to the waiting room.  Within a minute a service manager came out and yelled at me that this work could not be done while I wait and it would take the entire day. Apparently they were very backed up.  

I understand not being able to do the work in an hour or so.  Why wasn't I told this by phone?  Why did I have to waste my time going to the dealer to find this out?  Why can't Team Toyota service managers be at least a little bit polite and apologize for the misunderstanding?

I do not recommend Team Toyoya service."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I needed to get some recalls done on my car and Sunset Ford had an opening. Plus, I have a friend who lives near this location so they offered to drive me. Scheduling was a breeze. I filled out all the info online then they called me to see what day worked best. I wanted it ASAP but had to wait about a week unfortunately. That's what I get fro being so last minute...

I dropped my car off overnight and left my key and info in their sneaky little box. I had to get something else done beside the recalls and my total bill was only around $13. The 3 recalls were handled by the next afternoon with no problem! They even drove my car around to make me feel special. Way too fancy for me but I went with it. 

You ain't too shabby, Sunset Ford."

I Googled auto parts stores near me and called the closest one which was O'Riley's on Tanque Verde.  Matt answered and assured me if I went there they'd have a tool and he'd help me.  True to his word Matt was eager to assist, using tools from a tool box on their counter and didn't even charge me.  He could not have been nicer or more helpful and words cannot express my gratitude.  It was THE bright spot in my week.  You rock Matt, thank you very much!!  .

Because of the service I have received from him it makes me want to purchase Lexus only from here on out whether new or used as it makes dealing with any car maintenance or repairs a true pleasure.Phuong truly goes the extra distance over and above the call of duty. I feel because of this level of service he provides he adds significantly to Lexus profitability through relationship building that builds brand loyalty. I feel VERY fortunate to have found him!"

After committing on Hughes, they handled everything with my insurer,  State Farm, directly. They kept me updated on my vehicles progress through out and even gave me a 2017 Honda HRV to use as a loaner while my car was in the shop! I appreciate the staff's eagerness to help and their professionalism greatly. Hopefully I do not need an body work soon but when I do, I will return to Hughes without hesitation. I got my Mini Cooper back in pristine condition and I could not be happier :)"

This dealership focuses on gift card programs to lure you in but then you see that the gift card promotion is really a scam! The Internet manager tells me he has been offering this program for years. He has no idea how many potential buyers he has scared off!!
 Avoid this silly game and buy your Honda from a reputable Honda Dealer. Read the many complaints listed from frustrated buyers of Tampa Honda. This is NOT the dealership to buy your new Honda.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"An absolutely horrible business.  It took 48 minutes to have the car washed. Why? Waiting lives were backed up so attendants took cars arriving after me in my lane to move to an adjacent lane. They explained that "" the red truck in front of you is going to move soon. He's never dirty.""  Real reason was that they had three  interior cleaners in the adjacent lane and one in mine who felt it unimportant to hustle in the least. At the other end, car got driven out and sat 15 minutes in the sun before anyone dried it. They simply left it and took care of five or six other vehicles first. Terrible job. Quality has steadily declined  for years but this is a new low.  Manager replied to me that ""we have lots of customers to serve.""  Well not me."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"The Cherry Hill team is fantastic!  I blew out a tire on Rt 70 on my way to pick up my grandson from daycare in Philly.  I drove the mile+ up to Mr. Tire.  Even though they were quite busy, they took the time to check my tire to see if it could be fixed (I ran over a curb; I knew it was a goner).  Jim and Brian found a suitable tire and, without trying to sell me another one, got it on my car, balanced everything out and had me on my way in 50 minutes!  
In the past they did an emergency brake job for my daughter on a busy Saturday, finding discounts a rebates to lower the price.

If you need an easy buying experience come here. But don't trust these people to do what they say ever! I will do my very best to tell everyone I know how awful my experience was!

The next day I drove to work then after work my car won't start. I called around and was told by several shops that I most likely had a blown head gasket $$!!!$$$!!!
I called Amaru and the next he came looked at my car and said it was a cracked radiator.  He immediately sent me a quote for repair.  I thought the price was fair and very reasonable.  He ordered the part and stopped my home and fixed my car.

They called me to the front desk only to tell me they forgot to order the parts.  I asked when they could get them in... A month later - I'm still waiting. (Actually, took my business elsewhere).

Lior was pleasure to work with showed me both the 2019 and 2020 models so I could decide which I preferred. He offered me really good pricing on the 2019 model but I decided the slight changes made for 2020 model were more to my liking. Lior then worked out a fair deal for me along with his sales manager and I had my new vehicle. If you are in the market for a new Honda consider Sloane Honda. They had a great selection of both 2019 and 2020 models and I had great experiences working with Lior.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"The cashiers are pleasant & helpful. They have a small deli near the truckers entrance. 
Daily specials at their restaurant.  Although, they could stand to wipe the tables before they put the silverware & napkins down. Otherwise the dining room is small, but basically clean. 
Small well kept salad bar. Polite & playful waitresses today, especially with some of the regular guys. 
No WiFi, unless you pay for it in the building. 
Only room for 89 trucks, quite a bit of reserved parking, which may keep some of the trouble out of the lot, as they have security. 
The fuel islands were well maintained, clean & trash emptied regularly. They have a  worker who keeps the lot picked up & apparently does an excellent job of it. 
No slacking here I am glad to say. This was an alternative to the nasty mess in La VERGNE, TN."

Believe me when I say, when we first came to him my mom gave him the 10degree and he passed with flying colors!

I have been going to this place for a very, very, very long time and sending everyone I know to him as well! 

Vinny is very honest and he never charges for anything that doesn't need to be done on your car!  

Vinny is professional, timely, honest and his feedback is straight from the hip.  He will check your car and tell you how much it will cost BEFORE he does any work!

His son and wife are very friendly and personable as Vinny!

If you are a woman especially and tired of being taken advantage of...VINNY is the answer and you will not be disappointed!

Then after a few days I still haven't received a call from them to tell me to pick up the car, so I called, and they said they found too many problems with the vehicle and had to wholesale it.
My gut feeling is, they figured they could sell it for a better price, so they decided to cut the deal. But assuming they were telling the truth, they didn't do a good job in ensuring that their vehicles were in good shape before putting them on the market. They also didn't do a good job by not even apologizing to me for wasting my time, and by not calling me back as soon as they decided to cut the deal.

I ended up paying 60 plus dollars, for a 49.99 special. Second time there and I won't go back. I get better service at the dealer and get this, it's also cheaper. Hate to say it, but I won't go back.

I asked him if all the cars came with heated seats and he turned to my mother and called me a brat and continued to insult me throughout the time I was looking at cars. I am a nurse and could never even dream of treating a patient this way. Needless to say I did not purchase a BMW. I took my business to Lexus and bought an RX instead. To this day I refuse to ever purchase a BMW from this dealership. It is never okay to belittle your customers.

My VW Toureg has locking lug nuts which were striped by a previous place. I contacted that previous place to let them know that it was striped and needed to be removed before I could put my tire on. Those people were a huge hassle and completely unapologetic. More time and stress then needed. Finally I had to go to yet another place and pay to get it removed. Went back to get that tire put on by Discount Tire. They were more apologetic than those other guys and it wasn't their issue! They bought me new lug nuts just because they felt bad for the huge hassle I've been through! The other guys lost a long time customer and Discount Tire gained a loyal customer.

He explained if there was a bulletin that I would not have to pay.I got frustrated and hung up and looked it up myself, it's bulletin TSB A20- 022. The frustrating part this is a Honda dealership and they clearly should know about about their bulletins. I should not have to look it up to assist them.

The guys were very nice and professional. The waiting room was very clean and comfortable. I was in and out in less than an hour. 

I can't recommend them enough.The staff was very helpful and fast. They were very professional and knowledgeable about the work they did. I definitely recommend this shop.Absolutely love these guys.  I went in for a brake job on my truck.  They were friendly, helpful, and quick.  I will definitely be back.  Thank you so much for such a great job!  Thank you again guys!I went here to get a new car and I have been to a few other car dealerships"
Automotive,3.0,CG,They tell you they will call you back with a quote but they never did. I called them twice and left messages. The second time I called they said they didn't have the part yet. They told me they'd be in a couple days. I called them back and they said they had a 2 day rental car to pick me up. I made an appointment for the following week. I called them again to see if they could get the part. They told me they had no availability and they couldn't get the part until Monday. I called again and was told they had the part and it would be a few days. They didn't call me back. I called again on Monday and they said they could get it by Friday.
Automotive,5.0,CG,"The Auto Shop is your go to place for your car repairs. 

The guys here are knowledgeable and have the best prices in town. The work is done in a timely manner and with a smile. It's a great feeling to have found a mechanic that you can trust. I highly recommend this place for your car repairs.I had a very good experience at this dealership. They were very professional, courteous, and made sure my needs were met. I will be coming back to them again for all my future car needs.I'm not sure why I am giving them a negative review but I thought this place was pretty decent. But not only that but I had a bad experience with their customer service department. I've been here twice"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"The customer service and overall experience has been outstanding.  I will continue to use this dealership for all my automotive needs.  I am a very loyal customer and will continue to bring all my cars here.  It's a great feeling to have found a service center that you can trust.  Thank you so much!I had a terrible experience with the service department at this dealership. They didn't have the right parts to replace my windshield on my car and tried to sell me on a windshield that I didn't need, so I would have to pay for it. They just didn't have the right windshield in stock, so they didn't have the right tools. It took them 4 days to get the correct windshield, but I got the right windshield"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Being new to FL,  I have been to many dealerships in the Tampa area, and the staff here is top notch. I am a very loyal customer and have never felt ripped off by a dealership. 

Thank you, 

I love my new car. You guys rock.I had a great experience purchasing a car from here. They were very accommodating and accommodating. I was able to get the car I wanted and they even let me test drive it for me. They were very flexible about how long it would take. I highly recommend this dealership. I would buy a car here again.A good experience at this location.  They have a very friendly staff, and I was able to get a loaner car for my"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"I went there to get a quote and they gave me a quote. When I got there they gave me an estimate and said I needed a new tire, and I could take it to another place. When I got there, I was told it would be $300 to replace the tire. I was quoted $450 to replace the tire, and $150 to replace the other two tires. I was shocked, but I was told it would be $170. I declined, and walked out. I ended up having to pay $80 for the tire and $50 to put the spare on. I understand that the people who work at this place are kind of busy, but I am not sure why I would take my car to any other place."
Automotive,3.5,CG,I was looking for a specific vehicle and the salesman was very rude and unprofessional. He said he would get back to me. I went to get the car and the salesman was rude and unprofessional. I left and went to a different dealer. This was my first time buying a vehicle and I will NEVER go to the dealership again.I have never had such a pleasant experience at a car dealership. This was my first time there and I am so happy that I made the decision to buy a car from them. The sales team was very nice and helpful. I was able to buy a vehicle online and get a good price on the vehicle. I also found that the finance manager was very nice and helpful and was very helpful. I went in to
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This is the only place I will ever take my cars to be worked on. Great and honest are words that don't come close to how good Frank at Habana auto is. He's a great guy and he's there for you. His prices are cheap and he does quality work in a timely matter. He believes in the customer, not just trying to get your money and make a quick over priced buck!  I highly recommend this auto service for you and your friends. You won't regret it.  I'm a customer for life... Thank you for your service and most of all for being an actual honest and dependable mechanic! Those my friends are two words that don't mix. ""An honest mechanic!"" Who's more dishonest and more about making a buck ? A mechanic or plumber? I want an honest, great and competitive priced mechanic and Frank is that!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Tampa and Ocala Camping World have the WORST customer service ever. We visited Tampa a few weeks ago and left with a bad taste and hoped Ocala would be different. We were wrong!  The sales women had a 100 questions and a ""form"" to fill out before we even step foot into a RV. After letting them know that we were only interested in looking at RV's she pretty much told us to ""go look"" on our own. We were looking for a bunk house which are hard to find so the last thing we wanted to do was have to go inside everyone to find a bunkhouse. She actually threw her pen down due to us not wanting to sit in and office and fill out forms. We will not be returning to ANY Camping World to purchase or have the RV, that we will be purchasing, worked on."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"My VW started making a ticking noise so I took it by a auto repair chain who will remain nameless. It was time to replace the timing belt. After hearing their high price I left. I have had repair work done at Antioch Auto Center long ago and I was very pleased, but not sure if they worked on volkswagen. After doing my homework, I also found that they are associated with the BBB. Turns out, they would charge me $600.00 less, they guaranteed my part for 1 year and the labor for 6 months!  I took my car there on a Tuesday afternoon and was able to pick up the next afternoon. I've had the car back for a week now and it runs like a dream. The staff here is very nice and knowledgable and I do recommend them. I am very satisfied with the work they did!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"This is the worst dealer I have ever dealt with. Every time I go for service, they try to upsell. When I told them I only wanted the service called for in the manual, they did not do any of the routine checking of the car called for. Last time I was there, one of the service people downloaded rap music on my hard drive. I asked the service advisor to tell the service guys not to do that and she said, no one could have done that. I guess it got there on its own. The dealer sent coupons via e-mail, but the service advisor did not want to honor them. These people need to take a class in customer service. Yesterday was the last time I will go there. I will drive the half hour to get to a different dealer. Maybe the owner should go back to California."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Been using them for 5 years the service continues to degrade. They used to have many shuttles to pick you up from baggage claim. Now you have to call and wait. I am writing this review after I have been told 3 times a shuttle is on the way and am now standing here 20 min. The airport is. Or busy and have seen every shuttle company go past 3 times. Never again. 

Not to mention they are the most expensive

Thank you for your comment below but how exactly do you want me to provide you with that information on this website so that 20 million people don't have access to my information. Typically YOU provide YOUR contact so I can get in touch with you. Besides if you read my review it said I was literally standing there waiting while typing it. I don't need your automated robot response thanks."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I drove my car there looking for an estimate on a repair for a dent I caused while driving too close to the key pad at my storage unit. I caused a dent on the hinge area on the drivers side door which prohibited me from opening my car door! I now had to climb over the console and get in or out of the passenger door! Stopping to ask for an estimate I could only roll my window down and explain the situation. Immediately a very kind man hurried to his tools, wrapped one with a cloth and quickly fixed my door area. Done...no charge...I could open my door. The panel looked perfect. He could easily charged me for this work. He didn't. This company is a one of a kind. I highly recommended them. I will be back. One doesn't find people like this just anywhere. We are lucky."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Had a great experience with salesman Scott until we started pricing out the car we wanted. Suddenly it went from the advertised price to nearly 3x that. When we asked how that pricing made sense, we were met with ""it's just simple math!"" We knew it would be a little more than the advertised price due to a couple factors but the price we were given was completely unexpected. There was no wiggle room in the pricing whatsoever and both the salesperson and the manager let us walk out without a second glance. We then went over to FERMAN MAZDA in Brandon who worked with us to find a price we were comfortable with and they explained the sneaky hidden fees that made their prices so high. Really quite unimpressed with this dealership, would highly recommend the extra drive over to the Brandon Ferman Mazda if you want a fair deal."

I bought a car here a couple years ago. I was told that my car was certified. I had an appointment and I got a call from the sales person to confirm it was certified. I had no issues with the car, they had it ready and ready to go. The entire experience was very pleasant. I will be buying my next car from them.I've had great experiences with my Acura MDX.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"Would be careful dealing with this dealership, as they are not certified by the law. I just purchased a vehicle from them and I am very disappointed with the service department. They should be ashamed of themselves. 

I am currently on a car purchase with them and I would not recommend them to anyone. They are the most dishonest dealer I have ever dealt with. I am also asking for my credit card to be able to go to my bank because I have to pay for my loan. I am also looking for a new car, and I am not going to purchase from them. 

Do yourself a favor and do your research before you go. We were ready to buy a car, and we got a $5,000 down payment for"
Automotive,2.5,CG,This dealership is horrible. They are an absolute joke. We bought a car for a very reasonable price. We had an appointment to test drive a car and the car was not ready. We were told it would take about 45 minutes to get the car. We made an appointment online and was told it would take about an hour to complete. When we got there it was a complete mess. We were told that the car was not ready and that they didn't have a car in stock. We had to wait another hour before the car even came in. We ended up going to the dealership where we were told that the car had been sold and it would take an additional two hours. They were very rude and dismissive and we felt like they were just going to
Automotive,4.5,CG,"After two collisions in quick succession, I thought I'd take it back to my mechanic. 

I had the car towed to B&S Automotive, and was very impressed with the customer service and the quality of work. 

I brought my car back in for the second time to have my front struts adjusted, and the work was completed in a timely manner. 

I would definitely recommend B&S Automotive, and will be returning for future service.I recently purchased a new 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Mark & Richard at Jeep of Brandon.  Mark & Richard are knowledgeable, friendly, and provide a great deal.  We were in and out in less than two hours.  The entire process went smoothly, and"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Just ordered my Oracle LED Rock Lights directly from Oracle website. Took the whole day to install them on my Jeep. The RF remote didn't work right from the gecko (I tried replacing the battery). It was  all good for DAY 1, I was able to use the the Bluetooth option to play with the color switching (even though the app sucks). I was still happy. Sadly on DAY 2 the Bluetooth will not pair with the lights (i followed the troubleshooting guide). I reached out to Oracle about the issue. Now they want me to take everything apart and send them the kit for a repair/replacement. Are you f**king kidding me?!?!? Do you understand how much time it takes to wire all the lights to be hidden?!?!? Obviously the issue is the control box!!!! Why not just send me a new control box and I send this one back? SMH."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Certainly not a recommended place to go if you are looking for honesty and integrity from the staff. I recently looked at a used car on their lot and during negotiations the salesman told me that they could eliminate the $495 administration fee if I paid sticker price.AMVIC regulations say that no additional charge other than gst can be added to the advertised price. I called him on it and he admitted it was a cash grab but he is just an employee.

I asked him if they were not willing to drop the sticker price if he could include a discounted set of winter tires. He quoted me a price that was more than I would pay if I walked in off the street! 

Needless to say, I decided to take my business elsewhere and I would encourage you to do the same. Dishonesty is not something I want to pay for!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,Worst experience with a shop I have ever had. Incompetent management and staff. Their arrogance is only rivaled by their ignorance. Some of the things they said were so far off from true it was shocking and if you question it or point out any of the facts that are lost on them they get extremely defensive and the service you receive gets even worse. $105/hr and they charge you dealer book labor times so you end up paying for twice as much time as it would take a competent mechanic to do the job. They had my car for a week for minor work and they just threw the parts in and everything had to be redone. The manager completely stops replying to emails after they have your money. This place is used to rich idiots with weekend porsches that will bend over without even questioning their BS and it shows.
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I decided to go to A & W because a previous review stated that they never rip off people who know nothing about cars, which turned out to be right!

I got a flat because of Pennsylvania's inability to fill potholes ever. Went in early on a Tuesday and Andrew, a super nice guy, called around to find me the cheapest replacement - took a total of 15 minutes, max. Came back the next day to have it put on the car, which he took care of while I was standing there in five minutes! It was the easiest experience I've ever had in an auto shop. Considering that the last time I got a flat I went to Walmart Tire & Lube and waited three hours to pay more than I paid at A & W, I know where I'll be going the inevitable next time Pennsylvania destroys my car."
Automotive,4.0,CG,About 2 months ago my car broke down on the highway.  I called my insurance company and they said that they had a tow truck available and they would be there within a couple of hours.  When I arrived they were very nice and professional.  I dropped my car off at the airport and they called me within the hour and said they would call me by the end of the day.  When I arrived I was told it would be about an hour and a half.  I was told that they had a lot of cars in front of me and it would take a few hours.  The man behind the counter said they were closing at 6:30 and he would call me by the end of the day.  I waited for about 20 minutes.
Automotive,2.5,CG,So today I had a flat tire and needed to get it repaired. I called the shop and they said that they had a lot of guys and they would be there in a couple of hours. They had me in and out in a half hour. I was very impressed. The staff was very nice and professional. I will definitely be going back to them again.I've had great experiences with my Acura MDX.  I recently had my car towed to the dealership for service and it was done quickly and efficiently.  The staff were very professional and courteous.  I highly recommend this dealership.A good experience at this location.  They have a very good selection of tires and are reasonably priced.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.
Automotive,4.0,CG,"We bought a CX-9 here last week and the experience was good. 

The first couple of months we had the car serviced at the dealership, we bought a CX-9. They had it for a few days, and it was ready when we picked it up. 

The only issue was the oil change. 

They did a complete check-up for us, and when we picked it up, they told us it was good to go. They even washed the inside of the car, but didn't clean the inside of the car.

Overall, it was a great experience. They didn't try to pressure us into buying anything we didn't need, and they got us in and out in about"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"ARM have great personal skills. 

I'd give them a zero if I could. 

I am very disappointed. 

I have a credit score of 4.5%. I had no issues with the financing, they had my paperwork ready to go. The financing was great. 

The finance manager, Andre, was very nice. He was also extremely helpful and very professional. 

This is the only dealership I have ever visited in the area that I have worked with in the past. I will definitely be back for my next vehicle.

Thank you, Andre!A good experience at this location.  They have a very friendly staff, and I was able to get a loaner car for my family."
Automotive,4.5,CG,"While waiting to get the car back, the mechanic decided to jump start my car and move the car.  I had to jump start it and then the car died.  I took it to a local mechanic and they fixed it for $500.  This is a very honest mechanic.  They are honest and I will be back.  I will definitely bring my car back here.  I will recommend them to anyone I know!I recently purchased a brand new Tacoma from Chapman Ford.  I was very pleased with the service I received from Mike and his team.  Mike was very helpful, and provided excellent customer service.  I would definitely recommend Chapman Ford to anyone looking for a vehicle.I'm new to the area and went in to look at"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"This is one of the few outposts of business integrity left these days. They consistently deliver an excellent service, and do so with great efficiency. Watching a cleaning team work on the car is like watching a Formula One pit crew--they continually inspect, revise and rework the job to get it right. If anything is overlooked, they fix it fast without question. I have been going here for many years, and only recently had an issue with a damaged antenna. (I have never heard of anybody having a similar issue with Sunshine). After reviewing their tapes, they agreed that the antenna was OK on the way in and not so on the way out. They replaced my antenna (very pricey satellite model) without question. I drive from north Palm Harbor to use this business. I cannot overstate what a great local business this is, and how well you will be treated here--every time."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Being a diehard Honda owner, I only believe in giving my girl the best!! That being said I took my 06' Honda Odyssey Touring to Indy Honda for fuel service diagnistic costing $150. There is a waiting room filled with snacks and refreshments.  Indy Honda came back with I had to pay $5K+ to replace my engine (had less than 100K miles) with a used one, yet my van had just been driven to Texas! The service dept was very nasty to me and when asked claimed the general manager or service supervisor's name could not be furnished. Needless to say, out $150, I towed my van to Ed Martin Honda at my expense and the engine was tested and fine. I replaced the fuel pump and it drives like a charm now!  Just had a lovey California road trip with no issues! I definitely won't be back to Indy Honda!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This was my first time going here.  I was way past due for an oil change and had been unable to make an appointment due to a busy work schedule.  When I finally had a small block of time,  I went here.  No appointment required.  The service was very fast and professional.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes.  They even vacuumed my car, which is always a treat.  I appreciate their speed and service.  My reservation was the cost.  My car isn't anything fancy or high performance.  They only offer synthetic oil, which bumps the price of the oil change up significantly.  I ended up paying more then I usually would as a result.  They were great in a pinch and the service was excellent.  I'll have to weigh that against the cost in the future."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Brought my car in today for a misfiring engine on a high-mileage Mitsubishi. The people there treated my car great. Worked with Alfredo, who called me every step of the way to a perfect repair. Most importantly, he didn't talk to me like I was an idiot - respected that I knew what he was saying to me, and listened to what I thought about the car. Just exceptionally professional and smart. 

Alfredo even saved me about $100 by calling around to get a better price on ignition coils. Also, he thought it was going to take 4-5 days, but he managed to find a way to get it done today. Brought the car in at 10:30 am, had it back at 6:00. 

The technicians on my car were Rafaelito and Eliece. Props to them, too. My car drives better than the day I bought it. I'd recommend this Tires Plus to anybody."
Automotive,5.0,OR,My sunroof was not working properly and I called about a week ago the first time and Mark was sent out to help me. He was very professional and even though it took quite a while for the problem to get fixed he was never rude or impolite. I had to call them again today to put in a part I forgot to ask them to fix the first time Mark came and thats when my one and only issue came about. Which is that Summit Auto Glass does not call when a driver is on their way like they said they would and the time period they said a driver would be at my house was wrong. He was 30mins earlier then I expected so I was not home and felt bad for making him wait but was not told he would be there early. Overall my experience was very good though.
Automotive,4.0,CG,"I called Central Auto Service and asked if they could help me out. They said yes and said they would be there in a few hours. 

I showed up at 4:30 and was told they couldn't help me out. I told them I was still waiting and that I had a 2pm appointment. I told them I had to wait and I was so upset. They offered to take my car to a different mechanic to diagnose my issue and fix it. I'm not sure if I'll be back, but I will be bringing my car to a place I trust to get my car serviced.I have used this parking garage twice.  The first time I was in the area, I was given a ""top off"" of the list price"

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Unfortunately this AM our Audi A6 had an ECU warning light displayed.  I attempted my best to get her driving down the road however I had to abandon ship, the dash advised to not go over 1500 RPMs.  Investigation revealed from the wifey, she had been racing some Honda car club on the I580...at least she won!!!  Got in touch with A&A towing over the phone.  I voiced my concern about my wifeys supercharged baby and a low front bumper.  A&A sent Marty to help me. Marty called just before he arrived and told me he's the guy who handles the exotic pickups.  Don't get confused this Audi A6 is no Lambo but it's still legit.  

Marty went above and beyond, using caution to get the A6 up on the flatbed without dragging it or messing up that glacier metallic paint.

A&A Towing thanks again for sending Marty."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"DON'T GOT HERE!!  I have never written a negative review about anything on line but I feel this needs to be done to warn people about this business.  I brought my car in for an oil change,  the next day it was leaking power steering fluid all over my garage.  I went back and they were so rude and insinuated I was ""stupid"" if I thought they did anything wrong!  The owner would not talk to me and the worker told me to ""get a lawyer"".  The rudeness and lack of service was way out of line.  This has happened to 3 other friends of mine over the years but I wanted to give them another chance only to be very disappointed.  My regular mechanic said he has heard many stories about this place so I felt I needed to go on here to warn others."

We were looking for a vehicle today, and were referred to a very lethargic and unengaged sales representative. When we informed management, they mentioned that he was one of their best sales person....WOW!! What an awful representation of a dealership, and lack of leadership in this place. We were just handed the keys, and the salesperson pointed where the car was parked. Did not walk us over, or discuss more about our needs, what bought us in, or a simple conversation! No interaction, lack of enthusiasm, and respect for customers. I can see why this place has low stars...New management is certainly needed, and much better training for employees. If I can give zero stars, I'd do so. Horrible and totally unprofessional! Inexcusable when customers matter to run a business!"

I called Mr Car Wash, and asked what their rain policy was.....and was told they do not have ANY.    Typically a car wash will re do the wash within 24 hours....but NOPE.  I would NEVER expect a full car wash like I got today, but after paying 25 dollars....hearing they offer nothing?

I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used car.I brought my car in for a simple oil change and I was told it would take 1.5 hours. I got my car back"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"My wife and I have a 1.5 year old and a newborn so coming out to the dealership just wasn't in the cards for us, especially in the middle of a pandemic spike with omicron. I worked closely with Cynthia who was always responsive, whether by phone, text, or email and never beat around the bush with pricing.

She was able to get all of our paperwork done remotely and delivery arranged in less than 24 hours. I was in touch with multiple other dealerships with ridiculous markups, add-ons, and more than anything, a lack of transparency with their pricing and lease pricing breakdowns. This place was the total opposite and a breath of fresh air!

If you're looking for an Acura, even all the way from LA like us, this is the place to go to. Thank you Cynthia and Acura of Santa Barbara -- we look forward to working again with you in the future!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"They were very professional and friendly. The guy helping me looked at my Michelin tires, which I knew were about worn out. He also asked me if I liked my old tires. When I commented about road noise and how loud they were, he said that he could sell me a different type of Michelin tire for right around what I had paid for my old ones, and he promised that they would be quieter. He was right. I couldn't believe how nice it is being able to talk to a passenger or on the cell without having to yell over the tire noise. It's like being in my living room now, except without the 42"" flat screen. I was in and out in a hurry. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that when I took my car in later to get tires rotated, it seemed to take longer than expected."
Automotive,3.0,OR,Had to take my car here due to a nail in the tread. Was seen right away when I walked in around 8:15am. The person at the front desk (Kevin) was very pleasant. When I originally called they charged me a different price and he adjusted it down because it just was a tire repair. I waited a total of about an hour which I already knew would probably happen. Not bad of a wait time. After my car was taken off the lift he told me they were testing pressure throughout the tire to make sure the job was done correctly and clear the sensors. Communication was great. Total price to repair my tire and remount it on my car was 18 so not bad for service. When I called firestone  they said the earliest I could be seen was at 2pm kinda of ridiculous. Will be coming here again for my tires.
Automotive,2.0,OR,"6/1/16 I brought my car to get an oil change, Mantua, NJ  and had a coupon for 29.99 for the Synthetic oil blend. So after over an hour of waiting, I go to pay my bill and it's 40.52!! I told H. Chapman that I had a coupon for 29.99??? She just said oh we added some charges for disposal of oil filter and tax. So I get home and see that they charged me 14.99 for an OIL FILTER! The coupon DID NOT SAY THAT IT WAS NOT INCLUDED. Rip off the customer and then lie about it. I have never paid extra for an oil filter!

Automotive,2.0,OR,"When it is open, it is usually a decent quick car wash. I actually used to drive out of my way to get a car wash. However, I've stopped by five times now in the last 3 months and it has been ""temporarily closed"" for three of those trips. I understand that they went through some renovations recently which explains why they were closed a couple of those times. I stopped by after the renovation and got a car wash and was pleased (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1). However, the last two times I've made the drive they have been closed post renovation. They don't have a website to update customers whether or not they are open -- which is something I recommend to management if they even read these reviews. 

Unfortunately, I most likely won't be returning to this business and will he finding another car wash to frequent."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Despite great claims, customer service, and professional workmanship. I will definitely be using this shop for all my automotive needs. The people there are also very knowledgeable and honest. They do not try to sell you everything you need. I will most certainly be going back to them.Great service!  They found the problem within the hour and fixed it in a timely manner.  I highly recommend them.This is the worst car dealership I have ever dealt with. We are very loyal customers and we have never felt pressured to buy anything. 

I'm not a fan of the other dealerships we visited but I would give them a one star if I could. 

I had my car detailed and was given a ""top off"" of the list price."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"I knew as soon as I walked in the door that I was going to have to wait for the appointment. I had to ask a few questions and the man who answered the phone was very helpful. I told him I would be back for the car. I got there and they took the car and said it was ready to go. I had to wait on the shuttle so I could get home. When I came back to pick up the car, I was told that I had to wait for the car to be pulled up. I was really disappointed with the service I received from them. I will not be returning. I have used this parking service twice. The first time I was in the area and the second time was to get my front brakes replaced."

However, the finance department was quite a mess. I was told by the manager that I would have to go through the warranty to get the vehicle repaired. I had a loaner vehicle for the day and was told that it would be a few weeks before the warranty was in place. They could not tell me how long it would be and told me I would have to go through the warranty."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Made an appointment 4 days in advance and they had me in and out in a couple hours. The owner, Kevin, was very friendly and took the time to explain the problem and explain what it was and why it was taking so long. He even told me to drop off my car with him. I will be coming back here for all my car needs! Thanks for everything!I will never use this location again. I used to go to a different location and when I got home I noticed that the prices for oil change were higher than I was expecting.

I have purchased many cars and I can't say enough good things about this dealership.  I would buy another car from them if I could.  Thanks again, very happy.I've been here twice for service and they have been really nice and helpful. I had a flat tire and needed it fixed quickly.

They were able to get me in right away and get me back on the road within a few hours. I had a tire emergency and I was able to get me in right away. I was really impressed. I was in and out in under an hour and they even let me drive off in my car.  I couldn't be happier with the service I received. They also got me in and out in less than an hour.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I went in for an oil change based on the sign $23.99 but I paid $42.98. Upon entering the establishment, I was waved to go to an area and a man handed me a blank slip to complete name/signature. I didn't think anything about it and walked inside to wait for my car. 

When it came time to pay the bill, I was shocked to see $42.98 for what because I only wanted a simply oil change. I explained to the woman, Denise, who basically kept repeating my name and ignoring my inquiry. If a customer needs additional items it's customary to let them know instead of doing it and charging them later. So,I'm not happy with that aspect of the company and will be mindful if I ever go back to have them do an oil change again. If extra services are needed, inform customers before charging them. I think that's underhand and shaded business!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I want to say this. I have had many complications here, lack of thorough communication. Customer service horrible. Car not being fixed correctly. Outrageous pricing. Horrible. I went in again after my car not being properly fixed. The 1st time. Only because the area manager . Travis Goddard resolved all immediately. He is a respectful, highly educated in his field, and an excellent listener. Getting to the bottom line of anything. I highly recommend this location. I've had amazing service here. 
But, check this out went in again. Had complete vehicle check. I was told totally different problems with 2 service men. I actually called a auto shop that's been around 67 years. Inspection, was given at 1/2 price even using Mercedes parts. What I was told at Tires Plus totally wrong. So let's see, 3500 and I'm paying 1300 with a service B added on. Excellent customer service, where would you go. Obviously not here."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I bought my car from this dealership.  So I have gone back for maintenace, for the last two years.  Their service used to be so much better.  Usually when you pull your car in the service lane, they would have people come to greet you and ask you what service your car needs.  The last couple of times I have gone there I was confused, I stood by my car and waited for some to come by and no one.  I proceeded to the service entrace door and still don't know who to talk to to get service.  I finally approached someone with a name tag and he helped me, 30 mins later, another person said my car was ready.  Again, I didn't know where my car was parked, who has the key, where to pay for the service, etc.  Sigh next time I will try Jiffy Lube."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had my boat delivered to Boat and Motor Superstors to help fix an issue with my twin yamaha 250s. I bought the Boat earlier this year and it turn out the long blocks needed repair on both engines. I Have an extended warranty for both motors that expires in October and let them know all the information on the certificates. I was informed repairs (not new long blocks) would be over $12,000 or I would have to get new engines. They also told me that the extended warranty would not apply to me and cannot be transferred. 
I found another place that deals with Yamahas and the engines WERE under warranty and I received two new long blocks, not just a quick repair. 
I am still fuming about this and feel being a female I was completely almost taken advantage of. 
Thankfully I found an honest shop and have my boat back running like new."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I was very impressed with how much work each of the workers put into making my car look brand-new!  My vehicle is admittedly very poorly kept inside due to my desire to take my dog everywhere I go inside it!  They got more of the fur out than I have ever been able to manage, and for the first time the interior of my windows are devoid of nose prints!  My car battery died in the midst of their hard work, but they were able to jump it, & when I thought they were already done, they stated that they still had more cleaning to do!

I will definitely be coming back...& look forward to utilizing their shampooing service of my seats & floors.  Such a value for a ""basic"" car wash...I look forward to what their ""detailing"" service provides!  

Thank you to the hard working staff at Buggy Bath Car Wash!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I live in Ohio and my wife and I were searching for cars everywhere in the US. Not entirely thrilled or comfortable buying a vehicle online sight unseen. However, we found the perfect vehicle that she was looking for from the trim level to the price, mileage, and color. So we decided to pull the trigger. From the very first phone call with D'vyne, to the quick turn around with Nick, the follow up and finance call with Will and the delivery from Tom. The entire process was seamless and comfortable! It doesn't  end there, it has been a little over 2 weeks since they went out of their way to deliver the vehicle to our driveway. In those 2 weeks I have received follow up calls from every single one of them, just to check in and answer any questions we might have. This dealership and its staff turned a skeptic into a believer."

They said they would call me when it was ready.  I called and was told by a woman that they hadn't gotten to it yet.  They called me back and said it was ready.  When I got there they were on my way and started to look at the car.  I explained my situation and they said they couldn't fix it.  They just said that it was covered under warranty.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"I am going to write a review based on one interaction with one attendant. 
I was on business near the Philadelphia Public Library on Vine Street.
As I was parking the guy comes up to me and tells me to make sure I pay for the meter. He was being very nice and insuring I did not misunderstand the signage. 
I've parked in the area many times, so I kind of knew what I was doing. But, I just felt it was a nice gesture. He did not want me to get a ticket. 
He even said people get confused a lot in this location. 

For all the grief this group gets, I figured I'd write out a nice one. 
Yes, I get tickets to and when I do it is because I deserved it. I did not update a meter or read a sign properly. 
They do there job and do it well, no complaints from me."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Not sure what the other ""bad"" reviews are talking about!  I stopped in to tire shop and Shawn was VERY helpful from the second I met him.  Quoted me a price and then said he could get the tires in the next day.  I took the next day to shop around the internet and even checked ""the Boys"" up the road and ""the Boys"" were a lot more expensive for the same tires.  Called Shawn the next day around 11am and ordered the tires....he had them in store by 3pm and I arrived at 5pm to have them installed and was out the door by 5:45pm.  I have to say I was impressed and very pleased they could get this done so quickly.  Shawn and his team were great and I will definitely return.  Thanks for a great experience at CJ's!

Pre wash station was nice, the attendant offered to clean my tires for me.  they have 4 options: $5 standard wash, $8 wash plus tire clean, $12 double wash and tire clean, and $15....double wash, tire clean...and something else. I went for the $8. I never wash my car (so perhaps take my review with a grain of salt). My car looks brand new, my tires and rims look brand new.  I had very little to wipe dry on my car...and that was just because I brought a towel and felt I should use it.  The vacuums are on both sides and have pretty decent sucking power. I was ok with the plastic cutlery, pens, change and bobby pins it sucked up. Great quick experience, will likely go back there every time."

The truck shined like it was new (it's a 2015 model) and was cleaned thoroughly inside and out.  All of this for a price that beats their competition by a mile.

THEY SAID THE TRUCK NEEDED A NEW INTAKE AND THERE IS NOT ONE LEAK ON IT.  The issue was a simple vacuum leak which any decent mechanic should have known within 5 minutes.  They also charge $100 an hour for labor which is totally absurd unless you are a dealership. They tried to take me on a runaround.  They are dishonest, sleazy mechanics.  Also, they promised to diagnose issues needed for inspection in a day.  It took them five for one hour diagnostics.  Run, run far away!  I would rate zero stars if possible."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Dear Readers
Euromax has the most hopeless service in the whole of New Jersey. There is no doubt about the fact that you get what you pay for, no body does a whole car detailing for $39.
Most of the time they don't answer your calls.
I had a voucher for car detailing and they messed up two schedules, with the latest on 21 Dec 2017, they never informed about the gas issues they had, I travelled all the way from Philadelphia to be told that they again are unable to do the job. They are not courteous in their action or deed, though they are quick to say sorry.
Please don't waste your precious time with euromax junk. 
I had a bitter experience and I think they are writing their own reviews.
I called Groupon and explained everything and they were ready for a refund. 
Let's see if they give a refund.
Thanks guys for taking your valuable time to read this.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"This is probably the best car wash in all of Santa Barbara proper. 

I come here because I know I will get a good wash, at a price I can handle. Love that it's a hand wash-style, and how you pay upfront. Nice and simple. 

The staff is friendly, and I can tell that they truly care. They typically spend a little extra time, making sure that no spot is untouched. From the outside to the inside, my vehicle always turns out spotless and impressive. 

My previous vehicle had a full body vinyl wrap, and this was the only place in town I trusted to wash it. Their technique is gentle and careful, and it honestly doesn't feel like they are just rushing the customer in and out. 

Come here if you are looking to treat your baby to a wash that's a step above the rest of the game, but without the exorbitant price tag you'd expect."

Automotive,3.5,OR,"I drive past 3 other Chevrolet dealerships to get my service work done at Penske.
Why?

Best service advisors.  These folks are very professional and obviously understand their jobs.  Very knowledgeable.  Very respectful.  If they say you need to fix something (in a no pressure way), you'd best believe in their advice.
Gary Debolt, my advisor, is one of the best.

Best Technicians.  All highly trained.  Quick, too.  These folks are hopping, keeping your service stay to a minimum.  Oh, and they offer a complimentary car wash; even with something as simple as an oil change.  Ask any other Chevy dealer in town if they do also.  Nope.

Best waiting environment.  The waiting room is first class.  Free WiFi (yes, their's works) Free snacks.  Plenty of space to lounge in a completely clean multi-media environment.

Hey folks, they (Chevy Dealers) all charge the same.
Penske provides a first class experience, no others match."
Automotive,3.0,OR,Recently called this dealership because I needed an oil change and had a very rude confrontation on the phone after being on hold for almost 30 minutes. Once I got through I asked the service worker what time I could bring my Jeep in and I was told appointments were 3 weeks out or I could bring it in before 10 any day. As soon as the service worker gave me that info he hung up the phone before I could even ask a question. After this I still gave it a chance and arrived at 9:15 today and the service manager told me that they only accept walk ins from 7-9 after being told 10 the day before. The service manager nick was not very helpful and made it seem like it was my fault that their dealership gave me incorrect info. Overall a very poor experience and I will not be returning to this dealership ever again.

This is where the amazing part comes in. When the work was done, I paid exactly what the estimate was. No extra fees, no BS additional services. Just fast, friendly, and honest repairs.

Do make sure that you get there early on Saturdays, as it is first-come, first-serve and there are no appointments.

Another very important note is that this is not really at 2401 Vare Ave. It is at the corner of S. 24th and West Oregon Ave. Just match it up to the listing on Meineke's real web site and you can get decent directions. Google maps takes you to the wrong place!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"These great folks have just moved into these new digs! Although it's a little unusual, these folks are really two businesses in one location.  The gas operation is separate from the service station.  Over time the gas side has changed hands but these excellent mechanics have REMAINED THE SAME GREAT PEOPLE SINCE 1973!

If you are like most folks, there is always some unpleasant pressure when you bring your car to a service station.  How much is it going to cost? Will I get it back on time? Will I be pressured to buy unnecessary stuff?  

There is a reason why I've been using these folks for 18 years!  My car is always ready ON TIME.  Of course I'm going to pay $$ but I always feel the price is FAIR. I'm never pressured to purchase UNNECESSARY SERVICES. 

If you live in or around the Havertown area, it doesn't get much better than this!"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"I used the Yelp app and it was an easy experience.

The actual car was pretty good.  The salesmen are a bit shady but the car was pretty great.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was going to take a while to get the vehicle.  I ended up going with it because the car was on the lot so I didn't have to wait long to get it.

I called the next day to make an appointment and they said they would be there the next day.  I arrived and was told the car was still on the lot and would be ready by the end of the day.  I was there for less than an hour and was told I could come back the following day to see if I could get a loaner"
Automotive,3.0,CG,Worst place ever my mom and I have ever had an issue with our vehicle. I went there to get an oil change and the guy at the counter said we're not allowed to go to the car wash and we will be driving around for about 15 minutes and see if we can get the oil change. So we came back and they said they don't have the oil they're supposed to sell us. We paid for the oil change and they didn't have the oil in stock. We walked out of there and left. The manager was really nice and apologetic. They just didn't seem to care and just wanted to get the sale. We left. I don't know how they stay in business.I was in the market for a new vehicle and was looking for a new vehicle.
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Lousy customer service from Mike and his staff. I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation and had a coupon for a free tire rotation. After a few days of waiting, I received a call saying I needed a new tire. I declined the service and paid for a new tire. I picked up the car and the mechanic told me that I needed a new tire and had to pay $50 for the tire rotation. I declined the service. I paid for the tire rotation and they rotated the tires, which I did not need. When I went to pick up my car, they didn't rotate the tires. I had to pay $80 for this service. The manager told me he would call me back."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

The one star is because the service department is a joke. They are rude and unprofessional. I had a bad experience with the dealership, and the first place I went was to Honda. 

The next day, I went in with an issue with my car. They gave me a very quick and thorough diagnosis, and told me it would be $250 to replace a part that had to be replaced. I asked if they could replace that part, and they said yes. I showed them the part, and they said they could not. I was just in a rush to get there, and I asked if they could do it. They said yes. They were very polite, and told me I could get it done in"

I was told it would take about an hour and a half. I came back two hours later to find out that the car had been sitting on the lift for over an hour. I was told it would take about an hour to complete the job. I got home and went back to wait. I was told that I would have to wait another hour for an oil change and tire rotation. I had an appointment"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"My husband and I take both of our vehicles here. They are friendly, knowledgeable, and the prices are extremely reasonable. The people there are also very knowledgeable and honest. They do not try to sell you everything you need. I would highly recommend them. I will be back for my next vehicle. I had a great experience purchasing a car from here and it was a smooth transaction. They did not pressure me into anything I didn't need. The sales people were very helpful and very helpful. I would highly recommend buying a car from here. I'm not sure why I am giving them a negative review but I'm definitely not going to post it because of my experience. I had a bad experience with this dealership and I was going to go back to the dealership to buy a new vehicle."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"As a frequent traveler, I've been subjected to most all of the St. Louis airport parking facilities.

Parking Spot 2 is by far the best, and easily my favorite location. (This endorsement is ONLY for Parking Spot ""2""...not 1 or 3)

Parking Spot 2 is my fave for basically two significant reasons:
1. The pickup point is MT18 at the main terminal. That's at the far west side of the terminal, where hotel shuttles pick you up. This is MUCH better then having to walk out to the center sidewalk to meet the shuttle on your return trip...especially during bad weather.
2. The shuttle will take you directly to your car on your return, as long as you've either a) remember the spot you're in, or b) still have the card they give you when they pick you up on the day you left.

Parking lots in general are an expensive pain of travel. But PS2 is by far the least painful option I've used.

Automotive,1.5,OR,"I wouldn't call the update to the website an ""upgrade"" whatsoever. It's ridiculous and beyond frustrating. I've never in my life had so much trouble trying to log on to a site to make a payment. I can't even get anywhere resetting my password. EVERYTHING is ""invalid"". I can't click on ""forgot my username"" to try that route because it doesn't exist. It's also pretty inconvenient for all of us who aren't on PST that customer service isn't available until after our workday has begun - and we're not able to deal with this until the evening, or if we're lucky, on a lunch break (because everyone loves to be stuck on a 30 min wait for customer service calls during their lunch). Considering you're a branch of Evergreen, which is in the central time zone in IL, there should probably be some customer service reps to get started with the rest of us at a decent time of morning."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This is absolutely one of the must see tourist attractions in New Orleans. I must admit that I knew almost nothing about Mardis Gras aside from beads and celebration, but upon completing the 30 minute tour within a warehouse/construction site, my mind was blown away by the intricate detail and years of work that went behind each amazing float.

Of note, this is more than just a storage facility visit, this is a guided tour. You first start with a 10 minute video followed by a very tasty treat. Then you will explore both the floats-in-progress, as well as the finished products. There were so many amazing opportunities for photographs, to marvel and to learn about the crazy process. This was an absolute blast and worth every penny.

I do recommend taking an uber here, as the rails will only take you within a 20 minute walking distance where you have to traverse through non-ideal walking areas to get to this place."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Getting an oil change during COVID is a very unique experience. I called to see if I needed an appointment and they told me it was first come first serve. Lucky for me I arrived at 3:30pm on a Friday and they were able to get me right in. I was instructed to stay in my car and 5 men swarmed by vehicle to get to work. If I didn't know what was going on, this would be the stuff nightmares are made of - single lady in car and 5 men all dressed in black with masks come racing up to the car and start shaking it and tapping at the windows. Really it was a fun treat however to watch them get down to business. The oil change, fluid check, window washing service took all of ten minutes and i was in and out in a flash. Thanks, Jiffy lube first the quick and interesting oil change experience."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Stopped in for windshield wiper blades (one of mine broke in the bitter cold and snow). The supervisor saw me puzzling over how to figure out what I needed and asked if I needed help. I told her I was having a hard time with the process and she invited me to the parts counter where she looked up what I needed, then explained what the various choices were (inexpensive to very expensive). After we selected the appropriate equipment she told me they would install them for free. Great! The person who installed them was cheerful despite the single digit temperatures and when parts were missing ran right in and got replacement parts. Overall a magnificent experience. I can't use their service department because I have an unusual vehicle that often requires proprietary tools that only the dealer has but love having them as a resource for the more common items. I also like that they are a Philadelphia company."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Purchased some Aries action trac steps for my Ford pick up for 2k and had multiple issues with them within the year or so since . One either quits retracting into the actual step or gets stuck, this is the 2nd time this has happened and supposed to be under warranty! Months and months have gone where I had to call for an update  as to where the hell these pieces of craps are ? When I first took the truck in Alex said they'd be replaced no problem but they're in North Dakota or some crap and COVID will delay shipping , I bought it and left it is now June 11th and this was in February so are they making these new ones from scratch? Shitty communication and no call backs, between me and my old man we've spent quite a bit of money at this place but the hell with them now thanks ""quality bumper"" !"
Automotive,3.5,CG,Best value for airport parking.  The attendants are friendly and professional.  The car rental experience is a great one.  I will use this company again.I had a very good experience with this shop.  I dropped my car off around 9:30am to get an oil change and a tire rotation.  I picked up my car at 3:30pm and was told it would be ready by 5:00pm.  The manager told me that the car would be ready by 6:00pm.  I arrived at 4:00pm.  They had my car ready by 5:00pm.

Automotive,4.5,CG,"Avenue Scooters is new, but it has been a long time since it was my first rodeo and I've never had a bad experience.  

I've had a lot of bad experiences here and I've had good experiences here.  I've had to wait two weeks for a simple oil change and they've even gotten to know me about the process.  

Also, when I had to leave my car there for two days, I had to call for updates on the status of my car.  The service was quick, professional and pleasant.  I was very pleased with their service.  I'd recommend this place to anyone.This is my second time using this service center and both times I have been happy with the service and the service I've received."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had a great experience here! It was my first time purchasing a car on my own, but they made it very easy and non-complicated. Everyone I spoke with was friendly, and not once did I feel pressured or scammed.  You don't negotiate car prices here- the price tag on the car window is exactly what they sell it for. I personally liked that I didn't have to haggle or nitpick over numbers.  

The car I purchased ended up needing a new battery, but they changed it before I left the lot, and they asked to keep the car over the weekend so they could double check that everything else was working. I got a free rental car during that time, as well. They seemed to genuinely care that I left with the car that was best for me, and that I'd be safe in. The associate I worked with was named Rondel and he was awesome! Highly recommend."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My daughter and I found a car we were interested in purchasing late Saturday at the used care lot with Thoroughbread Nissan.  Due to the lateness and a Sat, we were told they could not complete the financing and they would call Monday. We called them multiple times Monday before hearing back from them. Again, they made an excuse, the banks were closed due to Columbus day.  We understood this and asked if they would call back Tuesday. We called them Tuesday, and they informed us they had the car we wanted out with someone borrowing it for the day who was interested in buying it because he put money down. This option was never offered to us. These crooks broke my daughter's heart. She really wanted the car, I had a pre-approval from a loan company, but they were sure they could get a better rate. In actuality they screwed us out of a car my daughter loved"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"My experience was great from start to finish - Jonathan answered my questions and gave me an accurate quote that came in at about 40% less than Safelite for a new front windshield. So then I asked about also doing the rear glass which had been damaged by a previous owner's tint job - replacing the rear glass was estimated at around 60% less than what I'd been quoted at Safelite! This might be due to having a very common model Toyota; however, I was impressed with the estimate. I dropped my car off at lunch and picked it up after work at 5pm. The work was done perfectly and cleanly. I noticed that the volume of business was high - they had a lot of vehicles be serviced and still managed to get me in without an appointment. Given the high volume, I can understand how they might get some negative reviews, but my experience was exceptionally good."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I recently purchased a brand new 2015 Volkswagen Beetle ('recently' as in not even a week ago) and the service that I received was spectacular. I worked with John, who is a hilarious little Italian man and he really knows what he's doing. My expectations were rather low when I first stepped foot on to the lot; there weren't as many Beetles as I thought there would be and most of the used beetles were manual so that didn't work in my favor, BUT when my dad and I decided to take a gander at the new Beetles, my hopes were beginning to raise. Now I will add in that I was being swayed in to buying a different Beetle (wasn't in to the silver nor the interior), but hey, what do you expect from a salesman? Overall, my experience was great and I am very satisfied with my new car. I would recommend my family and friends to this dealership."

It was a very busy day and I was nervous to wait. The staff was very nice. I was also impressed with the level of service and customer care. I definitely will be back. This place is awesome. I went in for a brake job, and they were able to do it quickly and efficiently. They were very nice and professional. They even had a great coffee bar and a few other things to drink while waiting. I will be back for any work I need done on my car. I've been going to this location for years for my oil changes."
Automotive,4.0,CG,Today I stopped in my car to get an oil change.  I pulled up to the desk and sat down.  The guy behind the counter said the oil change would take 2 hours.  I told him I'd be in a half hour.  I waited for the oil change.  I waited.  I waited.  I waited.  I waited.  I waited.  I waited.  I waited.  After about 45 minutes I finally got out of there.

After a couple of minutes, I got a call from the service manager saying that the oil change had been completed and that I needed to bring the car back in.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"If you have lived in Tampa for 20+ years and know nothing about cars, this is the place to go.  The people there are friendly and the service is fast.  The only thing that is lacking is that the staff is always working hard.  The only problem is that the workers don't actually have time to go over the cars.  If you have a problem with your car, they will pull it around and try to fix it.  It's very frustrating.  

I've been going to this Pep Boys for years and it's never bad either.  I've had my oil changed there and they have been friendly and helpful.  I've never had any problems and they're always willing to help.  I've never had an issue with any of the staff here"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I was putting my bicycle on the roof rack of my new car when the step stool I was on collapsed. I fell to the ground and the bike scratched the roof, the spoiler, and the hatch down to the bare metal. Dented the car and nicked the roof rack too. My car dealer recommended Moppert Brothers in Warminster for the repairs. Jeff, who later told me he used to work for an insurance company, did an excellent job documenting the damage and preparing the estimate. He sent me an electronic copy including the photos which I then forwarded to my insurance company. And even though the 4th of July fell in the middle of the week, I had my claim approved by Thursday afternoon. I dropped the car off the next Monday and picked it up on Thursday as promised. The body shop did an excellent job and the car looks as good as new. Outstanding customer service and repair service!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Saab's are great cars when they're well maintained. Finding a good Saab repair shop isn't always easy. During a recent trip to Tampa I remembered The Saaab Store. I used to live in Tampa and had taken my previous Saab to them. They have always provided excellent service at a great price so I decided to drop by with my new Saab so they could give it a once over. That was the best decision I could have made. They discovered three major problems that could have easily left me stranded on the side of the road during my return trip. Knowing that I had to get back on the road, they made my repairs a priority. They fixed a misfiring issue, corrected a problem with the timing and balance chain, and fixed the control arm and ball joint on the front wheels. All in one day at a fantastic price. I really wish there was a Saaab store where I live."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Buyer beware. I have never dealt with a more deceitful group of people than the employees at Bill Currie Ford, specially Ed P. (sales manager), Chris h. (sales), Mary S. (finance). My husband and I came in to purchase 2 used vehicles, sticker price for both was about 50k we negotiated the price to 43kout the door (10k down, the rest financed) we agreed and started the process. Once we were put with the finance department we started signing paperwork and transferring tags. While signing papers we found they kept rushing us to sign the loan documents and to give them the 10k payment. something didn't feel right. We stopped to read through the contact and added up the numbers. We found that they not only were trying to get us to finance the full 43k, but were also trying to charge us the additional 10k on top of that. They were trying to slip an extra 10k into our very clearly discussed deal."
Automotive,2.0,OR,I called prior to going here and they told me they could fit me right in for an inspection. I was there in 5 mins and they told me it would be 1. 5-2 hours. I said that was fine and went to the adjacent shopping plaza. They said they would call if any issues. About two hours later I hadn't heard from them so I decided to walk back over. The guy told me that the man buying my car I gotten a bigger job and it had taken more time. Needless to say they hadn't even started on my car. I was furious as I had just wasted two hours of my day waiting for my car that I thought was being worked on. I got at the counter apologized and asked me when I like to reschedule and I just walked out. the least they could've done what I've been to call me to tell me this.

They did not call the police on this lady even though her behavior was very suspicious. She stole another customer's keys.  My dad had not been in Florida 24 hours before this negligent car wash let his car be stolen. Then they didnt want to give him his money back for the car wash. The manager had the nerve to say ""well you did get your car washed""!!!!! Furthermore did not compensate with a rental while he waits to see if the police can find his car. Manager once again stated something foolish "" technically is not our fault""  I cannot believe a company would act this way after a customer's car was stolen because of their negligence.  This was my favorite car wash and I will not use again even if my life depended on it."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"OK based on my parents many issues years ago, I only come here for simple things:oil change & brake pads (haven't had to do yet) b/c of the fixed for life warranty.  I've only received oil changes here thus far & they're great. Never had an issue, never a major wait (at this location). When I need my brake pads replaced I'll probably buy mine then ask them to put them on (to save on costs). As far as repairs go I have a warranty on my car so I won't go here & even then I probably won't bring my Infinity here when the warranty is thru either; I just have trust issues based on my parents experience with Dobbs when I was growing up. But for oil changes you can't beat it...Do not go to Valvoline or Jiffy Lube but come here...Usually they don't try to upsell either like the places I just mentioned & they're also more trustworthy."

I couldn't tell who anybody was. No sales person ever approached me. They were all shirts untucked, couple guys smoking in the lot, nobody acknowledging anyone.

Automotive,5.0,OR,"Been coming here for years for tires new and used , rims , and other automotive work they are always the most up front and reasonable on pricing. They get super busy on the weekends so definitely try to go during the week but even if you have to wait you know you are getting quality work done right. I meet angel in 2008 at a local car show and decided to try his shop out after being treated with compassion and great customer service just inquiring about some tires. Ever since then this is my go to spot. If they had more shops I'm positive they would put every firestone out of business in that town they were in . If your looking for rims , tires new or used or auto work this is the place ! Doesn't matter if it's a daily driver or exotic they take care of you here . Thanks for the years of great service !"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I went to Courtesy Toyota after finding Stadium Toyota to be WAY expensive and unwilling to follow instructions (I replace water hoses regularly whether they need it or not--I explained that to them, they agreed to do it, kept the truck a day and refused to replace them--here's a bill for our time).

So I got to Courtesy hoping for better.  Repair work on Saturdays is clearly problematic so twice I amde appointments for the repairs and twice shoed up on time.  Both times it was as if the appointment was never made.  They did not have anyone readily available to doi the work and I got to wait with the rest of the mob for them to get to it.  IF a company encourages you to schedule repair work and then makes no effective effort to schedule technicians to do the work, what's the point?  Another wasted Saturday for what should have been less than an hours work."

They were able to diagnose the problem and get me in same day.  They got me in and out in under an hour.  They even gave me a ride home that was a plus.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"I've never had an issue with the actual work done to my vehicle- however this place seems to have an issue with integrity. They tried to charge me for 6 quarts of oil (for the second time) when I'm sure my car holds 4. 5 quarts (as indicated in the OWNERS MANUAL). they also tried to charge me double the price for an oil filter. I know it's double because I have saved every service receipt since I bought the car in June 2016. They adjusted my bill without too much hassle- but I feel bad for others who may not be as diligent in making sure they are not getting ripped off. Lastly, the woman who assisted me said ""sorry about that, you're on your toes"" like what?????? I gotta be on my toes to be charged fairly? I will drive the extra 15 mins to get my car serviced at David Jeep instead of my local dealership where I bought the car."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Whats up with these FAKE REVIEWS!?

How about this for real. Buying a car AS IS is the worst choice you can ever make when it comes to this dealer.

We got a car, that barely had 40k miles on it...

After our second payment, the head gasket went out.

All they can say is ""well, the title is in your name, no longer our problem"" and normally that is followed up by a hang-up.

So, these people will NOT take care of you. Unless you are a HIGH ROLLER and have the cash to blow on rubbish, don't even bother. 

This was our first car, and don't let them give you ""Your like family"" speech because, in the end, they abandon you. That is their TRUE customer care. As soon as you sign that contract... they will leave you to bleed out in there lies.

And whats funny is I am a Vet, and they don't even TRY to help. 
SO VETERANS & MILITARY, PLEASE DO NOT BUY HERE!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"This is one of the most disorganized car washes I've been too. We have the unlimited wash package. They just opened their Unlimited Members lane and so I pulled in there only to be told it's for exterior washes only. I asked where the sign was for that and their reply was ""Ya I know. They have to do something about that.""  Then I was told to back up and get in the other long line. I suggested they put a sign up and the response - I kid you not - was we're not allowed to do that. 

This is just the latest thing that's made me really reconsider going there. The attention to detail is gone ever since they stopped allowing us to tip individual workers - some were great and should be rewarded, but that doesn't happen anymore. I guess it wasn't ""fair"" or some such crap like that. 

My suggestion is to find another place. That's what I'm doing"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"This Autotire is horrible. The management staff is very rude. I've spent well over $6,000 throughout the years with them and I will never return. Issue 1: I have two vehicles and I always get my tires through them. The manager that assist me this particular day was overcharging me for tires and some mechanic work that I needed. I reached out to Autotire in Edwardsville, they gave me a much better quote. Same company, different people, better customer service skills. Issue 2: my blower on my vehicle had been going in and out. I called about the issue and it's $110 an hour for diagnostic. I simple ask if they could test the blower first because it was going in and out for the last several days. The response I get is, ""we can replace the blower if that's what you want but I can't guarantee it'll fix your issue."" The staff here is a joke and I hope they get replaced soon."

I spent a few months trying to find the best prices for my F150 and found that they had the most competitive prices around. I called ahead and got an appointment for the next day. They started on my truck as soon as I got there. They told me it would take about 2 hours to change the tires, change the oil, check alignment and fix any alignment issues. It only took them 1 and a half hours to finish everything. I will be taking my truck here for all future service because they don't try to sell you sh*t you don't need like JiffyLube and other car service places. I would recommend that you call ahead and get an appointment for routine service because it seemed they get busy quickly as the day goes on. I highly recommend this place"

Darren was very knowledge about the inventory of vehicles on the lot. Darren was also very professional in answering all of mine and my wife's questions. He offer us a test drive of a 2016 Lincoln MKX. Darren did a great job in finding an MKX in both the interior and exterior color that my wife wanted. I never thought I would trade in my wife Lexus for a Lincoln. But, I must say thanks to Darren and the folks at AutoNation Lincoln we are now the proud owners of a 2016 Lincoln.

Never reset the maintenance light and told my mother that it was an electronic issue with her car and need to be placed on the machine to check her car. And she had to pay roughly $60.00 to do so. She went to different pepboys and they were able to reset the light because they never did. Trying to take money from her for no reason. Please stay away from the pepboys at Cinnaminson.

I don't expect that everything goes my way but I do expect to be treated with empathy and respect and to be listened to.  I found Denise to be a model.

Automotive,3.0,OR,Went in yesterday looking to buy a used AWD Rav 4. Worked with Ricardo Morgan who did a outstanding  job showing and demonstrating the car. Took time to go over all the details and functionality. Ricardo was a model for quality customer service. We couldn't have been treated any better on the sales floor. Had an issue with the finance/contract office that wasn't realized until we got home and read the paperwork more carefully. This morning (Sunday!!!)  got a call from Sunny Davis from her home on her day off. She is taking measures to correct the problem first thing tomorrow morning. WOW !!!  I never expected such attention to customer service at a car dealer. Suffice to say we will be continuing customers here and I would recommend Precision to anyone looking for a new or used car. I am profoundly grateful to Ricardo and Sunny for making our experience at Precision a pleasure.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"My car would not start without being jumped. The battery was less than a year old and I purchased it at a different garage. I didn't have an appointment and for some reason that Monday was a particularly busy day. They said that they could work me in and run some diagnostics. Got a call an hour later stating that the battery was bad and because it was less than a year old if I had the receipt or could get it, they could replace the battery at no charge. They didn't have the battery in stock at their location, so they got one delivered from somewhere and charged $39 for diagnostics. 

Quick, friendly and great service. Their shuttle car is a big help too. I would have been stuck there all day (which would have been ok because they have free wifi), but they offered to take me home and then pick me up when my car was done.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"This car wash is not the best. It's decent because it's low cost. They offer several different car washes and I've tried them all and they all differ but never get the car completely clean. 

So my tip is go for the cheapest wash. Others aren't worth it as it never does what they claim. My wife had them bring her car through 3 times because she wasn't happy. The car was still not cleaned as advertised and she wasted over 30 minutes for nothing.  

They offer free self serve vacuums. You can ask for 2 tokens if you have a big vehicle. 

The track system here was never upgraded when the new owner took over and really does some hard pressure on your tires especially at the end of the car wash as you exit. 

There is some upgrades that need to be done to the wash system to make it better. I feel they they could even charge more if they would improve."

It took them about 2 hours to replace the windshield, longer than I would have liked but not the end of the world. I inspected my car immediately and noticed that the cowl below the windshield was scratched pretty deeply where their tech tried to prize the windshield out. 
The manager swore that his techs did not do it but did offer me $40.00 off of the repair, I accepted as I was already late getting back to work but would have preferred to have had the part replaced.

Took it back to JBs. Not only did they take it in right away and fix it in about an hour, they did it for no charge. 

They said they recognised the unit and more particularly the unique style of install as being theirs from that era. Apparently all of their installs carry a LIFETIME install guarantee. I didn't remember the lifetime guarantee and I didn't even have the original invoice any more. I was already happy they could fix it and I didn't need to spend a grand getting it removed and a new one installed.

They patiently waited for me to get parts from a friend, even though it turned out to be almost the same price as getting the parts the way that they do.  But instead of getting annoyed they just worked with me on it.  Then, my car was graffitied with permanent black marker, and they found something that took it right off (for basically nothing).  Finally, my back door latch broke, and I was moving to another city.  They ordered the clip just to get the part number for me, and didn't charge me anything, at 4:30pm on a Friday.

When I went to pick up my car, he had no idea what I was talking about.  He gave me an estimate of $10,000 for my car.  I asked him if the car was worth"
Automotive,1.0,CG,"I purchased a used engine from this dealership. The salesman, Joe, was very nice and helpful. I had a great experience. The car was clean and well maintained. I was pleasantly surprised by the cost and service they gave me. I would recommend this dealership to anyone. I have purchased many cars over the years and have had several excellent experiences. They have always made sure to take care of my family. I have a hard time finding a mechanic that is honest, respectful and not trying to up-sell me on anything I don't need. I am very happy with my experience at Cherry Hill Kia. This is my second time having my car serviced at this location. I've been going to this location for years for my oil changes, tires and other work."

I've had my car for a few years now and they've always been helpful and friendly. I've been here twice and it's always been a great experience. They will let you know if you need any additional services or even if it's just a simple tire issue. I've never had any issues with the service, but I've never felt like I was being taken advantage of or treated like a child. I will be coming back here for all my"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I work less than a mile away and stopped in for an oil change at 8:30 am.  Asked if they do ""while you wait"" oil changes.  Desk clerk said ""we do but not now, we're jammed up.  And we don't like to do while you wait oil changes because it jams up our entire day"".  
I asked if I could come back and desk clerk said they could do it at 11, 12, or 1.  So I asked if I could wait for it or would I need to drop off.  desk clerk said ""you can wait for it but you will have to be here at the exact time or else you will jam us up"".  I said never mind and left.  Desk clerk was perfectly fine with that.  
Sounds like they have a lot of jam up issues and could use some scheduling help.  I definitely got  the feeling they do not need any business."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Yesterday I was driving from Phoenix to Tucson when a large tire tread came flying at my car. Luckily, it did not hit my windshield but it did hit something under my car and immediately I heard an unusual noise.  After I pulled over, I looked for the closest auto shop to check out my car.  I admit I was still a bit shaken by the incident.  I pulled into the shop and even before I could tell my story, I was told something was hanging from my car. They quickly took care of the problem for me, assured me that nothing else happened to my car, that it was safe to drive, and handed me back my keys. They did not charge me one cent!!! As a woman from out of town and a bit upset, they could have said anything to me and told me something else was wrong.  I would not have known the difference.  Thank you being so kind."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I've driven past this business many times and pulled in Sunday while I was running errands to see if they could help fix something with my car that I have been putting off.  The second my husband and I got out of the car a woman with blonde hair in an older black Ford Escape immediately started berating us and telling us if we were going to the restaurant we would be towed.  We were so turned off by her accusatory, condescending attitude we got back in the car to leave.  I can't imagine how dealing with this company could have been when just pulling into the parking lot gets you talked to like that.  NOT ONLY THAT, this same female yelled at a woman with a child in the same exact way before we were even out of the parking lot.  Even if that woman was going into the restaurant, one of the employees speaking like that is so disrespectful and off-putting."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"After my awful experience with the service department, I have to give credit to Ed Brunton, Jr., who took it upon himself to fix the mistakes that had been made and make sure I was once again a happy customer.   He was able to get my car in for service for the same day (as he understood it was a safety issue, not just a run-of-the-mill ordinary service call that could wait), and kept in touch with me throughout the day to let me know the progress and what was being done to the car.  We did wind up using a rental for the day (a Malibu, which is too small for our everyday needs but was a really cool car and fun to drive for the day.  Special points for the lighting inside.)  Everything went very smoothly, even returning the rental car.   I really appreciated how Ed stepped up and helped.  It is good to know he is there."
Automotive,5.0,OR,I've known Al for over 20yrs and he's the only one I trust to fix my cars. I've never had anything go wrong after he fixed my cars the first time. He's always been honest upfront and direct when I comes to vehicles that he works on. The staff is great at Al's performance generally I am in and out in under an hour or two but other than that I never have to wait. Al is One of the best five star mechanics in the city of Philadelphia if not the best. So whenever my vehicle gets sick I always bring my vehicles to Dr. Al. He never gives a Band-Aid and say go on your way he always tends to give a full diagnosis before he hands me the keys to my car. Other than that I must say thank you Dr. Al. If you are in the Philadelphia area and you're having car issues please feel free to stop pass and see the mechanic doctor.

I took it to a few different places to get it checked out.  They said it was a bad battery and that the problem was a defective battery.  They told me to take it to the dealer to see if they could fix it.  I took it to the dealer where I bought the car.  They said they couldn't find the problem and it was a bad battery.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"This isn't a bad car wash. One token ($3) equals 3mins of whatever allowing you to switch to different modes. This makes it pricier than other options, but what I liked was than the two times I've been here there was no line up. Maybe the price turns everyone off, but what you pay in price you gain in time. It's a tough choice. 

The countdown is large and clear. All functions have the appropriate pressure to be effective. 

I should say that I used the coupon on the EM's 25$ coupon book to get free tokens her (it's two coupons of free tokens in the book). However, since I change my own oil now I probably won't get free tokens again. Tough to say if I'll ever be back now that I have to pay for token. I think the special is 33 tokens for 99$ with an extra 7 thrown in. It is pricey, but I do like the set up and availability of this car wash."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"This team is AMAZING! 

Let me start by saying I am a very picky customer and can be kind of demanding.... 

My sales team, Jolene Strozzi and Kenny Rose, were absolutely incredible to me! 

I came in to check out some different vehicle options and ended up with exactly what I wanted, at a price that was unbeatable, with extras to boot! They even drove to a dealership in Yuba City, 2.5 hours from Reno, at 5pm on a Friday to get my perfect vehicle to me as quickly as possible!!!! Sitting in rush hour for me?! Now, that's service! 

From their truthful, honest, to-the-point, no-nonsense salesmanship to their fantastic follow-up service, I can't stress enough how lucky I feel to have purchased from this team. The entire staff at Lithia Jeep was accommodating and caring every step of the way. I felt like I was buying a car from friends or family :) 

I would give them 10 stars if I could! They have a customer for life!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I picked up my truck today and I am beyond pleased about the outcome. It looks like it was never in an accident...I was concerned that it would never be quite the same. Not the case at all! They did a beautiful job! Also, they washed it and vacuumed the interior...I have kids and when I took the car seats out after I was rear ended there was a mess underneath, but when I picked up my truck today it was gone. That may seem silly, but to me that is incredible customer service and a nice treat! Also, the entire outside looks almost better than when I saw it last. And they also had great customer service, I received several update phone calls regarding the status of the repair and I was never kept guessing about when I would get my truck back. Overall I am so pleased with my experience and I will go to Coachcraft again if I ever need their services (fingers crossed I don't!)"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I've been in the market for a used Toyota 4Runner for the last few months, and hadn't been able to find just what I'd been looking for.  A few weeks back I spotted one on their website that was as close as I was going to find to spot on.  The body style I wanted, clean Carfax, 1 owner, low mileage, and best of all, the price was right.  Stacy, the Internet Sales Manager answered all of my questions and invited me in to check it out.  An hour later my wife and I pulled up to the dealership and it was sitting right up front waiting for us.  (Can't beat door to door service!)  From there we were introduced to Darren, who also took good care of us, and we were out the door in no time.  Simple process, great service all around, and I couldn't be happier with the truck.  I will definitely be back for my next one."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Warning: you must be very careful about service from this outfit!!!  Was quoted over $ 700 to remove and replace a faulty wiring harness. I had multiple dash lights blinking. I told the service gentleman that I would drive it home and consider their offer. In the driveway, I checked under the hood and to my pleasant surprise a battery cable was loose!!  I tightened it and have not had the problem in over a year now. And my bank account shows 700 to the plus side!

And, folks ""if"" you have to replace a starter on a Honda, BEWARE: do not use after market starters. I was told that '08 Honda's are ""particular"" about the starters used and the computer-system does not read an odd starter. Starters usually are somewhere around the 200-300 range. Nope, not a Honda. Replacement labor and starter (Honda OEM) 850. I'll not buy another Honda and will hopefully get honest service elsewhere."

I will be back!I was referred to Caliber by my insurance company and I'm so glad I did. I needed a new transmission, and Caliber was able to do it in a reasonable amount of time.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"Having read positive reviews on this site, and having just moved into the neighborhood, I was so happy to find a local auto repair shop with whom to establish a relationship.  The oil change I scheduled was completed for $84.  But my attempts to inquire about any number of other auto repairs were met with such resistance, and repeated statements about how busy they are, that I left scratching my head wondering why they're scheduling new jobs in the first place.  During the time I was there waiting for the work to be done, the phone didn't ring and no one else came in the shop.  I can be very flexible in terms of timing, I work from home, I live within walking distance of the shop and yet the person I spoke with put up so many obstacles to doing more work on my car that I gave up.  I feel like the positive reviews I read must have been talking about another shop!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I needed a car. I saw a Nissan Pathfinder I loved. My sales guy won the presidential or top award from the company.   He was very like likable and charismatic.  Once he quoted me my monthly payment, it was too high.  I told him that.  He kept tying to see if there was able to do something. The monthly amount kept going up. 

He suggested I buy and re-finance in a few months.   Turns out, he ran my credit report 7 times!!!!  7 times!!   Of course that affected my credit.  It takes 2 years to resist.  When I went else where.  It was challenging cuz I had so many credit reports ran on me.  

He didn't want me to be able to get a car elsewhere.  Dirty.   So crazy.  

If I could give them a negative rating i would.  

This place is about sales and doesn't have the customers best interest."

Mind you before I got into the car they told me it went through their inspection and everything was perfect. After I pointed out the seat issue they wouldn't come down on the price but agreed to take the car Honda for repairs. I have a voicemail from Steven stating that the repairs were done. I show up a few weeks later, ready to buy and guess what, the seats still don't work. I ask for the vehicle service report....NO SEAT REPAIRS TO BE FOUND! Salesman checked the system, came back to say the repairs never happened. I don't do business with liars. If you're planning on buying that Blue 2016 Honda Accord just know the heated seats are broken and so are the subwoofers in the back. Which they didn't change their advertising to reflect that when they found out these issues weeks ago! Buyer beware!"

I saw a fan that I really liked for over 400 bucks, but then there was a yellow sign on it which set for sale for $279. I grabbed it, went up to make my purchase and immediately the cashier began trying to sell me on some membership for an additional $30 in order to get the price of 279. I tried to explain, I can buy it online for $279 without having to purchase a membership to have the advertised price honored. Then some other cashier came and interrupted me and said yeah but you have pay shipping. Yep, I sat in Camping Worlds parking lot and ordered it online. Let's see, free shipping and purchase at the advertised price, or pay for this scam $30 + tax + $279. Easy decision. I thought after all these years, things may have changed. You lost my business yet again Camping World."

I love the fact that they have a coffee machine that makes the wait time for your car to be done is usually around 45 minutes.  I've also had a few other issues with the service but they have always been very efficient and kind.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Mister Car Wash isn't consistent. It's unfortunate that that statement is true no matter which location you go to. And not to mention, overpriced. I decided to pop in on a Friday afternoon around 1:00 pm. I picked my overpriced car wash and, as always, they pushed their 29/ month ""deal"" and I politely declined. The problem this time really got me annoyed more than anything. It's no secret that most go to Mister because of the free vacuums. But it's understood that one would pay for a wash to use them. Well, I got out of my wash and every single port was being used. I circled the lot a few times and I looked closer. I realized Mister staff park their cars in the vacuum spaces. This is pretty unfortunate and the customer should not have to wait long to use any of the 16 ports. But apparently staff can hog them by parking them. That's not the staff's fault. But it's a clear sign of poor business management."

He thought at first that I may need to take it to the dealer when I told him about the corrosion.  But he took a look at it and was able to get the connector off and clean it up so it could be reconnected to a new battery.   He spent a very long time working on getting all the corrosion off.  It was a lot more work than a simple battery change.  He could have just said it was too much work to do and would require too much time, but he didn't.  I don't post too many reviews, but I am just so impressed and thankful for all the work Steven did for my battery purchase that I had to post a 5 star recommendation."

He helped us to pick the perfect Honda Pilot for us and helped us to get the best deal possible with Sandy Ware's help. Brian knew that time was an issue when we came in to sign paperwork two days later, and he and Ed Lage worked in unison to expedite the vehicle training and the paper signing in record time for my boyfriend to be out the door with time to spare to take an important business call he was expecting. We were both highly impressed and satisfied by Brian, Sandy and Ed's professionalism, warmth and prompt attention to details to expedite our transaction.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"I own a 1997 Honda Accord. During 2002 or 2001 there was a recall done by Honday on oil cap or something. I missed the deadline. I went a month later for an oil change. As soon as I paid my bill and drive off the parking lot, my light "":check motor"": comes on. I drive back and they said :""well that recall cap thingy....we have to fix it but you are not covered any longer"": so I had to pay $400+ right there. I felt like they made the problem for me to rip me off.

Another time I went to them because my tires were loosing air for no damn reason. They charged me $149 per one tire and said they fixed it. A month later the same tier continued to loose air and eventually it fell apart. I ended up buying all 4 tires from them but now I save my recepits. I know they are liars and cheaters.

I am really looking for another mechanic who won't cheat me."

It was because of all the positive reviews, that I decided to give it a shot and I wasn't disappointed. Chris was very welcoming and got me in and out in no time and he didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. In fact, the brake issue that I thought I had, turned out to be nothing and he gave me his honest opinion. The only downfall is that the technician who drove my car up to the front door when it was finished seemed to have an attitude. I told him ""thank you sir"" and he didn't acknowledge me or say anything in return... not even a head nod! it just rubbed me the wrong way I guess... but he still did a good job on the car I guess and overall it was a good experience so I'm still giving it 5 stars and I'll be back."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I'm just visiting Tucson but my mother takes her van to Vistoso Automotive for regular maintenance as well as repairs. I was driving her van, made a stop and then it wouldn't start. I made sure it was towed to Vistoso Automotive since that's where she gets all her work done. It was Friday at 3pm and they close at 5:30pm so I wasn't too optimistic that they'd even get to it. They squeezed it in despite the fact they were extremely busy. The diagnosis: a bad fuel pump which made sense given that it was cranking and not starting. They didn't have a fuel pump on hand but then no one stocks fuel pumps for all make and models. They gave me a ride and the part will be in Monday and I'll be out by noon. Yes, I'm confident enough to write the review before I pick it up. As I said, my The place is modern and clean with windows between the waiting area and the garage bays."
Automotive,5.0,CG,I called because we were close to the dealership and they said they couldn't help us. We asked them to call the dealer. The dealer said they would be there in a couple of hours. They had no clue where to be. Then they told us they had to order the parts and they would be there in a few hours. When we got there they told us they had already ordered the parts and had to order the parts. They never called us back. They said they would have it done in two weeks. The dealer said they couldn't get it done that day. We called and they told us they couldn't get it done that day because they could not order the parts. I asked them if they could order the parts and they said they could. They said they had to order the parts and they would have to order the parts.
Automotive,1.5,CG,"This place is a complete rip off and the owner is a total scumbag. I just wanted to get an oil change and inspection. He then said he didn't have time to do it. I told him I would be back for it. He said ""It's not going to be a problem."" I said I wanted to make sure I had a good day. He said ""I just want to make sure you can go to the dealership because it will be very busy."" I said fine, I'll just wait. He walked out, came back with a ""new"" oil filter and it was $20 more. He was super nice and not pushy. I said ok, I'll check it out, and I'll see how it goes. He said ""it will be $20."" I said, ""No, no, we'll"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I came in with an appointment to have the oil changed.  I was told the person who was working on the car said the guy at the front desk was ""out of his way"" to make sure everything was fixed.  

I then brought my car back in for the oil change.  They said the oil change was free and the mechanic at the front desk said it was free.  I then asked why it was free and they said that the guy at the front desk said that it was because the oil filter was changed, which I was told was not true.  

I ended up bringing my car back in because of the car not being serviced correctly.  They told me I could get it serviced at the dealership for free because it was free.

I also bought the car from them a couple of years ago and had no issues. The next day I had some issues with the car. The car was not a luxury car but a luxury vehicle. I had to call them to see if they could take care of it. They said they would call me. Two days later I called and they said they could not take care of the issue. They would have to order the part, but I had to wait a week and a half for them to call me. When I went to pick up the car I found out they never got the part.

They always take care of me.  I've had a few minor things to fix and they've been very fair with me.  I've had to go to another shop (of course) for something that they couldn't find.  I have been going to these guys for a long time and have always been happy with their work.  They've never tried to up sell me on anything I don't need.  They're always honest and fair with pricing.  They've even helped me out with a few small things that needed to be fixed on my vehicle."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"It's shocking LNT doesn't have more reviews. I knocked my rim on a curb and was very upset about it. I just went on yelp and searched rim repair, this was the first company to come up. I simply texted a photo to the phone number, within minutes they responded with an estimate, date and time. I dropped off my Bronco on a Friday, picked it up Monday. An extremely seamless transaction, and I got more than what I paid for. The price is extremely fair. The Rim is back to how it looked when it came out of the factory, it doesn't look ""like"" new, it is new. I met the owner when I got my keys, extremely nice guy. He locked me in as a permanent customer.
One thing, the garage is not exactly on the street so it is easy to miss. When you see the Caliber Collision sign, that is when you turn down the driveway and you'll eventually see the LNT box truck parked. 
THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!!!!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"As someone who was previously disappointed with NTB and moved to Costco, when the time came for new tires everyone I knew told me that I should go to Discount Tire.

When I arrived, I was greeted at the door. Literally.  Before I could get inside the building a sales rep was there to ask me about my needs. When I explained I needed to see about getting a tire repaired, or replaced he was immediately excited to help me and take a look.

As it turned out the tire could not be repaired, but the agent effortlessly transitioned to sales mode. Finding affordable tires with the amazing Road Hazard warranty they have. They only ask that you repurchase the warranty on a repaired tire and they will repair or replace it until it drops below legal tread level. 

The tires were purchased and on the vehicle within 45 minutes and off I went with my life.

Discount Tire is obviously trying to make new customers for life, and it absolutely worked for me."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I have received service from this location intermittently over the last several years for my truck. Today I went in with an appointment for an oil change and to purchase new tires. I anticipated waiting while the work was done, and was told they would have a tire quote in 5 Minutes. Two hours later, I had not received any update so I checked. The service advisor told me that my truck had not even been assigned to a tech. He said he had no idea when it would be done so offered me a loaner car. I then waiting in line for another 30-45 minutes and no one helped me. After conversing with another customer who had been waiting for 5 hours with no status, I decided to leave with my truck receiving no service. The most frustrating part of it all was that no one seemed to care about providing good service and that this was status quo. I highly recommend staying away from here for service, sales, or anything."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"So my car had a recall and after checking out the reviews on Yelp of different toyota dealerships in the area to do the work required, I decided on this dealership in late Jan. Scheduling the work was easy. The work could only be done on the weekdays (sucks) but they close late (yay). They don't seem like a ""walk-in"" rype of service. Also They are not a really warm and fuzzy group but were professional. Later in the day I got a call that my car needed additional work ans woild cost me over $200. Funny that this was the first time somone told me about this work even though I had been to a dealship in Chicago in Nov and just got service at another shop just days prior. Yeah, no, don't touch my car for nothing eles but the recall. No push back, which was good. They had my car done by the end of the day. 

While I appreciate the work done, I would not come here again."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I had a very poor customer service experience at flight park. I have since spoken with the owner, and I know his intentions are to make it right. I appreciate him reaching out, although I do hope future customers receive better service from the start. My baby stroller was somehow broken by the flight park driver in the process of moving it from vehicle to vehicle. I know that accidents happen, but the way I was treated after the fact was the main issue. After speaking with several employees, I was met with defensiveness, blame, apathy and hostility. I was told that it is my fault that it's broken because ""I told him to do it."" The first response was to accuse rather than listen or problem solve. I believe one of the managers had good intention, but the whole experience was still very frustrating. I hope that future customers have better experiences when trying to resolve issues, but I do appreciate the owner calling to discuss the issue after the fact."

The only thing that I didn't like about this place was that they had a coffee bar for customers. The staff is always friendly and they have a great selection of coffee and snacks. They also offer a lifetime warranty. I just went there to have some work done on my car and it took about 30 minutes. Overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.Worst car wash ever.  The man working the front desk was rude and not helpful at all.  I had to pay for the ""wax"" to get it off and I got my car back.  My car was filthy and the car was filthy from the first wash I got."

Well it was a month later and I didn't have a new battery. I am extremely happy with the service and the price. I would buy another car from them again.I have been going to this Jiffy Lube since I moved to Nashville and have always had great service at a good price.

I was in and out in about an hour and they even told me that I needed new tires, which I thought was very fair, and I was in and out in about an hour!

Overall, it was a great experience. They didn't try to up sell me, and they were very polite and friendly. They didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need, and I didn't feel like they were trying to up sell me on unnecessary services"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I had the worst experience here. The car wash itself was a joke, the guy was rude and dismissive. The workers were nice, but the manager seemed annoyed that I was there and that I was standing there. I will NEVER go back. I had a great experience here. The guys were extremely helpful and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to get my car serviced. I will recommend them to anyone I know!I recently purchased a brand new Tacoma from Chapman Ford and have had nothing but problems with the service department. They lied about what was happening and why it needed to be fixed. When I was driving home from work, the check engine light came on and I stopped at the dealership to get it fixed. They told me I had a bad fuel pump and it would cost me $200 to fix."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Recently purchased a preowned Cadillac from Plaza.  I won't comment on the purchase itself  -  I expect there to be a lot of back and forth and was not disappointed in the process.  I think we arrived at a reasonable price.   There were a couple of things on the car that needed fixing and Plaza gave me a ""we owe"" form indicating the items to be fixed.  I purchased the car on a Saturday and was told I'd be called on the next Monday to schedule the repairs.  I did not  hear from Plaza the next Monday or by the following Monday, so I called them and was told the next available appointment was for the next Monday........Not happy that the ball was dropped on the repairs, but once I did get the car in for service (at Elco Cadillac), the process was great.   Good follow up by the person at Plaza to make sure the repairs were done to my satisfaction."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Stay Away!
Over an hour for an oil change and don't be fooled by the $11.99 oil change special. Once they add all the BS fee's you are looking at over $18, big difference. It also took over an hour.
I also asked them to take a look at an exhaust leak and to give me a estimate to repair. When I checked out I asked about that problem and they never even looked at that for me. 
When I got home I noticed that a hub cap was missing so I drove all the way back to get it. When I told the mechanic (I use the title loosely) who worked on the car that it was missing, he looked all through his bay and came back to me and said he put it on the car. I told him that doesn't seem to be the case in which he replied "" well it must of come off down the road"" and then walked away.

I originally presented to a nearby popular name-car garage, not being familiar with the AAMCO location.  I encountered a subpar experience at the first place, which I'm happy I did.  From the moment I first called and presented to AAMCO, the manager Mustafa was extremely courteous and professional, immediately able to sense the knowledge and experience he carries.  He was extremely efficient in dealing with my particular situation of extended warranty authorization, being relentless in order to expedite the repair process.  He was as thorough as I have ever experienced at an automobile repair facility, having frequented numerous places over the years across the country.  He also holds a genuine interest in helping the customer and my overall experience could not have been better.  I strongly recommend Mustafa and AAMCO Oldtown Fredericksburg, he and his team are excellent."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I have had dozens of vehicles (personal and business) tinted at this location as well as remote starters installed. If you pay attention to details and follow the maintenance rules of new tint, (don't roll windows down/basically leave them alone for a week) then return the following week for inspection and warranty, they will look professional. On the one rare occasion that I had a concern with a tint install, it was promptly removed and replaced at no cost. As for seams on large curved windows, you get what you pay for. You want seamless on large curved areas, that takes time, and time =$. I had requested the lesser expensive seam install on a particularly curvy rear window on a Cooper, and you could barely notice. Ed and Ron are matter of fact, experienced professionals. If you are seeking an entertainment session, go to Dave and Buster's. If you want quality auto accessories and service at reasonable prices, the WHP in Audubon, NJ is the spot."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I have never had such awful service from a dealership before that charged premium prices for service and Ford parts. On Tuesday, I made the service technician aware of the urgency of my repair, as I was trying to get my car sold. The car was not repaired until the following Monday and I had to call multiple times every single day to get an update. At one point he even told me that my repairs were complete and I could pick it up, only for him to call me back and tell me it was a mistake. He was unable to explain the delay and each time said it would be the very next day. My repairs were $1700 and I was not given a discount on the labor for being patient throughout the extreme delay. The day after I picked up the car, the check engine light came on. My decision to not buy a Ford, or from this Ford dealer, was made solely on my experience with the service department."

Great place to get your oil changed.I have been going to O'Rielly for my oil changes for over a decade and have never had any issues. They are very honest and do a great job. I have recommended them to several friends and family. I never feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I have used O'Rielly for over 15 years and they have been great.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"1 star is way more than this slap-dick operation deserves. Not only was I treated poorly by the manager (I guess he doesn't like groupons), but after they finished up, they bent my hood latch (which is a fantastic place to put a prop rod), and then after about 30 times of him and some other mouth breather trying to slam it shut, I now have a hood that won't close, and nice reverse dent in my hood. He tried to tell me that is was the make and model of my SUV as to the reason for their blunder. Thankfully I took it to Sierra up the street, and they fixed what they ruined. I then wrote their corporate site telling them of this, and asking what they would do to make it right... this was 4 months ago, and I still haven't heard a thing.

I spoke to Dwayne in parts who informed me that they keep many in stock but that I would need to bring the vehicle in to determine which I needed. Unfortunately, they did not have the one I needed in stock and it was the end of the day. Michael from sales suggested letting me borrow the key from service to remove the keyed nuts and replace them with non-keyed nuts from the parts department. This was the perfect solution and now on my old 2007 GX I will never need to use the key again and I was able to bring the car back to Mavis to have my tires mounted. I would just say that the level of customer service that was provided to me in a time of need was awesome and unexpected. Thanks, Michael and Dwayne!"

I went through with my friend in her car and while we were in the tunnel we seemed to be getting really close to the car in front of us. My friend had done everything right, was in neutral and was doing her makeup. Towards the end of the tunnel we bumped into the car in front of us. The track was stopped and the car in front of us pulled forward to the front of the building. A worker came out to us and suggested that since we were operating the vehicle it was our fault. False. She said we should get the other drivers insurance, and when we looked at the other car, it was a mister car wash employee. So either they were operating the car in the tunnel or they led us onto the track too early. Either way it felt like they were trying to blame us for what happened and I don't appreciate that as a customer."

Third: I don't like auto mechanic places because of what I heard about cheating you out of money. So I'm trying to watch my truck which is hard to do because you have little window in the waiting room. So I asked if I could go out there to watch. He said yes but wait. A half hour after my truck has been there, he's says okay go ahead. I didn't like that.

The workers just took their time and chitchatted with one another. Second of, when my stepdad opened the hood of my car he noticed that there was oil EVERYWHERE. They did not wipe the spills, just left it. Third of all, they did not notify me that any of my liquids needed to be refilled. Fourth of all, the service worker who changed my oil did not know simple math. The oil that I got is good for 3,000 miles. I am currently at 5,700 miles. So the next time I would need to change my oil is 8,700 miles. On my sticker he wrote 6,010, that is obviously NOT 3,000 miles. I would never recommend their services to anyone."

Little did I know, their service would be outstanding! I was treated with respect and kindness, as was my car. It was returned to me completely detailed and the repairs were indistinguishable from the rest of the car.
I once again had to go there this week. It was like walking into an old friend's house. Don and his dad (who doesn't seem to age) both treated me like family. Once again, the repair was fast, cheap and perfect! Not only did they match the paint but they got all the doghair out of the interior, which I can't seem to ever do!

The three guys there today worked seamlessly talking back and forth to signal the draining the filling etc.  (I also saw them fill it and they verified no leaks and showed me the dipstick when they were done.  I am sold hope we have these back home. Got back to the hotel no problems so far. If I had read the reviews earlier I wouldn't have gone but seems either the staff has changed or I made it on a good day."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"READ THIS REVIEW!   The sales team are well intentioned and the finance manager was exceptional.  More importantly, a business of this size should have their customer service and communication processes improved upon.  Four calls with no return until I finally developed a communication stream with a sales associate and when I walked in to pay for a new unit in full, a certain fee was not communicated until just before sale.  It was then recommended that I travel to my local bank and return with cash or a cashiers check.  That was distasteful.  It is a shame that a business like this is run in this way.  Another sign that they're unlikely to change is a lack in response to their reviews.  If the unit that I wanted was available in Murfreesboro, I would have visited Sloan's Motorsports for a more personable experience.  I wish this company the best in luck, and if things keep on this path, they may want to explore self-checkout options."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Going all the way back to 2005, we bought our first tent trailer from here, got a great deal, great service. In 2008 we traded up our tent trailer to a travel trailer, again, great service, in 2012, we outgrew our trailer and bought a larger one, this trailer had issues from the get go and it was like pulling teeth to get it fixed, which we finally did after much arguing....this brings us to today. We found a trailer there that we really liked, they wanted to crazy lowball us on our trade in. (20% below LOW value, our current trailer is in perfect condition) after purchasing 3 trailers previously, you'd think they'd have worked with us a little bit, they did...a very tiny bit. After leaving and posting something about it on social media, I've found out that other friends have been having horrible issues with them, especially when it came to warranty work on their now advertised ""complete warranty for life"", it's a joke, beware...I personally will never buy from them again."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I have been to this location a number of times over the years.  Every time I have been there, they seem quite busy and there is a line up.  They usually have at least a few people working there at a time, so even though the line seems long, it doesn't take as long as you may think. Usually, I have to wait in line for around 15 to 20 minutes.

The staff there seem decently trained and usually can get what job you are asking done without any problems.  However, there has been a couple of time I needed things done by them and the staff wasn't sure how to do it, so she had to ask someone else for help and it took a little longer to get the job done for me.  The friendliness of the staff is a hit or miss for me, In the past, I have had some friendly staff serve me, but most recently the staff that helped me was not that friendly or kind."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"On Saturday 08/11, I noticed that my car was parked in the middle of the street. I called the number given to me and the lady said that she would be calling me back in 10 minutes. I called back and was told that they were working on it and to call me back in 10 minutes. I waited for another 10 minutes and waited another 10 minutes. I finally called back in 10 minutes and was told that I had to call the number given to me. I waited for another 20 minutes to get someone to tell me that my car was parked in the middle of the street. When I went to speak to the lady that answered the phone, I was told that she had no idea what I was talking about. I was then told that I would be told to come in at 5:30 PM and they would have to give me the information I needed."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Started off the day with a flat tire. 

I called my insurance company and they said they would have the tire repaired, but they said the tires were in great shape and that it was a little over a year old. 

I called to ask if they would be able to repair the tire, and they said yes. 

I showed up and they told me they would have to order the tire and to come in. 

I got there and they said they would be there the next day, and they called me at 11:00. 

They had my car for a few days, but when I went to pick up the car, I realized they had left a huge screw in my tire, and didn't have the tire in stock.

I waited in the lobby for 20 minutes. I was told that they would have the vehicle ready by the end of the day. I had to wait on hold for another 30 minutes. I was told that they were able to look at it and they would call me later. I went to pick up my vehicle and the brakes were fine. I called back at 3:00 and was told that they had not yet worked on it yet. I left a message that was never returned. I called them again and was told that they were unable to find the issue and I would need to go in and have them look at it. I went in and was told that they could

The staff was very nice and professional. The waiting room was very clean and comfortable. I was very pleased with the service and the price. 

I had some issues with my car and they took care of it. They also helped me fix them by hand. I didn't think they had ever been able to fix it right then and there. They even called me after a few days to tell me it was ready. I'm very happy with the service I received and would highly recommend them.I had a great experience with AutoNation Nissan.

I was looking for a new car for my daughter. I was looking for a new car, but unfortunately my daughter was going to be in a car accident, and we ended up with a brand new car. They went above and beyond for us, and were able to get us the car we wanted. I can't say enough good things about this dealership. We went in the next day to look at a used Honda."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Never again. These ""professionals"" yeah ok more like incompetent. Oil change was done on Saturday, never had any issues with any leaks. Today it was down to 2 quarts. Took it back and they stated that when oil was changed, the person changing it must had stripped the hole in the oil pan and now the screw just twist and does not tighten up. Their response to that was, we can't do nothing about it but just top it off. Also 
the manager on Saturday treated my daughter like she was trying to screw Jim out of money, because she had a coupon from the dealership stating oil changes with Jiffy Lube will be a certain amount. He stood there and try to talk down to my daughter. So my daughter went off on him the way he was to her. DONT ever go to this place...I can honestly say my daughter stated that the young lady up front tried her best to apologize to her, which my daughter told her it was not her fault.."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Nice guys.  Convenient location to downtown Eagle.  We had to wait a week to get in so they are busy.   After diagnosing the initial problem and fixing it, they then found a lot more wrong after the initial repair.   Great communication and patience to explain and answer my questions but prices seemed way too high.  After getting the most urgent work done, I drove my car across town for a second opinion from a trusted mechanic friend  and was told at least one of the major recommended repair items was not needed.  

In a nutshell, I cannot recommend Eagle Auto repair for much more than a diagnostic and/ or repairs and maintenance you know you you need.   Most of the recommended work that they stated was true, but not all were necessary and their prices were also way over inflated.  One of the biggest and priciest repairs they recommended that was urgent was bogus so I'm so glad that I got a second opinion."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Just yesterday I had my oil changed at my nearby Mavis in somers point but they forgot to put the oil plug back in. I was on 55 heading to Philly for the weekend
 when my low oil pressure alarm came on. I was towed to this Pep Boys and received awesome service! I called ahead and spoke with Matt. After I made sure they were open and had the special oil I needed, Matt said he couldn't make any promises about fixing my car. Upon arrival, Matt met me at the counter and checked my car right away. That's when he found the oil plug sitting in the splash guard. He put more oil in my car, replaced the plug, and checked the filter. To top it off, he didn't charge me anything! He said I had a rough enough day as it was. He didn't have to do that but I certainly appreciated it. Thank you Matt for your caring service!! I wish I lived closer, I'd get all my car service done here!!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had a great experience purchasing a new car from Webster Groves Subaru and highly recommend them. My first contact was with Lisa Grimm, their internet sales specialist. She was awesome. She gave me a quote very quickly and offered a great price. Kaia Johnson was my sales consultant when I went to pick up my car. She was awesome too. extremely knowledgeable, helpful and friendly, had everything ready to go when I arrived, and got me through the process quickly. The trade in for my old Subaru went smooth and I got a good price for my trade in. Don Barker, the business manager was also great. quick and efficient. This is my fourth Subaru and the team at Webster Groves made it the best purchase experience I've had. Great price, no games, excellent customer service. I trust them and will continue to do business with them in the future. Shout out to the service department too! Have been a customer of there since I moved here a year and a half ago. Another great Webster Groves Subaru team."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"If I could rate a 0, I would. I have been trying to reach someone about their vacuum that ate my money for 6 weeks now. I have called the number on the office door and left messages. I have also sent them an email. It started a few weeks before Christmas when the vacuum took my $1 in quarters. No big deal. (A man there after me had the same issue and told me this always happens there). I called and left a message. With it being close to the holidays, a few days with no call back was okay. Days turned to weeks. So, I emailed them. No response. I waited another two weeks and went back to see if anyone was there. No one could be found. Called the number on the door again last week. Still no reply. Their lack of commitment to their customers is upsetting and disrespectful. From now on I will use the car wash up the street that has a free vacuum and employees there during business hours."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Nice facility. It was pretty busy in the middle of the day because it was the day after New Years and most people were off. They offer packages and I used the platinum package that is $50 unlimited washes. It's worth it if you come more than 2x because the platinum wash is 34.99 by itself. They have other options that range in price but platinum is the highest I believe. It is a pretty smooth operation. Drive up and tell them what you want. They mark it on the window and you go inside. You pay the cashier and have the option to watch your car being washed. They offer free refreshments and the inside is nice, cool, and with comfortable seating. I also noticed they offer oil changes which is pretty convenient. After you car comes out there is a staff to wipe it dry and they raise their hands when it's done. Tipping is optional but you should tip. They are outside in the hot sun all day making your car look nice!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I have no complaints about towing but collision shop is terrible. My vehicle was left here for repairs of front bumper which took over 6 weeks to complete. It took so long to complete that my insurance company refused to continue paying for a rental car. Jimmie's 24-hr towing agreed to pay for rental for remainder of duration of repairs but never set up rental car and when I put my credit card to hold vehicle, I later found out I was billed. When I contacted Enterprise and told them to bill Jimmie's, it was apparently refused so Enterprise held me liable. Additionally when I received my vehicle, two days later a panel literally flew off while driving. The shop did agree to replace the panel but only after much delay and a couple reminders to order the part. If you are trying to get a hold off the shop manager, good luck as he is always off somewhere. Hopefully I never need collision repair again but definitely will not be relying on this horrible shop."
Automotive,5.0,CG,Took my 2017 Jeep GC here for the first time in two years.  The entire process was quick and painless.  I will definitely return for any future service.  I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone in need of a new or pre-owned car.The staff was friendly and helpful. I was able to get in and out in less than an hour. I also got a free oil change with the oil change. They even vacuumed my car when I got home. I highly recommend this place.I've been going to this place for about a year now.  They are always honest and reliable.  They've never tried to up sell me on anything I don't need.  They're always willing to take care of me and my car.  I highly recommend.Went to get my car detailed today and was very happy with the results.
Automotive,2.0,CG,"A possible old people's scam. 

I'd give them a zero if I could. 

I am very disappointed. 

I have a credit score of 4.5%. They had no clue where to go. They had my credit score of 4.5%. I had a 2.5% interest rate, which was $100 below what I was told. They didn't have the time to put the down payment on my loan and that's why I'm not going to pay it off now. I have a credit score of 5.5%. I was told that I had to put down $3,000 on a new car. I was told that they had the loan and it was a loan. I went home and got my credit score of 7.0% with my credit score of 6.0%. I'm not a liar."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"Interesting that I had to go back and forth to a mechanic after I had just taken my car to a different mechanic. The mechanic, Eric, then told me that the oil was fine and that it was still under warranty. I was extremely pleased with the service and the price. I also had a coupon for a free oil change and a free car wash. I will definitely be returning here for my next oil change.I was referred to Caliber by my insurance company and I'm so glad I did. I needed a new battery, and they helped me with everything. They were very friendly and fast and efficient. I really appreciated their patience and kind demeanor.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"The employees, convinence and price were perfect! The parking lot was covered and easy to find. We were greeted with a smile and a newspaper, told where to park and were immediately scooped up by the shuttle, again with a smile from the driver. When we returned to the airport four days later, we were picked up by a smiling, friendly shuttle driver within about 3 minutes of reaching the waiting zone. We were driven back to the car, not a general area, but directly to the car, where the driver helped us off the shuttle, took our bags to the car then waited until we opened the car door before driving off. I want to say that they earned even extra points for salting the parking spaces, bonus! We drove to the booth where we were greeted with a smile once more and paid the very low price that was advertised, and sent on our way with 2 complimentary cold bottles of water. This service is A+, the only one we will use from now on!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I would give this car wash a negative. Do not take your car through this bs car wash ! Pull up only the 7 buck wash is available, so I go through it the lady  working was really sweeet totally not her fault ! My rim gets stuck in the rim  thing while drying , it turns my tires the whole system shuts down , so I sit there for a minute then I figured I guess I need to get out I punch it to get out pull to side to see the chunk out of my brand new car rim , the lady tells me to go to website and call that number I call they Number and it's been changed . And I can't even get on the website as if there isn't one ! I need a new rim ! I have a brand new car and didn't want a rim  to be chunked ! And didn't even clean my car  good ,more importantly my rim is messed up"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This place is horrible. We took our our brand new Subaru Outback there to get the works; wash in and out and best quality wax. We were in a hurry so we never took the time to assess their work quality. It was poor. The inside looked as if they didn't do anything. The outside looked good (keep in mind it's 2 weeks old). The was appeared fine at first but now it has discolored the black trim pieces all over. I tried to clean it off with water to no avail. I'll have to go to the parts house and buy some Armor All type stuff to give that a try. If that doesn't work they will hear from me (again). I say again because we took it back to have the inside redone. They did the same quality as they did the first time; poor. What a waste of time and money. Never again!  You'd think for $80 with a $5 tip you'd get what you paid for?  Nope, not there."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Just got a 428i from here. The dealership is a good deal. The buying experience was awesome. They gave us the best deal possible. The finance manager was great. The sales manager was awesome. We worked with him to find a good car for us and he was very friendly. He was a pleasure to work with and did not push us to buy something we didn't need. We didn't feel pressured to buy or even try to get anything more than we needed. We will definitely buy from them again. Thanks, guys. I've been here several times, never had a problem and the service is always fast and courteous. The only reason I gave them four stars is because I had to take my car to get looked at and I was told to come in at 7:30am and they would have it done by the end of the day."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Was in the market for a new car and we decided to see a Honda Pilot. We were able to get the car we wanted, but they didn't have the color we were looking for. They had no clue where the car was, and told us it was still available. The salesman was a bit rude to us, and we felt like we were inconveniencing him. After asking for a different salesman to assist us, we were told he was ""too busy"" and that he could come in to help us, but no one was available. We called him up, and he told us it was a different salesman that was going to try and help us. We were on the phone with him about the car, and he told us he would be back to see us at the end of the day. We never heard from him again. Finally we decided to go down the street"
Automotive,3.0,CG,"If I wrote a review, I would be very disappointed. My wife and I purchased a new vehicle in the early 90s. We have had our vehicles serviced at this dealership since 2009 and we have been very pleased with their service. The service manager, Ashley, is a very friendly and helpful salesman. I had a very good experience with her and the service department. This time I took my vehicle to get serviced and a recall item fixed. The service department is very busy, so I was able to schedule an appointment with Ashley to have a loaner vehicle and get work done. The next day, I went to pick up the vehicle and found out that the recall item was not replaced and the part was not properly installed. I called the service department to see if it was covered under the recall item."

My strut and my tie rod is not working right I reported it two days after and John z said nothing was wrong. 6 months later now I have to hold my car steering wheel from the car veering off the road when I hit a bump from the car veering off the road. This was a pre owned certified car that was advertised that was not in an accident. If they did the 180 point inspection it would have been rejected due to damages on the car and I would not be in the situation with my car upside down and now they are trying to bleed me for another car with a higher price on another car! After buying a couple cars from this organization. This will be the last time. Thanks Jason from turning me from a happy customer to a browser.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"*** The good (or at least I think so)
- You can have a $70+ service (as advertised) for $35 from Groupon
*** The bad (from what I received)
- They literally dont know how to put the tires back on. I am serious! After a tire rotation, my car was shaking and I could not even make proper turn on to White Bridge Pike. I had to immediately stop in the middle of traffic with emergency lights on, then slowly crawled back to their station to have them check the wheel. It turned out that they did not tighten my front wheels properly.
- They destroyed my rear wheels' lug nuts. Somehow I did not notice that until the next tire rotation.

After this incident, you can pretty sure that I will never come back to this station again. I just discovered that Jiffy Lube has been sued for some frauds in car maintenance service (they dont do the jobs that they are supposed to do.) Just FYI. Do your own research and you will see a bunch of articles about this."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I've never had a problem with the service I get on my truck until I had the breaks done! I spent over $900 on pads, rotors and labor. picked truck up on a Friday and noticed a smell coming from the breaks. I just assumed it was the new pads breaking in. the next day we headed out for a weekend trip and got maybe 4 miles before the right rear caliper seized and damn near caught the breaks on fire, smoke everywhere from that that tire! took it back to dealership and waited there for over 3hrs while they checked for the problem. They told me that the tech forgot to lube the caliber when he did the brake job and it failed. They gave me a loner for our weekend trip, which was the only good thing about the service. when we get home on Monday we were told we needed to pay another $330 for a new caliper! needless to say I'm  pissed! I think I'll be getting service somewhere else from now on!!!!"

Not the greatest service, I will say their wash is great, my car gets cleaned well excluding wheel wells and a few other but try way too hard to get business rolling.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"My husband had the unfortunate event of having to have his car towed to this place after a flat tire.  The mechanic were nice and treated him with respect but what was suppose to be a $300 job for two new tires became an $1,011 job for what I thought were both back & front brakes & 2 tires.  To be fair we had asked to check the brakes since we had some noises coming from the brakes and we got a call from the mechanic saying ""as a courtesy they looked at our brakes (huh...we asked for them to look at them) at the time he said the brakes were worn etc. and quoted both my husband and I around $757 w/ tires and brakes being done, my husband lost a day of work and came home w/ only front tires and front brake done only BTW screeching noise is still there, so I am totally upset because we are NOT well off and this was a huge blow to us, can never go back."

Automotive,4.5,OR,"If the rating were for customer service alone. They would get six stars. They are extremely personable and polite. They offer to pick you up and drop you off while your car is being serviced instead of having you wait.

But...(and there is a but) you should definitely call around because their prices weren't competitive. I called this place 1st, the dealership 2nd and Pep Boys 3rd. Out of the three, Pep Boys gave me a lower price (by about $40 to get the rear brakes and rotors replaced on my Jeep). 

Also, after reading the glowing reviews I had hoped they'd be able to diagnose the issue I was having with my car. Sadly, after three visits, they couldn't. Conveniently they managed to discover $700 worth of other issues, none of which addressed the original problem. 

I understand that mechanics are like doctors. They can diagnose when given the symptoms but that doesn't mean they'll find the issue. But I was still a little disappointed with the results or lack thereof. Guess I'll just have to remain a cynic."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My husband purchased a new civic nine months ago from Crown and I went shopping for a used vehicle from them. I found something I liked and made the deal and signed the papers on a 2016 Hyundai. When the vehicle was turned over to me, i was handed one set of keys. I asked about the second set and was told that the previous owner promised to bring them in but never did. I expressed my dissatisfaction but received no resolve and it was late on a Saturday evening. I had to bring the car back for a known repair two days later and spoke to the salesman again. Again no resolve. I talked to the sales manager over the phone and he told me ""used cars only get one set"".  It will cost me $350 to get a second key. I feel I should have been told about this before I signed papers, as I feel it should've been negotiated into the purchase price. After all I spent $50,000 at this dealership within the past year."
Automotive,3.0,OR,If I could give them a less then 1 star I would the best thing I can say about this place is buyer beware!!!  My grandmother took her vehicle in for repairs picked it up and got down the block only to have the car die on her.  She called the shop and they told her she was told they would pay for her towing back to the shop.  When she went to pick up her car they told her she could not have he car until she paid for the towing because it wasn't their fault  and on he bill it says customer approved estimate.  No she didn't they held  car hostage until she paid them.  They held a 90 yr old woman's car hostage charging her for something they said they were covering a repair they should have caught when it was in the first time and didn't have the decency to answer her letter when she wrote them.  Big thumbs down and we will be contacting the BBB.
Automotive,1.0,OR,"Hostile, unbelievably uncommunicative delivery people. Reading other people's reviews, it does seem as if the delivery people are LOOKING for reasons not to complete the delivery or to do anything but simply leave the appliance inside the house and drive away. Because they refused to  answer ANY questions from me about installation or talk to my husband on the phone and would only say ""Did you take the measurements?"", I realized that I was very likely to end up with my old, but still working refrigerator removed and an expensive new one not connected, so when the hostile guy who was in charge said, ""I don't know if I want to come into the house with a situation like this"" (me, a small statured older woman arguing with small statured young son who WANTED them to come in with the new fridge and was talking over me), I said, ""Fine, I don't want you to deliver it"".  They were gone in a flash.  Don't order appliances from Home Depot (Sarasota, Florida) if Ralph's Transfer is involved."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"On the whole, outstanding - best dealership experience I've ever had. Phone is better than email, to be sure, but more importantly,. once I was on site, they got into high gear. Helpful, organized, responsive, and very nice and considerate. Staff seems to get along with each other and cooperate well together. It was nice and rare to hear no whispered trash-talking of customers or coworkers. Thoughtful and decent disclaimer-laden advice. (Matched stuff that I learned the hard way over the years. )


Admittedly, the circumstances were in my favour (dealerships would love to have lightly-used inventory, my financial situation is  mighty decent; leasing conditions are win-win for me. ). they gave me a very attractive trade-in value. If you're in a similar situation (trading in for a new vehicle and not in need of a miracle in terms of payment numbers), I'd highly recommend that you go for it. RIGHT now, while the ""used car inventory"" is in the situation that it's in. This dealership is great. Well-oiled machine on a lot of things."

I was told that I was going to have to sign a contract with the finance manager.  I agreed to the terms of the contract and it was on my way.  I was not pleased with the way the finance manager handled the situation.  I was very upset about the way I was treated and I was told that I would have to wait a week for my paperwork.

We were on a road trip from New York and our car got stuck in the middle of the road. We called AAA and they were able to get us a tow truck and get us on our way.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"All AutoZones sell the same things; the difference is all about the people working there.

At this particular AutoZone, the employees seem to prioritize dealing with customers below pretty much everything else.

Tidying light bulb displays?  More important than dealing with customers.  Clanking around in the back?  Ahead of customers.  Staring at a screen and clicking around?  Much more important. 

I don't need my butt kissed, but more often than not here, I find myself standing and waiting, watching two or more employees doing something else, while *nobody* mans the counter.  More than once, I've given up and gone somewhere else.  

Maybe there are some excellent people who work here and who aren't like this at all; but they've never been on duty when I've attempted to do business here over the course of several years.

The location is convenient for me, or I wouldn't bother trying this place at all -- plus I hold out hope that the staff or management might some day turn over to some people who care just a little bit."

I used to love them for tires.
Needed brakes to pass inspection and they gave me a quote to replace them.  
I trusted them so I went with the price.
So I go to pick up my car the next day and they proceeded to charge me $200 more than that but could give me NO REASON as to why.  
I told them I would pay the quote only - but they said it is either pay full amt. or they keep my car.  Said I could call back the next day for an explanation from the mechanic.  
Called back 4 different days and the mechanic was either out or not able to come to the phone and frankly I think they just made up the part about calling back . 
And I'm someone they actually knew by name since I would take my car in as well as the cars of several other friends and/or clients.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"DO NOT GO HERE! This car wash does not even deserve a single star. I bought my car two days ago, BRAND NEW, and it rained the first two days I had it. I drove it through their express wash (where you sit in the car while it's being washed) and when I got out of the car to look at the wash, there was a large scratch with chips in my paint. The scratch clearly looks like it was made by something automated like the washer's metal rod had gotten too close to my car and rolled across the paint. 
The general manager, Edgar Lamadrid came out to speak with me and had pretty much made up his mind before I even opened my mouth that this was not the car wash's fault nor their responsibility. He they would file a claim but that his higher ups would agree with him that they would not take responsibility for the scratch. If you don't want your car damaged with no one to take responsibility, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR WASH."

They are an absolute joke and they don't even deserve a star! 
I called them the next day, they told me the car was in great shape and that it was ready to go in a few days. I told them I was still waiting on the car and was told they could look at it and make sure everything was fine with the car. After a couple days I had to leave a message and call them again. They told me I had to come back to them again for a refund, but I was told they would call me back. I went back and they said they would call me back. I waited another two weeks. No call. I finally got a call back from the same guy and said he was going to call me back. He said he would call me back. I called back and he never did."

He has great customer service skills and will tell you what can wait for you. He will always give you a price before it goes into his shop. I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for honest, competent mechanics. I had a great experience with Jim Click Volkswagen. I was treated with respect and a smile. I had a check engine light on my car and they helped me with my service. I had an appointment for 3 pm and they were able to diagnose the issue and get me back on the road."

I went in to get an oil change and the guy at the desk said ""Oh yeah, I can't change it today"" and said ""well, they can't change it today"" and I should have just left before they closed.  I also mentioned the fact that they are a dealership and they will make you sign a new contract to honor it!  

I feel like I'm being treated like I'm a number, and I will never come back to this dealership!  This place is a joke and a waste of time and money.  I can't imagine how much they'll be taking care of my business, especially when I'm in the market for a new car.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"It's rare I give 5 stars to anything on Yelp, but these people were great. Had a large scrape on front bumper on 5 BMW. Since it's a lease I figured I was better off having someone fix it rather than BMW when I turned it in. Got 3 quotes and liked the fact that Otts could have my car back in a day and half, other places wanted ""at least"" 3 days to take the bumper off, etc.
Donna said they could do my car in a day and a half, so I dropped it off on a Sunday night.
Monday around 4 PM Donna called and said the car was done. The bill was very close to the estimate, but they not only fixed the scrape on the bumper, but took car of a few other area's for me. When I got the car back, they had washed it and cleaned the inside.

Last week, my engine blew in Hoover, AL on the way back from Florida, and the repair shop I found there told me it would be $7000 to replace the engine.  I called up Steve and said, ""Hey man, I know this doesn't help you at all, but I'm just looking for advice.""  He told me to let him see what he could find out. 
Within 30 minutes, he had located an engine at a salvage shop in Indianapolis with only 23k miles for $2300 plus $250 shipping, and a different auto repair shop in Hoover who quoted the job at $1000-$1500, for a total repair of about $4000.
He saved me $3000, with nothing to gain, except for the appreciation of his customer, and he sure has that!

Automotive,3.5,OR,"It is always nice when you decide to make a switch from a trusted provider and your ""new one"" makes you wonder why you didn't switch sooner.  I have been travelling upwards of 30 weeks a year for 15 years and have been parking down the street for that whole time.  They recently raised their prices and their service went downhill so I decided to switch to Colonial.

For roughly the same price as the ""discount"" at the other place, I can get my car valet parked at Colonial.  When you call for your shuttle, you give them your car number and it is waiting for you under cover with snow cleared and heat on when you arrive at the lot.

Shuttles are frequent - I wouldn't say the drivers are friendly but they are efficient.  

Self parking is also available. AAA discounts and a frequent parker club allow for other discounts.  They will even wash and service your car for you while you are out of town.

Colonial parking is a great choice when you need airport parking."

I live close to Valvoline so I walked there to see if I could get a new battery.  The staff member that assisted me found that they didn't have the particular battery I needed in stock, so he offered to drive me back to my apartment and jump start my truck so that I could get to work.

First visit- I dropped by to get my tires checked and an oil change. The guys there were incredibly friendly and made me feel very welcome. Donald topped off my fluids in addition to everything else, and the price was pretty cheap. I was in and out in 15 minutes!

Second visit- My ABS light was on and I had concerns about a noise in the back of my car. My previous mechanic had used this noise as an excuse to keep encouraging me to replace parts. Donald took one look at my car, told me it was rust and to turn my radio up. He checked my brakes, said they were fine, and working on the ABS would be too expensive and unnecessary. He didn't charge for any of this and it took 5-10 minutes.

Very disappointed In The service and care that was done. Frankly you would think that you would expect more from a business or even the common personal element I have been here before when I have heard them talking bad about customers or making sly remarks and I just let it pass it's now evident that it's more of a culture thing and I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere for your services.

But, to their disappointment it was not running right, it would barely go 5 MPH. They took it back within 3 minutes and told them something was wrong. Little did they know that something had been done wrong with the electronics when they removed them to replace the fender. It has been a big fight now to get them to fix it.

A few months later (less than four months) when I went to enquire about leasing a new car and trading in the one they sold to me, they valued the car they sold me for 2,000!  The General Manager never replied to my email that thoughtfully listed my concerns and asked how we could resolve the issues. They also did every sneaky sales trick you're warned about. Leaving you in cubicle. Keeping your keys, making you wait for them, then giving you a YOU'LL STILL SAVE MONEY lower price (but not near the one they said they could get you during the first HOUR). Luckily they have a Peruzzi plate on my car and I'm decorating it with lemons! In my line of work I talk to many people a day and have been telling everyone to stay away from Peruzzi. They brag about their ""community service."" Most companies that are busy trying to look compassionate do so because they don't want people to realize they are no better than politicians."

She took My son-in-law's phone number out of the system and has been calling him and causing problems between him and my daughter and AutoZone doesn't do anything about this it's perfectly fine with them. Well we're going to the police with this I am going with my daughter I had enough of this woman and AutoZone not doing anything about it. Here I thought that a customer's privacy came first I thought a phone number from a customer was confidential I didn't know that any woman if that's what you want to call her can just get a customers information call them from the store or  from her house phone like it's wrong unethical unprofessional and that doesn't say too much for Auto Zone either as A Company To allow This to Happen.
Automotive,3.0,OR,"My experience with the Leaf has been awful. The car has a battery warranty which states when the car reaches 8 bars, they'll replace the battery. The software completely lies and Nissan does nothing but make excuses about it. The car is currently only storing 1/2 of the charge it once did. I kept telling them that how I drive the car is completely irrelevant to the loss of capacity and that the software is lying. It is not down to 80% charge, it's now under 50 and barely stores 10KW on a 24KW battery. All they did was connect it to their diagnostic computer and say everything is fine. I told them, LOOK at your own CARWINGS app and look at the number of kilowatts consumed from full charge to empty. the software is clearly lying. My warranty is only good till August of 2017. The tech told me not to worry it will reach 8 bars by then. Who cares! I can drive the car to downtown st pete and back 1 time and it's out of charge! The car is useless!"
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Affordable & quick to return.  

However, we got in our car just to be redirected at the rental exit, back to the rental booth due to the car needing servicing.  Many other customers in front of us had the same issue & were also redirected.

Yes, they upgraded us to a Kia Soul, but you'd think they'd know what cars need servicing before you load up all your luggage just to unload & load back into another car.  The lady at the booth said 'well hopefully this one doesn't need servicing.'  Thankfully it didn't or we would've had to keep unloading & going in circles til we found a car.  They can't check that at the booth, only when you get into the car & drive it to the exit.  Many people were doing the same as us. Unreal.

Two more things, the guy at the Dollar Desk inside TPA was rude, but quick getting us on our way thankfully.  And on the receipt it says if you don't return it full they charge $9.99 a gallon!  Whoa!"

Later that day we were called by a receptionist saying our vehicle was ready to pick up. No service representative discussed with us what was done to the car. We were not charged anything and were told that an invoice would be mailed. We thought that was very strange. Several days later, still no invoice/description of services in the mail.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"They think they're the kings of your car, and will ticket or tow on a whim, for nothing. Perhaps they should be renamed the Philadelphia Carking Authority.

Some of the worst parking agents in the whole country on a level with Boston and New York City - but at least in New York City you can understand, as it's the busiest and touristiest and perhaps best city and everyone wants to be there, so they're going to make money out of it and often in disgusting ways, but Boston should know better and should do better, and damn, Philadelphia has the least excuse of all and it's one of the worst, with high fines and pretty much no chance of overturning the tickets. They give them on a whim and often for no posted reason. They're always lurking and it gets ugly.

Yet Philly isn't close to being on the tourist level of the other North East cities, and If they want people to come to Philadelphia and they wanted to be touristy like Boston and DC and New York, they need to do much much better."

I called and spoke with Daisy, after explaining the issue I was having with my vehicle( drivers side headlight and blinkers weren't working) she told me no appointment was needed and it was $149. 95 to diagnose which some of the money would go toward the repair of the car. I later took my vehicle to this awful place and was told, appointment was needed and it would take a minimum of 4 hours just to diagnose said problem. Even after explaining what I was quoted I over the phone, the guy in service gave me every reason he could because I believe he just didn't want to do his job and told me to take it to another mechanic. I went to Shums in the Mayfair, he looked at the vehicle and within one hr he had the entire problem fixed. Water was getting in the headlight housing causing it to short out. And to think, Hesserts was trying to charge me $600 just to diagnose. Absolutely ridiculous, stay away from this dealership."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I have been here a few times for minor services. Each time I received an oil change, when I return home I have noticed oil drippings in my garage .

I have stains in my garage from this and I have to clean up the mess properly myself.After this last visit I wanted to see what the inspection report would show as I know I needed a few things .

As expected, the insepction showed nothing. Everything was perfect on the sheet. 

What actually was needed were as follows:

My air filter needed replacing , my tires needed replacing ( the RR was 6 pounds low because of a nail) , windshield wipers needed replacing and the transmission fluid was dirty .  Lastly, the oil change took 1:15 minutes and the price was different then the last oil change .

The buying experience was fantastic.  The experience was excellent.  The sales people were knowledgeable and helpful.  I was able to get a good deal on the car I was looking for.  I was able to get the car I wanted and they even let me test drive it for me.  I couldn't be happier with my new car.  They also worked with me to get a great deal on the car.  I would recommend Lithia Hyundai of Reno to anyone looking for a new car.I'm new to the area and went here to get my smog checked. I was in and out in about 15 minutes. I didn't have to wait long but they had a coupon for a free smog check

After I decided on a car I was interested in, I was also interested in a used car. I also mentioned the car I was interested in was priced at $200,000. I was told it was on the lot and that I would have to drive it to the dealership for a test drive. I said no and went to the dealership. The sales manager (I assume) said he was doing his best to make it right. I asked him if he could give me the price I wanted and he said no. I had an hour and a half to work with him. I was going to buy the car and drive it to the dealership."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"We enjoyed our car buying experience. The dealership is a class act. We have a 2012 Tahoe. The sales people are nice, but the service department is not the same as most dealers. They are not transparent with the customer. If you are going to purchase a new vehicle, you should take your business elsewhere. I would recommend going elsewhere. I had to wait 3 months for a part to come in to install a part that was on my order. It's been 3 weeks and it still hasn't come in. I have called multiple times and they haven't returned my calls. I will be taking my business elsewhere. Do not buy a car from this dealership. We bought a car from them and it was a nightmare. We went in to look at a car and it was a very low mileage car. We went to look at a vehicle we saw online and we had no idea what we were talking about."

I was referred to Nasim's by my good friend who has been going to him for years. I got my brakes done for a great price, he gave me a great key ring when they were done( and I needed it) as well as vacuumed my car and offered me food while i waited. I came back for damage due to collision, perfect experience! Came back a third time with some bad luck, someone broke my side mirror, got a quote the very same day and it was just beyond the price of my deductible, not only did he fix it, do my inspection and my brakes, and make my car look gorgeous inside and out with a nice wash but he saved me hundreds of dollars. I literally could not stop referring him after that. Located on a quiet street in the North Philadelphia area closed to everything in the city, I will never go anywhere else for a repair."

I keep responding that NO I'm not happy and will NOT recommend them and why and I never get a response from anyone. They take your money and then forget you all together. They lied and said everything was ready on my new RV and when I get it it has a dead battery, no lifts on the bed for the storage compartment, scratches on the outside that no one will do anything about. No sewer hose or water hoses, this is brand new $25,000 and it doesn't come with it?? It has been a real nightmare and will tell everyone not to go to La Mesa RV! They have big sales and advertise on TV all the time because people are finding out that they are no good and going somewhere else. Wish we had of!"

Water bottles stuffed under the seat - ???  And the car was left unlocked on their lot for after hours pickup.  They don't return phone calls, either.  If you call them, though, they answer and ask you ""Volvo, or luxury?""   These people are not at all representing their brand.   It was never like this when Mr Waltrip owned the dealership - only since Carlock took over.  I get better service at the Ford dealer for my farm truck. 
Update:  Thanks to Jason McCoy, Sales Manager, for stepping in to improve our experience.  He made arrangements for the rim repair guys to be onsite this week and provided a loaner.  And he's committed to working with their team to improve the service experience and remains available to us.  Indeed, it's about the relationships, not transactions, and he gets it."

When I arrived at the airport, I was told that there was no shuttle service available and that they had no vans available. I asked if they had any other shuttle service available, but he said no. I asked why the shuttle was coming and he said that he thought that it was because it was too close to the airport. I was very disappointed that he told me that the shuttle service was not available.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I chose to take advantage of the ""Buy 3 get one free"" deal, and I was told the tires I selected were not available. They did, however find another set of tires for the same price, and told me that the rebate applied to them as well, so I went with their selection.

Long story short: The tires they said were available for the ""buy 3 get 1 free"" deal were, in fact, not eligible for a rebate, and I waited 8 weeks, and never saw a dime. I received a letter in the mail telling me no rebate would be given. Was this deceit intentional? I would be naive to think it was not.

I also asked them to check a number of things that they never checked, and the service was overall very shoddy. They refused to even run a diagnostics check for my vehicle. The attendants were unhelpful, and they seemed to be college-aged kids who were generally unsocialized, and very sarcastic. I can't blame it on them, though--it comes from upbringing--their parents are probably idiots too. I won't be giving these guys any more service."

You'll be saving money by transferring too."" Well, I received a new plate by AZ DMV in the mail yesterday and I was livid. Unless you are on top of them every step of the way, they will screw things up. I have given them almost $80k in business in less than 2 years and they managed to make me lose all confidence in them. I will never be purchasing a new vehicle from Desert Toyota again. I also noticed that my new plate/registration cost me over $700. So much for saving money. Unless you have the time and energy to babysit everyone at Desert to be sure they are doing everything correctly, I encourage you to go elsewhere for your purchase."

I like their service here, they are usually nice.
What made me change my mind was recently when I went in to get an oil change 2 hours before their closing time,  they were booked and couldn't help me that day, they had appointments on friday, I went on a wednesday.
I understand this process, they are busy. I just won't go back because since I was traveling out of town and needed an oil change, I had to go somewhere else.
Turns out the other place is a LOT cheaper (same oil brand) without having to cut a coupon, has my car ready within 40 minutes at the latest and overall a great place. I'd still recommend brakemax, as long as you are prepared to wait up to 2 hours or not be seen at all if doing a walk-in."

I went back to the mechanic and told them I had a coupon for a $10 off coupon for an oil change. They said it was $10 off. So I asked why it wasn't included in the price. They said that I should have told them I was going to go home to pick up my car. I was told that they had to put the coupon on my car. I asked why. The guy said it's not their policy to give a coupon."

We were told that the car had only one key and that the car needed to be serviced.  We were assured that the car was okay and that it would not be serviced.  The service manager assured us that the car was not in the same condition.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"Let me start off saying I've had a lot of bad luck with my car in the past couple months. First I was told I needed $4,200 in repairs from a dealership (my first mistake was taking it to a dealership) for something that wasn't even broken. Next, my luck turned for the worst when my car was accidentally ran into a curb. I was out of town and got enough fixed to get me home. After I got home and ran it through insurance and I was expecting to make another $1,000 in repairs. I did some research and called up John Stricker Auto Repair and that's when my luck turned around. I dropped off my car Sunday night and by Monday afternoon I got a call from Tony who said I didn't have any repairs needed on my car. He went through all the paperwork with me explaining why and what was going on. It was such a relief to not be jerked around and fooled into spending thousands in unnecessary repairs. John Stricker's has my business because they are a honest company with honest people."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"So, I was looking for a place to get my car detailed. Of course, I never really want to go just anywhere so I tried here. Such a great decision. My car looks great! I think one thing that really stuck out was the honesty though. Previously, I had work done on my car because of scratches. I was nervous because I wasn't sure if people could tell (I mean I do have a nicer car). To me, my friends, and family everything looked fine. After I came to pick up my car they had explained that the job did on my car was noticeable (to a trained eye). They got me on the phone with someone who would be able to get my car right. It was really sweet and above and beyond me just getting my car detailed. If you need a place to go, this is the spot. Super glad I stopped by because then I probably would have never realized the mistakes on my car and would most likely lose more money if I ever decided to get rid of it for something else."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Similar to other experiences, we made an appointment when the dealership opened to see an F 150 with a lady named Dallas.  She insisted that we ""ask for her"" when we arrived. She said it was a pretty truck and that she would call if there was any interest in it before we arrived.  We drove over an hour to the dealership and when we got there we were introduced to her and immediately handed over to another gentleman who then informed us, once we were walked out on to the lot, that it sold. With a bitter taste in our mouths we still decided to look around since we had already made the trip. Found a truck that was at least worth a test drive and received nothing less than the TRUE USED CAR SALESMAN experience. Save yourself the time and hassle, go somewhere, anywhere else. Any 'Sales Manager', we had the displeasure of working with Pat, who says ""Well, I don't know what my bottom dollar is"", isn't worth your business.

In a desperate search to get as far from Lakeside Toyota as possible, I found CARS and here's why CARS rocks!  1) I got sick of the dealer ripping me off  2) All the mechanics at CARS used to work at the Toyota/Lexus dealer, so they know foreign cars!  3) The front counter is staffed by the nicest ladies in the auto repair biz who give you the straight dope.  They arn't going to charge you hundreds of dollars to replace a filter or fill up your fluids.  This place is hands down the best Auto service shop in the New Orleans area.  The only down side is they are sometimes super busy and you gotta call ahead to get an appt, but this is actual nice because when you do come in, they give you one-on-one attention.  Watch out for the construction on causeway.  CARS is right next to Whole Foods which is a plus."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I bought 2 tires in October 8,  2019 and was told if I come back and buy the other 2 within 30 days,  I could get free road hazard on all 4 tires.  Ihad to take the car back 3 days later because the sensor in my tire was not installed properly and was making a horrible noise.  10 days later,  October 18, 2019 I went back to buy the other 2 tires.  Road hazard was added to 2 of the tires.  Now I have a damaged tire and GO FIGURE,  it's NOT one of the tires with road hazard.  The receipt shows the salesperson name,  to who the person i spoke with today has never heard of... the receipt also shows the road hazard was free,  why would they give me free road hazard on 2 tires? I live 64 miles away from the nearest location and I'm being told to do it off... no appointment can be given, they will fit me in whenever they can. I can get this type of service from Walmart..."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Their building is super clean, and has free coffee and tea.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a woman and have a couple of great things to say about this shop. It's a little pricey for a car but I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off.

I'm also a military veteran and had to wait a little longer than I was originally told to and they were pretty quick. However, I think I'll give them another try if I get my oil changed.I've been using these guys for a long time.  They are always honest and reliable.  They've never tried to up sell me on anything I don't need.  They're always willing to take the time to explain what's wrong with my car and what they're doing.  They are really nice people and I never feel like they're trying to up sell me anything I don't need."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"Not very impressed with this dealership. The dealership is a joke. The sales team is a joke. I went to get a car, and was told it was ready. When I arrived, the salesman was on his phone. I told him I had not been there. He said he was going to get the keys to the car. I asked if they could get the key, and he said ""no, they don't have a key"". I said, ""no, I don't have a key, I'll get it. "" I said, ""no, I don't have a key, so I'll be in today"". He said, ""it's next door"". I said, ""no, we'll close at 9:30, I'll be in today. "" 

The next day, I get a call from the finance manager, and he says that the car was sold."

The woman at the front desk told me that I needed to take it to the dealership to get it checked out.  I was told that I needed to take it to the dealership and get it checked out.  I also mentioned that I had a Groupon for an oil change and was told that I could not do it for that price because it was a Groupon.  I told them that I needed the oil change, and they said that it was not a Groupon and that it was a Groupon.  I asked why the Groupon was not included in the Groupon price and was told that the Groupon is not included in the Groupon price.  I was told that the Groupon is for an oil change and tire rotation.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! I got in and out and the guys working we're very pleasant which is really all that was good about the place. I went in for 2 used tires and one popped a week later on the highway so I had to go buy new ones anyways. I got the tires to avoid that situation and luckily my husband was driving and was able to avoid us crashing while going 80 MPH. I had also brought in my own hubcaps I got for $50 on amazon trying to save a buck and asked if they knew how to put them on. They said they would do it no problem and seemed so nice about it so I let them do it. I live 2 miles away and all 4 hubcaps had flown off by the time I got home. What a joke. I won't be going back. I don't think they know what is an acceptable used tire to sell someone and what isn't. Also if your job is cars, you should know how to properly fit a hubcap. Waste of my time and money."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"5 stars for a cell phone parking lot? YES! If you have to wait, make it a sweet place to lounge and the Tampa Airport folks thought of all sorts of fabulous things to make the stay awesome. First? Free wifi - nuff said. They offer holiday music on a radio station you can only hear within those lots. Tune in or not which is much better than constant streaming music over loudspeakers. Personal choice! Not sure what they offer on that radio station outside of the holiday season. Will update my review if I go back there.

The restrooms are clean, well-stocked, and surrounded by Florida landscaping that welcomes you into the paved courtyard. There are vending machines offering beverages and snacks at typical prices. So, if a flight is delayed and you're getting hangry, you can get something to make the wait less annoying.

The separate display panels are easily visible from a variety of parking locations (I moved my car and checked).  The only downside is the entrance/exit but that backup might be improved once construction is completed. Again, I'll update my review if I go back."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Thank you to Tony & Brett for the wonderful customer service when my headlight was out on a rainy, foggy night!
It was Sat. Jan. 3, and I was the designated driver for my husband & his friends. Minutes after dropping them off in Kennett Square, an alert popped up stating that one of my low beam lights was out. Not really wanting to wait until morning due to the poor weather conditions, I called Pep Boys on Concord Pike almost at closing time. He was so friendly & helpful, assuring me that he would take care of it for me and not to worry. My light was fixed promptly  by a very skillful technician Brett, who had me on the road within minutes. Tony provided such wonderful customer service & both of them absolutely went out of their way to fit me in at a late hour & I got my hubby & his friends safely home in atrocious weather. Thank you so much---I have told my friends about this & will continue to promote this business!!! It's the little things in life that make the most impact."

The finance manager, Bob, was also very nice and professional.  I highly recommend this dealership.  I will definitely buy another car from them and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new car.  I would highly recommend them.I had a great experience with AutoNation Nissan.

Automotive,4.5,CG,I called earlier this week and asked if they could do a full safety inspection for the vehicle and they said yes. The technician then said they could do a complete safety inspection and it would be ready within 2 days. I was very pleased with the service and the price. I had a 2 day appointment and the vehicle was ready the same day. I was also impressed with the overall service. I highly recommend this business. I will be back for future service. Thank you again for all your hard work. I recently moved to Philadelphia from California and had a great experience here. They were friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend them. I had a flat tire and AAA recommended this place. I've been going to this location for years and it's been great. They're the best. They're quick and efficient. They're not trying to sell me anything I don't need.

They told me it would be a couple hours. I told him I was waiting and that I had a 2pm appointment. I told him I had to wait on my car so I could get there. He had to ask me to go to the manager because he couldn't get the manager to come out to speak with me. I had to leave my car for about an hour and he never called me back. They were like that's okay, it's not my fault. I had to wait for them to take my car to my mechanic for an oil change. I was told it would take a while and they would have to keep my car overnight for another day. I waited for over an hour before someone finally came out to take my car"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"The worst car wash I have EVER received. I've been going here for years and recently they have made changes and it's HORRIBLE. For $40 you expect a clean car however when getting back into the car I noticed the only thing that seemed to be cleaned was the exterior and dash. First, the dash was smeared with a lotion looking substance that was not even fully rubbed in. Nothing else in the car was cleaned. When we asked why they didn't do more they said you have to pay $70 range now for more than the dash. WHAT?! I live in Miami now, one of the most expensive cities in Florida, pay $20 for a car wash and it's spotless. We asked for a manger who said ""we get so many dirty cars we can't make money if we don't charge for each place to get wiped down. "" HELLO YOURE A CAR WASH. So if you do go hear just know you're over paying for a drive through car wash you could get at a gas station and a wipe down of your dash and steering wheel."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Excuse my language, but this business is a piece of shit. We made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for a truck and a tow dolly for an out of state move. We received the truck and were told that there were no dollys within a 200 mile radius and to come back in a few hours. We had no home to go to, all of our belongings were packed, and we had a 9 hour drive ahead of us. We loaded up the truck, came back, and they still didn't have anything. We then made a reservation with U-Haul and asked Budget to pay for the trailer since they failed to fulfill their end of the reservation, to which they responded ""a reservation is not a contract"". We ended up paying $500 more than we had planned just to tow our car to Utah. When I tried calling to complain the manager completely lied about what he told my husband during the entire process. As I said, this business is a piece of shit. The ratings on here say plenty about their service. Do not rent from this location."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"They do an overall good job. Its a nice and quick car wash, but I've been noticing lately their guys are rushing to get the cars through as quickly as possible. I understand, its a small business, and you have to turn cars to make money, but that speed is coming at the cost of quality. 

We took my moms truck their the other day to get it washed as she is getting ready to sell it. She pointed out some spots that had been missed, to which, the owner came out and cleaned those spots. My mom pointed some items out that you could not expect to be removed easily by a quick car wash. It would require some definite elbow grease. Unfortunately, when we got home she began pointing out numerous areas where they'd missed, including major parts of the tires, where the tire dressing hadn't even been wiped onto the tires. 

Overall though, would I still take my car here, yes. It's local, I like the people that work there, and I like to support small business. Would I come out expecting a super nice wash, meh..."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"These guys still rock. I've continued to get my regular car maintenance here, and I've had a couple weird problems come up (broken door actuator and two tires with faulty seal thingies) that they've taken care of as well. Ted is always so helpful and willing to explain any repairs or car physiology to me.

What I love most about them, though, is the customer service. I only stop by about once every six months, but they still know me by name and face. Cheryl, the office manager, is always courteous and happy to help. They're willing to drop you back off at your house. One time, in fact, they closed down the shop and actually drove my car back to my house after it was serviced so that I didn't have to come pick it up. Just recently they hosted a give-back-to-the-community event that involved an outdoor movie screening, bonfire, food trucks, and partnerships with local vendors.

Really, I just can't get enough of these guys. I love how close they are to my house, but it's just icing on the cake that they provide such excellent work and customer service."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Super happy with my service. I'd recommend this location to anyone who needs a full service car wash. And I also get the $20 wash. The customer service is great. I can't imagine going anywhere else. Great service!  They found the problem within the hour and fixed the problem right on the spot. They are very friendly and honest!  I will definitely go back for any future needs!I had a great experience with this company. I worked with Joe, he was very helpful and made the process easy. He went above and beyond. I would recommend him to anyone in the market for a new or used car. I have been to a few different car washes in the area and I have had a great experience with this one. I have never been disappointed with the service. I paid for the premium wash which includes the interior and exterior wash."
Automotive,1.0,CG,"I was recently visiting my daughter in the market for a new car. I called the dealership and spoke with two salesmen and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The sales man was extremely knowledgeable and helped us find a vehicle that was the perfect fit for our needs. I highly recommend this dealership for your next vehicle purchase. I have never had such a great experience at a car dealership. I came in to look at a couple of cars and a few other cars. The salesman was friendly, helpful and made sure I was comfortable with my decision. I was able to buy a vehicle online and get a good price on the vehicle. I also found that the price on the car I was interested in was a bit higher than the advertised price. The salesman I spoke with was nice and helpful and went out of his way to make sure I was happy. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a car."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"Fact:  I normally won't go to the dealership, but I saw a lot of people here and decided to try them out. I am a bit hesitant to go to a place that does not try to upsell me. I am very pleased with the service and the people there. I had a problem with my car and they fixed it free of charge. I will definitely be returning here for my next service!This place is great! The customer service is top notch and the price is pretty reasonable! I've been going here for almost 4 years and I've never had a problem. They are always honest and upfront with you and they don't try to sell you something you don't need. I've never had a problem. I've gone to other places to get my oil changed and they've never charged me anything. I've used this place for a few years and I'll continue to come here for any car needs."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"So I'm not too sure about everyone else's experiences, but I am so thankful for 24 Hour Auto & Tire Repair. I went to a friends house and as I got back into my car, I realized there was a deep puncture in my front left tire. I couldn't see a physical nail or anything but I knew the major drop in PSI was not a good sign. 

This shop is cash only but they can plug your tire (if that's the only issue) for $15. Take a $20 bill and tip $5 and you've saved yourself some major cash. This spot was a three minute drive from my friends house and I was able to take my car without an appointment or anything.

The gentleman who helped me out was very communicative and told me the process. I had to rotate my tire and keep it sticking out so they could detect any air bubbles. Once he located it, it took him another ten minutes to plug it in.

I'll definitely be coming back if there is ever another issue like this. Great customer service. No frills and straight to the point."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"BEWARE- they don't care and will take your money and run 
Bought a 2016 Dodge Van in Feb 2019- HORRIBLE decision on my end. In was in the dealership 11 times from 2/2019 to 1/2020. The door was stuck, trunk didn't work, recall- which was fine. BUT 5 of those times it was for the SAME part. Would have been fine with it but the part controlled my brakes. I would lose control and wouldn't be able to stop the van. Kept bringing it in, kept getting it fixed, kept talking to the man who sold me the van and the repair people. I was told ""you have a wonderful warranty so just keep getting it fixed"". Last day I had the van, I lost control and almost killed my son and I. I even let the dealership know and no one said a thing. These people do NOT
 CARE, HAVE NO SYMPATHY AND ARE NOT
TRUSTWORTHY. WOULD NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN!!!! 
Ps was also told I paid 2020 price on a 2016 van 
They are con artists. 
SO UPSET AND WAISTED MY MONEY WITH NO ONE CARING OR HELPING"
Automotive,3.5,OR,I have never been treated so badly in my life. I went to Tires plus for an alignment on my 2005 Corvette thats wearing the inside of the front tires. I explained I was an alignment mechanic for 15 years and wanted to see the reading before they adjusted it. They agreed. The camber was negative .5 degrees on both sides which was causing the inside  wear. The told me they would adjust the camber. When the car was done I asked to see the printout. The camber was still negative .5 degrees. I told him I was unhappy and didn't want to pay for nothing. I was going to buy a lifetime alignment ($200) but I said they didn't adjust the camber. They actually didn't adjust much of anything. I continued to say I was not going to pay for it and wanted the district managers phone info.  He then told me to get the F$%K out of this store and don't come back. Nice. All they do is Toe and go wont do an accurate alignment. And they want you to buy tires. Run the other way!

I had an oil change done here, and they said the oil pan had a leak and that it needed to be replaced.  I was told it would be $300 to replace the pan.  I said no, I will take it to the dealer and they would fix it.  They did.  I paid $200 for the pan.  I took it to another shop, and they said the pan had a leak, but the oil pan was not leaking, so I had to pay another $200 to fix the pan.  I went back to my car to get the pan replaced, and they told me I could get it fixed for $500.  I asked them to do the oil change, and they said they would have to put in a new pan.  I asked them to put the pan back on and they did. "

I highly recommend this dealership for any new car purchases.  They provided excellent service and a great experience.  I would highly recommend them for any future car purchases.I recently moved to the area and had a very difficult time finding a good mechanic in the area.  I stopped by this location to get a quote on some other work done to my car.  They were very honest and professional and I had no reservations.  They went above and beyond to find the issue and get my car in quickly.  They even gave me a ride to the shop in town.

If you want to get your car fixed right the first time, go see these guys. They are great.I have been a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. Today I was in the market for a new car and had to work with several people to get the deal done. I had to leave a lot of time on my mind and a lot of frustration. I was told that I had to come back because I had to get my car serviced. This was a huge inconvenience and I ended up leaving with a bad experience. They could have easily sold me a car that I didn't even want to drive. It was a hassle. I would have had a better experience with my salesperson, but I have no idea how long it would have been. I don't recommend this dealership to anyone. I will be sure to"
Automotive,2.0,CG,This place employs chauvinists and are not professional at all. I will never ever go back to this place. If you want to get your car fixed then this is the place to go. The only place I'll go to. I will never recommend them. This is my second time going here and I will not be going back. I'm not sure if they are the same as the first one.This place has been great for my family.  I have a 2012 Mazda 3 that they have taken care of for a very reasonable price.  I trust them with my cars and they have always been extremely honest with me.  They've never tried to up sell me on anything I don't need.  They're a huge asset to your company and they have a customer for life.  My parents have taken their cars here for years and I'm happy to say they are still there.I have been a loyal customer for over a decade.
Automotive,4.0,OR,"As a young blonde female, many automotive repair shops in the area have tried to rip me off. Unfortunately, this is one of those places. I came in for a smog check and Gaspar told me that I ""almost passed"" but needed to drive my car all the way to Goleta to test it out. After I returned about 25 minutes later, he told me with a chuckle that ""I had great timing because he was about to head home"" even though he promised to wait for me to come back . 

He failed my smog and charged me $45, telling me I can come back another time but he would charge a $25 retest fee...even though most other places offer free retests! 

I did not make any repairs on my vehicle (my check engine light is fickle and that is why Gaspar failed me) but it turned off on its own and I passed my smog at a different repair shop. I strongly recommend Pedro Smog on Salinas. Great service, I was in and out in 10 minutes without an appointment. I do not recommend getting ripped off at Gaspar's shop."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Sad to say that this business takes advantage of people. I've read reviews here about female patrons being sold services or new tires they don't need. Although I'm a guy, the weekend staff did not hesitate to gouge me since I had been brought in by a flat bed tow truck. For two tires on a 2013 Kia Soul, I was charged $231.90. The first quote they gave me was almost six hundred dollars for all four tires. I said that I would have to go with a cheaper tire and only get two since my emergency car repair fund was $250. Wouldn't you know it, the next price quoted was $253. I bought a 5 dollar coupon book to save about 20 bucks on the installation but still left feeling ripped off. When I told my co-workers, they agreed that I was taken advantage of. One co-worker drives a sports car (with the big wide tires) and he only paid $500 for all four of his tires at a different business. How can tires for a mini-suv, soccer-mom, hamster-mobile Kia cost the same as tires for a tricked out performance car?"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I'm really writing about the car rental portion of Reno Toyota because that's who I did business with.  If you're a frequent traveler and you don't seek out Toyota dealerships who rent cars, then shame on you.  Bryan Balvanz, the Rental Fleet Manager, deals straight up with me when I fly in from anywhere and need a car in the Reno/Tahoe area.  I own a Lincoln, but love Toyotas for the comfort and gas mileage.  Bryan is always courteous and fast to fill my rental car needs.  He is less than a mile from the Reno Airport so I don't pay hgh taxes and airport return fees.  I have a new Toyota of my choice with unlimited miles.  You can even travel out of state as long as you let them know.  This is my best kept travel secret and by sharing it, he may run out of cars!  I give them five stars because they deserve it.  I have no contact with the actual workings of the dealership as to shop or sales, just the rental area and they are awesome."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Had a large dent on rear quarter of a sedan, very hard spot to get to. He had to drill a hole in rear door frame to be able to reach behind the dent. (plugged it afterwards) The dent did not come out perfect, as there are tons of rough spots that could not be smoothed out due to metal being stretched. It looks like i have 20 little dents instead of one big one. Since my car is light gold/tan, it is hard to spot until you get close, within 20 feet or so. To be honest, i dont think its a 95% repair like he said. Probably more like 70 since it is extremely rough in the whole area where the dent was. Now I understand why no other paintless dent people would touch this dent. Just dont think it was worth $385 for how it ended up. For SMALLER dents, i would highly recommend. But for a larger dent, it was not worth it. Gave 3 stars because id reccomend and trust him for smaller dents. Photo doesnt show the dents left. But in person its easy to see."

They said it would cost me $100. 00 to replace the battery and I would have to replace it myself. I paid $100. 00 for the battery and $30. 00 for the battery and $50. 00 for the battery. I told them I was going to replace the battery and I was told that it would cost me $70. 00. I asked why they would charge me for the battery and was told ""I don't know.

I was able to get in touch with the manager, who had some concerns with me. He had me in and out in about 20 minutes and I was on my way. If I lived in Tucson I would definitely buy from them again. I was referred to Caliber Collision by a friend and I have been to many of the other auto body shops in the area. I was skeptical when I first saw this shop, but I thought I'd try it out. I was in a rush to get my car repaired, and I was given the opportunity to go over the repairs. My car was fixed in a timely manner and the work was done very quickly. I'm happy to say that Caliber Collision was very honest with me about the repairs needed and their prices."

The sales people were super helpful and very patient with me. I highly recommend going here.I've been here several times, never had a problem and the service is always fast and courteous. The only reason I gave them four stars is because I had to take my car to get looked at and I was told to come in at 5. My car was sitting in the shop for an hour before I was told my car was ready. They said it would be ready at 6pm. I dropped my car off"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Clearly if you're cruising through reviews of this place you're of the mindset that either they're going to light your car on fire and burn it in front of you or they'll hand feed you dates while your tires are rotated for free. I promise neither of things are likely to happen. 

It's a chain. They hire almost exclusively from the long list of high school drop outs who are just starting to really want to get their lives together and really want to please you and impress their boss. This turns them into helpless idiots following a book of non-sense that is pretty meaningless except when it impacts your day. 

Ultimately, I go here to replace tires. 

They do that pretty well at truly reasonable prices. I do not count on them to service my vehicle beyond the rubber that touches the road. This system works great as they're super good at putting tires on 99% of the time and even know what they're talking about when they say something tire related is happening. 

Since 99% of their time is tires, they might fall short a few other areas, especially making recommendations."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My car's engine light came on so I took it to a local auto zone to see if they could read the code for me, auto zone told me that my EGR Valve was the issue, so then I took my car to this shop to see if they could fix it, the guy in the Car Care Center office said they needed to lift the car & inspect it because they ""need specific details as to what might be wrong"" & they wouldn't take out, add a new part or work on my car at all UNTIL I approved of it. When the inspection was over, they called me and told me at the office pretty much the same thing that auto zone had told me which was that I needed to replace my EGR valve. Now that I knew what was wrong, I wanted to see if I could get some deals to replace it however the Car Care Center charged me $600 for pretty much nothing, not a single new car part was added. I paid the guy in full & left with my car's check engine light still on."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I have been coming to Reno Vulc to get all my cars serviced for over 20 years. Honest and professional just cracks the surface of how incredible this place is. Steve and the crew never rush you as you are explaining your concerns about your vehicle. They never try to "" up sale"" you on items you don't really need. They call you and advise you of any additional issues they run across as they do a thorough inspection. This is auto repair that you can trust and feel confident with. A few years back my sister in law drove over the hill from the Bay Area for thanksgiving weekend. Before she left the bay, her auto shop told her the trip would be risky that she needed brakes. I called Steve the Friday after thanksgiving and he told me to bring the car in and he would check it out. After the inspection he stated she had 50% brakes front and rear. He could have sold me a brake job after I had told him the story, but he didn't, he was honest, because honesty is how they roll at Reno Vulc."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I decided to try AutObsessions because they are close to home and the pictures of their previous work looked great. The car is a SuperSnake and it has lots of places where wax builds up. For example, I had dried wax lines along the hood and trunk stripes and all along the clear paint protector film which covers the front, sides and rear. After they were finished, the dried wax was completely gone and the paint looked a mile deep. It never looked so good. Moreover, the wheels are black and easily show water stains but they also looked better than new. They did such a good job on my toy that I'll be bringing the day driver in for the full treatment and I'm sure it will feel like a new car.
Nick worked with me to pick the best weather to bring the car in, which is really appreciated. It's bad enough it drive the car home in the rain (OR SNOW) but the tires have zero traction on anything less than hot, dry asphalt. He definitely went the extra mile for me. Nick, Jorge and the crew do an outstanding job."

I was pleasantly surprised by the level of service they provided. I will be back. I would give a zero if I could. I went in to get a simple tire repair and they told me my tire had to be replaced. They told me I needed a new tire and that they could do it for $75. I walked out of there and got a new tire. They are rude and do not care. I will not go back. It is a shame that I am paying $75 for a tire repair. I would not recommend them to anyone. My car had a nail in it. I was going to buy a new tire for $20, but not anymore.

I went to the shop and they replaced the alternator and it was perfect.  The mechanic even told me that my alternator was bad, but they did not charge me for the labor.  I am very grateful for this shop and will be bringing my car back here to get serviced.  Thank you!I have to say I am not the only one to have had a bad experience.

Went in looking at a used Passat listed at $15,700 after a test drive I asked what the out the door cost would be. Answer $19,500 ARE YOU KIDDING ME! So let's do the math. Sales tax $1100 new tag and title transfer per DHSMV website $300 so total cost so far $17,100. So they wanted to charge me $2,400 in dealer fees! But it only gets better. After telling them my bottom line they find another car. I was told before test driving it that the vehicle (out the door)would not exceed my bottom line. So I test drive the car and agree to buy it. Well not so fast, Because now its $900 over what I already told them I could not go. So I was told sorry have a nice day. Honestly, this was up there on my all time bad dealership experiences. Just the fact I was told it would cost $600 or more for a tag and title was ridiculous."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I took my forester,which I purchased at larry h miller, in for an oil change. I had purchased the 3 oil change bundle. The last oil change was done at the new building and was a horrible experience.
When I arrived I asked the employee who took my keys if it would be a long wait. He said it wasn't very busy.
Two hours later a rep comes out with a little dish of oils ""from my car"". The oils were the filthiest of colors and the rep told me the colors should be a cherry red color. The reason for the rep bringing this dish out was because I had not done my 65,000 service. The truth was I had not done my 65,000 service through larry h miller, but had taken it taken it to another shop where I was given a walk through of the work afterwards. 
This guy lied to my face and was literally trying to rip me off. Not only was I made to wait for over 2 hours for a basic oil change, but I was then lied to. Stay away from this shady establishment with its shady employees."

I was told it was an 'unfortunate coincidence' that my transmission blew on that same day.  After years of spending hundreds on repairs (within days of oil changes) I just don't believe anything out of their mouths.  The new shop has state of the art equipment and this sabotage can easily be done while your car is with them for an 8 hour oil change.  When I called from the side of the road after picking it up from the shop and shared how it was very similar to a bike chain breaking (transmission, duh) I got a very dramatic 'I have no idea what that could be.
The sensor connections were cut causing the gears to grind and blow the transmission.

The Audi A8 is a piece of garbage. Two weeks after purchasing it, we experienced electrical problems and within a two year period this car has been in their service department over 15 times, at one point being in their for a three month period. The staff is very unprofessional, when you're not purchasing a vehicle, so is the owner. Very arrogant and petulant. This experience with Audi has been a total nightmare. At this very moment we are still experiencing electrical issues with a 100k car. We have owned all kinds of luxury cars from Bentley to Mercedes Benz and feel that the customer service with Audi is disappointing, to say the least and I feel we've been treated poorly and with irreverence.

When I got to the counter, I was the only one there, but it still took nearly a half hour to get a car.  My check-in was interrupted several times for people dropping off their cars for parking.  When I was finally checked in, I was told they were ""getting my car ready.""  Huh?  They had the reservation.  What was there to get ready?  When the car finally showed up, I was shocked.  I have flown nearly a million miles and have rented cars around the country and around the world.  Never have I seen a car with such a stained interior.

A bit of internet digging proved this to be false... After speaking with Todd of U drive automoviles regarding a vehicle he had for sale I decided to run some Vin checks on line. What I came up with was the user name for the business (which goes under del-vet) on bringatrailer.com. There, I found two vehicles which were bought on bringatrailer.com and now relisted for huge mark ups! One, an nsx was purchased for 84k and listed for 122k. Another, an integra type r was purchased by them for 26k and listed for 42k. Now I do understand the dealership needs to make a profit, but to me this is deceitful.

BIG MISTAKE. HUGE. Not only did they try to sell us on a bunch of unnecessary items after fixing the recall issue (replacing the airbag because there were instances of glass popping out and cutting passengers), but they also blamed us for ALL of the lights (front, rear, fog lights, brake lights) burning out at the SAME TIME. Claimed we couldn't prove it wasn't like that when we brought it in. Then, they wanted to charge us $50 for each bulb. Things haven't changed at all at Tom Wood.

I got my car done at another place and the color was off and they said it was because of sun damage to the original pain that's why it was off, but it was perfect here. I am thinking of going back to the other place and show them what good work looks like. 

Final note: They called early in the morning to say the car would be finished later that day, unfortunately I couldn't get there until after they close but Nick stayed late just to make sure I got my car and everything was acceptable.

It drives the same as it did before the accident ( I noticed some shaking while stopping on the freeway and will contact them about it, but am confident they will check it out).

They saw my vehicle very quickly and got me a response within a half hour- even though I told them what I needed. They charged me a service fee just for running an electrical test with results that I already knew. Then they wanted to charge me over $400 for a new battery and labor. As a female, I know it doesn't look like I know when I'm getting ripped off, but I know enough to know a battery is around $120- which means you charge around $280 for labor and tax?

Maybe do your jobs instead of standing around laughing and talking? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

People have quite a bit on their minds, and I don't frequent the car wash every day of my life. If I'm distracted by your clanging the brush up against my car and screaming at your friends across the hood, I might forget to put my car in neutral. 

Should that happen, screaming at me loudly through my window and then proceeding to talk to me like I'm an infant for your inability to do your job (once again...pointing to a sign. #difficult) is probably a bad call.

I tried to call but no answer...I left a message.  These two need direct supervision. Needless to say my car was not clean as prescribed on the menu.  I went back around for a another wash. The two employees were Still goofing off.  Did my back end get cleaned no. Because they didn't properly spray the car prior to the machine wash. 
Plus the spot free dyer is NOT spot free. 

Where is the manager? Do you really think you can hire kids to do a job and not supervise? Of course not.

I am going back to the car wash on Longley and S. Virginia st. Plus that car wash has free towels to dry off the car."

I was lucky to find this place in the past. The staff are friendly and professional. They provide fast, efficient service. I have used them for years and they have never failed to disappoint. I highly recommend them. This place is awesome. I went in for a brake job, and they were able to do it quickly and efficiently. They kept me updated on the progress, and even showed me a few things that needed attention. They didn't try to pressure me into doing anything unnecessary, and I felt like they were honest with me.

Then Monday afternoon as I tried to back into my driveway the clunking turned into a growling and clunking and reverse gear refused to budge. All other gears functioned, and a friend drove the car frontwise into the driveway. I called Reno Vulcanizing at this location and spoke to Justin describing the problem. I made an appointment and took the car in on Tuesday. The staff I spoke to, Justin, Tiffany and Chris were pleasant and kept me updated on the progress of the repairs. I picked up the car today. The price was more than fair for the work that was done. The bottle of cold water left for me was a nice touch on a hot day. Reno Vulcanizing is versatile and can do many types of car repairs. The business I consulted before them told me I would have a two week wait and that if the problem was the transmission instead of what I  thought it  was, they didn't work on  transmissions.

In 2019 my breaks were acting up, and I took a chance on this Midas because of its proximity. I wish I could remember the employee's name, but she talked me through everything wrong in a way that I could understand but without being condescending, which as someone who does not understand cars, I very much appreciated. During that time, I also talked to Sean, and the topic of my broken AC and my complicated history of being able to get it fixed came up. He looked it up for me and said whenever I'm ready it could be fixed there with no problems. From 2017 to 2018 I went to four different auto repair establishments for my AC and game out with huge bills for other repairs and a sudden ""actually we don't have the parts to fix your AC, sorry""s.

I was driving around with a messed up tire for over two months. I was consistently putting air in my tire all while dreading the idea of having to get a new tire. I had a small conversation with my dad and he recommended CDM tires.

Once I arrived, I was greeted by this young kid who was friendly and personable. I told him what was going on with my tire and he jacked my car up, looked at the tire and told me it had a nail in it. Then he put air in the tire plugged it up all for 15.00. 

Service was quick and fast. I ended up giving him a 10.00 tip for the wonderful service and affordable prices. My dad has two plugged tires and he along with the young kid said the plugged tires can last a long time.

Even with a scheduled appointment it has been over 2.5 hrs and they still haven't finished the alignment. My car has 44 miles on it. After all this time my service advisor has yet to give me an update. When I inquired how much longer it would be they said that they ""have been doing this a long time, don't have an estimated time because the tech is not by the vehicle (probably eating lunch), and that alignments can take this long"". I've literally owned 24 vehicles (Audi, BMW, Land Rover, Lexus, etc.) and I have never had an alignment take this long. Especially, not on a brand new sports car. Requiring service on a brand new car happens. However, attitude accompanied by an excessively long wait for basic service shouldn't. I will never use MB of Tampa service again. Absolutely terrible."

Automotive,1.5,OR,"This is actually about online Thrifty and particularly their overseas rentals.
Whatever you think you're arranging, especially if it's not something standard, DO NOT ASSUME Thrifty in the U.S. will stand behind whatever arrangements they make with overseas companies to get you a vehicle. 
I checked and double-checked, even with their so-called""specialty desk"" (actually subbed out to Dollar Rental), to make sure we could get a 7-passenger vehicle in Reykjavic, Iceland this July. While everything appeared to be set, when we actually got to the Saga Car Rental in Iceland, the vehicle only seated 5, with maybe an extra seat (no seatbelt) for a small child you didn't like so much. We ended up paying almost twice what we'd expected to for a vehicle that we could actually all fit in.
I don't think it was the fault of Saga Car Rental; they said they'd reserved what they'd been asked to. Thrifty dropped the ball here; but when I complained upon returning, they told me that since we'd signed the contract with Saga, we'd have to take up any complaints with them. They were absolutely not taking any responsibility for their screw-up.

I was looking for a new car, but unfortunately I had to find someone close to where I needed it. I thought I'd try someplace else. They had one, but they were very much like ""that's a good deal"" for me. They didn't have the color I wanted, but they had one on stock. I didn't have to wait long, and they took care of everything.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"At first the man on the phone was very friendly and I felt good about coming there. However, upon arriving a few minutes late the man at the front desk made a snarky remark about how I was late. Then, I was told that my battery was the original battery and needed to be replaced even though I drive a Mazda (the battery isn't a Mazda battery). I was there for two hours and half of which my car was left with no one working on it. I had to walk outside and out my belonging in my parked unlocked vehicle with the top still open to get them to acknowledge me. I understand I am a young female but I do not recommend this business. Their prices are not worth their unfriendliness and I would recommend going to a dealership. I also got home and my windshield fluid was still empty even though it was checked green that it was full. Disappointed in the snarky looks the mechanic was giving me. I also mentioned a 10 dollar coupon which I had to ask for twice to put on my bill. Just bad. Unless you have two hours for an oil change go somewhere else."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I'm sad that I have to leave a bad review for this place. A lot of the workers are really nice, except for the manager and the owner.  One day I went through the car wash and upon leaving I noticed bumping sound coming from my tires.  I drove right back into the lot of a car wash and discovered a bolt in one of my front tires. While going through the car wash I sat in my car and I heard grinding sound and then sound of a puncture.  I explained this to the manager and he implied I was making it up. I asked for my tire to be replaced. He accused me of lying. He said that they would not take responsibility whatsoever. When I got to BMW to have my tire replaced, I discovered a bolt in the other tire as well. So apparently I got two bolts in my tires in the car wash. The owner could have offered to reimburse me for my monthly car wash Membership. Or could have offered a free membership for a year. But they offered no help.  There was no ""I'm sorry"".  The worst customer service I've ever experienced."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I had a jiffy lube coupon for a $20 oil change (from their website, not Groupon) so I figured I would try them out. First of all a regular priced oil change is approximately $44, which is astronomical considering my dealership only charges $30.  The coupon touted a number of ""free services"" provided with an oil change. I didn't get charged for any additional, but at least 2 of the services were poorly done or not done at all. On my receipt, it stated that cleaning exterior windows was done, but that was clearly not true considering the amount of bugs and dirt still on the windshield and other windows. Second, the windshield washer fluid was replaced with water. Finally, as soon as I leave my change oil light comes on. None of these are huge problems, but if they skipped that much that I can see, it makes me wonder what they skipped that I cannot see. Guess it will cost me another trip to the dealership, which I was trying to avoid in the first place. Next time I'll pay $10 more to avoid the hassle. 

Update: unfortunately the customer service email provided is invalid. Failure to send notice on two attempts."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Great experience!! We came into town to help our son buy a car. This was the first dealership we shopped. Looked at a couple of cars within his budget but he didn't really like the choices. Then the salesman suggested a Nissan Xterra that they had recently taken in as trade. It wasn't retail ready, we were able to take it for a drive.  It checked most of our son's must-haves. However, since this was our first stop, we wanted to take a look at other options just to be sure. They let us leave without pressuring us into buying the Nissan. We drove down the street and went to half dozen other dealers. They Either didn't have the inventory or we're just plain creepy salespeople. 
We returned to Mountain West and sales team worked very hard to make the numbers work for us. The whole experience was pleasant and fun. These are not your typical used car lot. They are gracious, polite and professional. They really want to make sure you get into the right car with the right deal. I've bought a lot of cars over the years and I was very impressed with this transaction. I highly recommend Mountain West auto."

When I got to the dealership I was told they didn't have a loaner car.  I told them I had a loaner car, and they said they would have to order the part and come back and get it.  They didn't have the part.  It took them another day to get it and we had to leave it for another day.  They promised us it would be ready in the afternoon, but when we got there they said they would have to order the part.

I made an appt. at the Jeep dealership in Reno but it was for the next day and they said they would charge me an hour labor ($135)  to diagnose it. I called Adam's Hi Rollin Customs and he said come right over and it would only be $45 to diagnose it. When my dad and I got there and explained what was going on, he said that sometimes the wheel bearing goes out and the metal shavings stick to the wheel sensor and it causes the sensors to come on. Adam diagnosed the left front as not reading. It took less than twenty minutes. 

We went home took the wheel bearing and sensor off and sure enough he was right. Metal shavings were caked onto the sensor. Autozone had the part in stock and I was able to fix it before dinner! I was blown away with his knowledge and his helpfulness. I will take my vehicle back there for anything that comes up. Great customer service, great price and Adam is a really cool guy!"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I give Josh, our salesman, and the business manager five stars for honesty and sincerity when it comes to the purchase of our used car from Del.  The dealership should clone these two. The sales manager and used car manager were sweet as pie at the start -- but, when the deal got complicated, the two of them transformed from nice guys into the clichéd, unpleasant car salesmen every buyer dreads.  There are too many details to list here and too many ""he saids, she saids"" but, suffice it to say, this car deal had become a nightmare.
However, it all ended well when I contacted owner Jack Dell.  I left a voicemail and he returned my call within hours.  This was on a summer Friday when many business owners would have checked out for the weekend the day before.  He heard me out and allowed me to explain my side of the story.   Mr Dell offered a solution to the series of missteps that happened which left me satisfied.  He also gave assurances that he'd counsel his team to make sure they'd handle things in a more professional, respectful way in the future.  I hope he did."

Automotive,4.0,OR,"I've been a repeat customer for over 10 years and always found Rod to be honest and fair-workmanship first class. I took my brother-in-laws pickup in because it wouldn't start, thought it was the starter solenoid. I got a call that it would be $214 that the battery was bad. I was surprised at the price for just a battery. It's probably still less than going to a dealer but obviously cheaper to DIY.
The vehicle was ready the same day.  Rod has changed his internal organization structure and process. I have been accustomed to dropping a vehicle off and getting an estimate to repair. Now you will see a diagnostic charge followed up with the description of repairs needed and the cost to repair. In this case the diagnostic fee was 1/2 hour and $45. The battery was $120 and $45 labor plus some incidental tax and shop charges. 
I don't know how this diagnostic fee/process compares to other repair shops.   I would rate the quality of work higher than 3 stars. The Service writer and follow up process are better than before but pricing may now be a higher by the diagnostic fee or maybe it was included but not itemized before."

Automotive,2.5,OR,"The manager told me I needed new engine mounts that would cost 4 hundred dollars. He then added I would then need an alignment that was another hundred dollars. This was a surprise and came out of nowhere since my SUV was only a couple years old and it was not having any problems. The manager in my opinion was acting very suspicious and very unconvincing, I sensed that he was just trying to make his monthly quota.

I told the manager no thanks, and I took my SUV to a Toyota dealer. The mechanic at the Toyota dealer put the car on the lift and inspected the engine mounts and then test drove my SUV. He said there was absolutely nothing wrong with my engine mounts, in fact he said that on this particular model they rarely ever go bad. 

I feel sorry for gullible people who fall for these unnecessary repairs!

Note: This happened several years ago and is the reason I never went back and the reason for this poor review. Unfortunately, this type of practice is not unique to TirePlus, it happens at many of these ""chain"" stores as well as all types of repairs shops.

So I'll be much more detailed now...

I went in with my mother to help her find a car. The sales rep was insanely rude. So much so that I had to ask myself, ""is this really happening?!""
They guy basically started berating my mother because her credit wasn't good (which is one reason why I was there, to cosign). She's an old lady guy! Did it make you feel good?? I also heard from other people that they had similar experiences...

So before that incident I went there to look at a used Tundra, which was also a mistake. They sales guy kept driving me around in some piece of junk Nissan Titan and wouldn't show me the truck I wanted. Took 30min for him to quit messing around with that stupid titan...
Then I saw the truck... it was a 1997 4wd tundra with 200k miles. Worth maybe 10k?? They wanted close to 19k! WAY OVER PRICED.
The truck also had buttons in the dash that just fell apart during the test drive!

My lease was coming due on my Mazda 3.  I had two babies in 15 months, so I was in the market for a big obnoxious SUV.  I was going to have to be one of THOSE people.  After doing a lot of research, I decided to try a Chevy Traverse.

Never having owned a big car before, I was a little skeptical about the whole experience.  Gary made everything so much easier to deal with!  

Gary is extremely knowledgeable and very, very patient.  He takes his time to walk you through every step of the way, which is really hard to come by in car dealerships.

Gary also allowed my husband to take a test drive on his own (he drove the Traverse from the dealership to our house about 5 miles away) so I could look at it before I came in to make a final decision.  Bryner also offers a shuttle to and from the dealership which is obviously very convenient.

My fiancé, unfortunately, purchased his range rover from Paretti. Their service department cannot get anything right. We have taken it in for service on four separate occasions with a list of over ten items, they have fixed only two items on the list, both of which they claimed were not covered under the warranty, one being the brakes. With only 12000 miles there is no reason that the brakes should be worn down and squeaking. Now that it has 16000 miles they are doing the same thing. He has the towing package and they can't seem to turn it on, they claim it's fixed, we get it back and low and behold, nothing fixed! The rental they provide is no where near comparable. He was driving a Ford Escape for weeks that was conveniently governed at 70 miles an hour.

The customer service is always good and the price is reasonable. I would highly recommend the car wash.I recently moved to Philadelphia from California and had a great experience here. They were friendly and helpful and my car was spotless. It took about an hour and a half and they were able to get my car into the shop quickly and efficiently.

Automotive,4.0,CG,"UPDATE 12/27: Contacted customer service and asked if they could refund the full amount for my car.  The owner said they had to get a manager to get the manager to refund the full amount.  They had no record of the money they were charged for the service.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I will never ever use them again.  I will be taking my business elsewhere.I came here to get my car serviced because it was close to my home.  I had a coupon for the $25 oil change, which I was happy with.  When I went to get my car, I was told it would take about 15-20 minutes for an oil change.  That was a bit of an inconvenience.  I didn't like the fact that I was sitting in the waiting room for 15-20 minutes for an oil change.  I was told it would take about 45 minutes.  I thought it was pretty convenient for me to get a $20 off coupon on the website."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"My car unexpectedly conked out of the parking lot and I was in a hurry. I was just about to leave but the driver was so helpful and friendly! He even took a look at my car and told me about the problem I had. He even told me to come back in the morning and he'd check with him to see if I had any other options. I've had great experiences at other mechanics and I felt like I was being taken care of! I couldn't recommend this place enough. I will be going back for sure.I recently moved to Philadelphia from California and had a great experience here. They were friendly, friendly and efficient. I would highly recommend them.This was my first time using this business, and I've been going to this location for years. I have been coming here for a few years now, and have never had a problem.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Bought a Kia in January 2020. Obviously very happy with the car itself.

I was told when I bought my Kia I would have a complimentary oil change when it was due for the first time. I call in and ask about their pick up service (considering COVID19) and their service department says ""oh you have to get a tire rotation"" so I ask the cost, and she says 19.99$. No problem right? So then I need a spare bc my Kia apparently does not come with one. Again, no problem. I speak with parts, they quote me 209.00$. Again, no problem. Then they transfer me back to the service department and the SAME girl says she spoke with the service manager and he won't allow them to pick up my car bc my oil change is complimentary....the answer changes in 7 minutes. 

So I called back, and asked parts JUST for the spare and I'd get my vehicle serviced elsewhere. The parts people and manager end up working it all out for me and they're coming up with a resolution. So thanks to their Parts Manager, I have changed my rating. He understood exactly what I was trying to accomplish. 

Thanks! 

So we will see, but they are acting quickly."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I bought my nephew's 350Z. I inherited a Macco installed front bumper held on with tie wraps and cheap aftermarket headlights. I found Exotic Customs on Craig's list while I was looking for a new bumper. Mike Snyder of EC had a like-new one from his 350Z he was customizing. When I went to pick it up and I was listening to him discuss repairs, I got a sense that he was the man to fix my car. Mike is very frank, honest and transparent in his approach to repairs. He also happens to be an expert on 350Z's (but I will let him tell that story). Mike is not a ""cut corners"" kind of guy; he likes to use quality (often OEM) parts, has exceptional access to get parts quickly and the installation was top shelf quality. 

My experience with EC was not for anything exotic, but the results were fantastic. I paid a fair price and I don't have to drive around with extra tie wraps anymore. So if you are interested in getting a repair done that is top shelf at a fair price consider Mike Snyder and Exotic Customs. 

p.s.: If you are looking to go exotic in customizing your car, you gotta talk to Mike."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Customer service is terrible

Brought my car in for recalls. They had it all day so I called to see if it was ready. No one answered so after several calls, I called another department. I was transferred 11 times  and hung up on twice. Called and pressed 0 for the operator. They pick up the phone, say nothing and place me on hold. After trying a couple times and 10 minutes in, I called the sales department. A nice young man said he would walk back there to see if my car was ready. 10 minutes later he comes back to say it was ready. It was nice of him but sales only answers because they want to make a sale. Once you buy the car, they don't care about you.

Oh and live chat is a joke. I think it was a computer I was chatting with and not a person. They refused to call me even though I gave my number and they asked me for an email address. I just needed to know if my car was ready to be picked up. 

I would give negative stars if I could. Avoid any place like this that doesn't value customers. The money from customer money funds your paycheck."
Automotive,1.0,OR,"If I could I would give them 0 stars. They were assigned to assist me through my insurance, Allstate. My car broke down and I tried to jump it but that didn't work so I called for a tow at 7:30pm. My first ETA was long, 9:13pm and it should have been my first hint to just find my own tow truck. I called a few times before the lady answered and she said ""you still have 18 minutes till your ETA, my driver should be there"" when I asked her why so long, she said they only had 2 tow trucks. So we waited a little until 9:15. I called back and asked what's going on and she said he would be there between 9:45-10. Ok I waited this long, let's just get this car out of here. So I waited some more which was a big mistake. I ended up pushing the car into a parking spot and leaving it there. What a waste of my life waiting for this tow truck. So if you do happen to get this company please have black widow on standby to say "" ok big guy the sun is getting low"" because you will be big green and totally pissed off"

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Warning: they do not stand behind their work nor will they do right by the customer. 

I've been going to their Westampton location since the previous owner, Mike ran it. Always found them to be the most honest and reliable mechanics I'd ever encountered and as a result I've sent a ton of business their way. Sadly I can't say this about the new owner, Tim. This guy definitely doesn't stand by his work. 

A year ago my car had an engine failure. After discussing with the mechanic we decided to replace the engine. That's when the nightmare started. A year later and after $5000 spent I'm still without the car. The mechanic admits they can't or don't know how to fix it but the owner refuses to give me a refund. I've been beyond patient giving them every opportunity to make good, but Tim can apparently care less about his clients. 

Fair warning, they DO NOT Guarantee they're work. If they screw up, you'll be eating the cost and may even be without a vehicle. Not worth the risk. Find another shop. I sadly have to now prepare a filing court one year after I have them my car to fix so I could pass it on to my daughter."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"In the beginning I was so pleased with my services but what I found disturbing is everyone says if u need anything please feel free to call exactly one month after my purchase I pay my Jeep payment and the next day the vehicle shuts off on me as I am driving it took me literally 8 calls to the service center and reaching out to those who helped me with my purchase before I could get anyone to pay attention to me and assist with my vehicle break down. Afterwards I was told that I needed to set an appointment and find a way to get the vehicle back to them to figure out the problem. A hour into being immobile with googling I realized that there was another crystler dealer about 3miles in Dade away I was able to reach. They gave me wonderful service but I was upset that I had just paid a car payment and had to spend $100 that I did not have to get my car looked at only for them to tell me 2 days later that it was a technology update needed, which should have been done before me purchasing the vehicle. Smh so displeased I feel like I should be refunded."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I've rented cars about 10 times so far this year at Bna and often end up with a hertz brand because they are one of the few that actually have cars for rent now. So they're getting my business for now but as soon as there's competition they'd better look out because they have made me absolutely hate their company! First, lines at the airport are enormous and they typically just have 1 agent helping ppl. It usually takes 60-90 minutes between arriving at the rental desk and driving off. Second, and the worst thing, is that they ALWAYS try to give me a smaller cheaper car than what I reserved. If I weren't attuned to this scam they'd get away with it, and I have to raise hell just to get the class of car I reserved. They always tell the same lie, that they're ""the same."" Even tho their own web site differentiates in terms of the number of ppl and luggages that the different classes can hold. So it's a total scam, probably illegal, like bait and switch. Im sure a lot of folks don't argue with them and are cheated. You win for now Hertz but I will dump you so fast when the rental market recovers."

I went to Urgent Care the same time she took her car in, I was through Urgent Care and went to Firestone because they were still there!! And it took almost another hour for them to even get to her car. Seems they had time to stop what ever they were doing to fill tires for the people on the Fiesta bike ride!! I saw a lot of nothing being done and a lot of talking going on in the car bay. When the man in charge heard me say something about it it opened a window into the shop and finally said something. My daughter explained she had a 5 &1/2 hour drive to get home and she would probably miss her son perform on stage if it would take 2 hours to repair a flat. Apparently that didn't seem to matter to them at all. Thanks for being so inconsiderate. There are so many complaints about this tire shop I am surprised the owners aren't reprimanding the workers.

Paul - This is a disappointing review to read. We strive for competitive pricing here, and I would be more than willing to speak with you directly about the cost of any vehicle you are interested in and ensure that we clear up any confusion. I'm going to look up your contact information, but please don't hesitate to give me a call.
Thank you,

Don - I posted this because I was able to get clarity on pricing.  No confusion on my side.  Just wanted to level set the field with future customers.   I do find it interesting that it is called a protection package with no value added items that protect the vehicle."

I came back within the following couple weeks to get the car problems fixed, and I was brushed off with the suggestion to go to AutoZone and buy a couple new parts. Extremely unprofessional. Unfortunately, I went to AutoZone and I still had to return to Maple Shade for persisting issues that were covered under my warranty. Their solution was to put a patch on my tire and send me on my way. One of the people who works there even yelled at me saying, ""take your car and leave"" when I asked if more could be done for the car. I never raised my voice or got upset with this man, and I was simply trying to handle business as a new car owner. Please learn from my mistake -- do not do business with Fiat of Maple Shade. They are a mess, to put it lightly. I genuinely felt as if they did not care about me as a person or a customer - so much so that they felt the need to yell in order to get me out of their establishment. Can't make this stuff up.

Dan White the service manager says it could not have been from them cause I drove over 5,000 miles with it leaking first and it would not have taken that long to pop out. Well guess what, NO ONE but Fuccillo Nissan has touched my oil plug. I also got a second opinion that it can drive loose for up to 10,000 miles before popping out. So beware they will ruin your new car and be rude about it. Dan White was defensive and rude before I could say a word. Nissan Manufacturer said they did not even put in to use my warranty just jumped down my throat saying its not their fault and won't fix it. ""Must have been vandalized"" they said.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"I only gave a conservative 4 stars since my experience with Indy Tires @ Carmel was limited; it was a very good one. I had a flat tire overnight with a big ol' nail stuck to it. I didn't have too much time to take it in for repair that day, so I tried one of those fix-a-flat sealants. It didn't completely seal the puncture, so drove wife's car to work instead.  I called around for repair appointment, both Tire Plus and Midas refused me  because the sealant was used. One told me it would ruin their machine, and the other said they would have to clean the entire tire ""inch by inch"" and that would end up costing me more than buying a new tire. Both of their solutions: buy a new tire. Sure.  So I called Indy Tire randomly and reached Chris.  He said it would take them a little extra work but would take care of it without any additional charge. No problem, that was their job, he said.

Automotive,3.5,CG,"I just purchased an used vehicle from them.  The salesman was nice and knowledgeable.  However, the service department is a complete joke.  The car was not properly serviced and the service manager told me it was fixed and it was no problem.  After two days I was still waiting for a call back.  I also had to have the car back for the check engine light to come on.  I had to go to the dealership because it was late in the day and it was still on my way home.  I called the service department again, and was told that it was fixed and that it would be ready by the end of the day.  I had to pay for the check and to have the car back for the check engine light to come on again.  When I went to pick up the car, the check engine light was still on.  I had to get the car back to the service department and get a loaner car.  I had to pay for the rental car.  When I got home, the check engine light"

The mechanic was very nice and told us we would be charged for it. This is a very honest mechanic. They found the problem and the bill was exactly what we paid for. We had already been there a few months before and they were able to fix it. We are very thankful for their help. They are a very good shop. I needed a new tire, and I was very pleased with their service. I called around and got quotes from some places that were closer to where I live. I was given the best price for my tire and didn't have to wait long. I also received a free car wash for the next month. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I was greeted by my service advisor, and he was very helpful. He called me about 20 minutes later, and was very friendly."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"I have a 1999 Honda Accord that was in BAD need of an alignment. I called up Duke & Jay's at 7:00 on a Saturday morning, and got an answering machine that stated that I could leave a message and somebody would call me back to schedule an appointment, (I thought to myself, great, so maybe I'll get a call on Tuesday or Wednesday, [given that their hours were from 8:30-11:00 on Saturday's], so my hope of getting my car aligned on Saturday was quickly dashed).To my pleasant surprise, Jay called me at 8:00 and said that he would ""work my car in"" if I could drop it off soon, I dropped my car off at 8:50, Jay called me at 10:00 stating that it was done, and that he thought the outcome was better than he originally thought that it would be given the severity of my mis-alignment. Jay was working by himself and used the old-school ANALOG alignment technique. Just because there is newer technology ie: laser alignment, doesn't mean it's better......He was more efficient, more accommodating, and much cheaper than any other alignment shop in town, and I couldn't be any happier with this guy and his shop, he will get my repeat service as well as any of my friends/family's business!!!"

I have been shopping around for few weeks, with multiple visits and test drive and decided to seal the deal on 5/30/2019. 
From the receptionist Aiyana, to the sales Brittney and. Sales manager Steve and Eric the finance Manager.

Their Staff Manager is very professional and took great care of us. Brittney and The sales manager I believe his name is Steve, took their time and resolved the deal on hand. The deal was their was a scratch on the paint and Steve decided to take care of the paint. Brittney and Steve are true to their words. 

They even provided a loaner vehicle while my car  is at the dealership for a small paint job. Brittney kept me updated. Thank You Britney and Steve.

I would highly recommend all of my customers, friends, relatives to Dolan Lexus in the future if they are looking for vehicles.  So happy with the purchase. 

Remember SERVICES from any dealer is very important. I don't recall receiving any stellar service from any dealership other then Dolan Lexus. Dolan Lexus Is a excellent dealer."

I dealt with Frank in finance and he is a bitter unhappy person. He kept trying to sell me a warrantee and other extras that I did not want, every time I told him no he got more and more upset. I did purchase gap insurance, which she said I could cancel at any time and when I called him a month later to cancel he would not return my call. I finally went down on Friday to cancel it and when I went to his office to talk to him he ordered me out and told me to sit down and wait for him. I told him that he's rude and he cannot talk to me like that and I talk to the manager and had someone else cancel the policy for me. If you do a Chapman used cars do not have Frank help you asked for Virginia. She help me cancel my policy and was very apologetic. I have heard from other people that Frank is very rude and aggressive and I totally agree. The manager of Chapman used cars should've done more to correct the situation."

I called and spoke with a manager named Mr. Lillia and he assured me that they would get it taken care of and to get back to me. I arrived at the dealership to pick up my car and the service rep I spoke with was rude and unhelpful. I asked him what the issue was and he said ""it's not covered under the warranty.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"DO NOT GO HERE. I took my car in for inspection in December and was told my rear brakes were 2 and 30 seconds and my front were 7. They told me to replace the back brake pads and the front didn't need it yet. Over $400 later I had new brake pads. Fast forward to today whenever I took my car to a private garage because I was hearing a really bad grinding noise whenever my car came to a stop. The mechanic informed me that I needed all new brake pads and rotors on all 4 tires. Mind you, I only put 7,000 miles on my car since December. I don't know what piece of garbage brake pads they charged me so much money for, but I called them to find out if they were under warranty and what they would do to fix it and they told me it was only under warranty for 6 months or 6,000 miles. How convenient for them...all this place has to offer are a bunch of bottom or the barrel mechanics taught to use cheap parts to make people return more frequently and make more money off of customers.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"I set my appointment for a Friday morning between 8 and 12. I was very happy to get a call at 8:30 letting me know the technician would be at my house around 10:30. Very different from other companies that make you wait around all day. 

Sure enough at 10:20 he called to tell me he was pulling in. We went over the car to make sure we were both on the same page. He told me exactly what he was going to do, and what I should expect. We both looked at the new glass to make sure it had the heater elements and they would be hooked up correctly. (I have heard other glass places will try and give you a non heated glass). We went over the cost and insurance before he started anything. 

Less than an hour later he was finished. Aside from the glass being brand new, you couldn't tell it had been replaced. Every piece of trim was exactly where it was supposed to be. The gasket looks untouched. He even saved the velcro tabs for my easy-pass and helped put it back in the right place. 

Considering how long I've spent at the post office just to mail a letter, I was very impressed by his speed and professionalism."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"This place is horrible! I applied for credit on a vehicle I saw on their website, I know that when you apply for credit they are going to try to submit it to a bank to get you approved. The problem is they never informed me in a matter of one day that they have tried to get me approved through three banks and I was denied, there was no mention of that and I spoke to the salesman twice and the finance manager once. The finance manager was quite rude nor did he mention that they had been submitting my application to various banks. That is illegal they must inform a customer when they submit to different banks there was no mention of this between the sales person nor the finance manager to me when I talked to them in two days I am now receiving letters from banks saying that they have applied for auto loans for me and it is affecting my credit score. So word to the wise buyer beware if you apply for credit from this company and they may and you talk to them make sure you tell them to stop applying until you're ready to go in and buy the vehicle.

This was 3 months ago. He ended up buying a car , with his own $ and was very disciplined to not go over budget. He still has no title! He is given every excuse in the world and continues to make empty promises  as to when the title will be available. The title should have been given to him, the minute the deal was made. As of last Friday, he still didn't have it and promised it would be there today AND, for my son's patience, Johny would pay to register the car AND provide him with a pre-paid gas card. As I suspected, he was just talking out his ass to get my son to leave his office. When my son went , down to meet him,... he was OFF today. Needless to say, the car seems to be in great condition, but, my son can't drive it until it's registered. If I could have , I would have given them a 0star rating!!"

Automotive,3.5,CG,"Good points, they're friendly.

My issues are with the quality of work.

My only gripe is the fact that they don't get your car to get the job done right. I've been taking my car there for over a year now and it's always done right.

I also love that they're very quick to call when they can be done with the work they're doing. I've always had to leave a message and call.

However, when I go to pick it up, they always tell me they're too busy to get it done right. I usually call and make an appointment but today I called and was told it would take another 2 to 3 hours.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"Took our old 1982 Westfalia VW  for an inspection to check that our van would be good to go on a 6 month trip through California, told us that it had some oil leaks and needed a rebuilt engine one day (tell me something I didn't already know!) but there was nothing they could do about it, and didn't mention any other pressing maintenance needed. We are doing great travelling through California and Baja Mexico but just took a look at our brakes with a friend and they are severely worn down, to the point being illegal and needing new calipers. I get it that a new shop/dealership doesn't have the parts to do maintenance on an older vehicle, but I told Norden I was going on a trip to California and what did they recommend I do before I go. I had no idea from the inspection that the brakes were in such bad shape.... Our brake fluid was 2 inches under minimum , so they didn't even check our bRaker fluid which is pretty basic. Makes me wonder if the wheels were taken off during the inspection, that I paid close to 200 dollars for. We could have died! Maybe next time someone asks if you work on older VW's just say no, Norden."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"On Wednesday, March 27th, my friend and I went to purchase a used vehicle. I had cash on hand and was ready to deal. We were met at the door by a woman named Diana. We told her our purpose and asked to speak to the sales representative by the name of Josh. Diana informed us that Josh would not work with us on this purchase.  She proceeded to go back and forth to speak with someone in the back, supposedly. We asked to speak to Josh personally but was denied. In negotiating the price, with cash in hand, she could/would only take $100-$200 off the asking price. Even before we were done negotiating, she informed us this was over and to have a good day. I will add that we then went to another car dealership who greeted and worked with us and in the end we purchased a newer vehicle than we had intended. This dealership worked with us and made us feel comfortable and took us seriously. Don Hinds lost out on a sale because Diana didn't take us seriously, She refused to get us the sales rep that we had requested and more concerned about her commission than the customer. I highly recommend going to another dealership when looking for a vehicle."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I came across this place by chance. 
One night I was leaving CVS and heard a ""thunk thunk thunk"" on my tire. Thinking it was a flat, I pulled over to the parking lot near by. I did NOT want to go to Firestone because  they are overpriced and was relieved when I looked up to see the Z Brothers Auto Center logo. 

I asked the guy there if they could look at my car, he told me he would ask his boss to drive it around because he would know better as he had 30 years experience. He drove it around the lot and said ""okay flat tire, right side"". I went inside to wait with my boyfriend. 5 minutes later he comes out and says ""You're all set, it was a rock in your tire you're good to go"". Didn't charge me or anything. 

I came back a few day later to get my spark plugs changed, and also asked if they could look to see why my engine was stalling when it wasn't warmed up (turns out it was a bunch of dust collected on my engine). They cleaned it and fixed my spark plugs in 45 min. 

I'll be coming back here for more, they have pretty decent prices and quality service."

They didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need, they gave me a very fair price on the car I wanted, and the financing process was quick and easy.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"It's kind of hard to believe that I would give a 5 star rating for a car dealership. To be honest my 5 star rating goes to the gentleman who helped me. I came armed with a ton of questions. I am not yet ready to buy a new vehicle. But in the next month or so I will be. And I wanted to learn more about cars and get some info. John Pinkerton helped me out so much. He was not pushy or ""classic car sales"" guy. He understood that I was nervous about pulling the trigger on such a large investment and definitely wore kid gloves with me. John broke down the pros and cons according to what would benefit me about the vehicles I was looking at. He even showed me cars I did not think would be a good fit and opened my eyes to new possibilities. I am definitely going to go back to see him. John definitely knows his stuff and can make you feel comfortable and at home in that dealership.

Automotive,1.5,OR,"I WAS going to purchase from this dealer, because of my need and credit requirements. I was approved for a truck, and had been promised that a critical component had been changed out; the truck smelled like cigarettes and the cloth was covered in animal hair. I am glad I had taken the time to read through reviews and look into the BBB. The facts are: if you buy a used car, without inspection from a 3rd party, you don't know what you are buying. The dealer can promise anything, but if it's not in the Due Bill, it won't hold up when you make your claim. The proof is in the pudding when reviewing how the dealer responds to reviews on any platform: Google, Yelp, BBB. I called the next day that I had been apprpved, (I couldn't wait around for the bank because I had errands) and after reading reviews, I decided not to move forward with the purchase. The sales agent quickly retorted that it was already sold and first come first serve. Their behavior is very poor and unprofessional, their responses on social platforms are poor and unprofessional. I'm going to bet they will respond to this in an unprofessional manner and it will serve as proof.

Automotive,1.5,OR,I thought it was a great experience until I did not pay the rate that was on my reserved reservation over the Internet. Then there was the last day I had a flat tire I would have changed it myself but no jack in the car. Then since I did not take out road hazard it cost 60 dollars to have someone come from their service to change the tire. So I figured let it go then today in the mail I get a bill for 215.45. On the statement I was charged for repair time that took 3 days also 50 dollars in administrative fees. The statement. Said that the car was unavailable for 3 days to fix damages. Neither myself no the man who changed the tire could see why it went flat . So live and learn it apparently takes three days to fix a tire in Philadelphia and if it is your unfortunate circumstance it will cost you about 380.00 I always use a different company but they had a better weekly special so I tried them . I will never use thrifty again and will encourage others not to either. They may advertise a better price but they will nickel and dime you to death. However 380.00 for a flat tire is beyond unacceptable.

Immediately I decide to have it towed out to get a second opinion and to my surprise, all it was was the FUEL PUMP. THAT IS ALL!

He said he would look into it and a week later still no response from him.  By this time, I was fed up.  I filed a complaint with the BBB four days ago.

I will definitely be back and highly recommend this dealership!I will never buy a car from here again. I bought a car here and it's been a nightmare. They have no communication about what the car is worth, they don't call you when it's ready and then it's a long time. They never call you when they say they'll get back to you. I have been to a lot of dealerships and I can tell you I've had a lot of trouble getting a car. My experience at this dealership is terrible.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Here I am, approximately 6 months later, to let the whole world know...

My BMW X3 is STILL DOING AMAZING!

1 week off the lot: Realized tires were a little on the bald side, so we contacted management and in no time, 4 brand new tires were installed! Am I joking? Exaggerating? No. At first, I felt as if I'd have to go in with my guard up, ready for war, but unlike other car dealerships, you don't have to fight with them over treating you like you matter. They listened, they looked, they fixed. Simple as that!

That was really the only issue I can remember having with the SUV, other than that, it's been working beautifully!

If there is a place to spend your tax refund to buy a car (as it is tax season), look no further, this is IT. Are there other dealerships with 5 stars? Sure; but guess what, many of those reviews are paid for. That's not a guess, that's a witness observation. 

Although I just bought my car in September, I have to upgrade to a 6-7 seat vehicle, and you bet I'm coming back to High Sierra Auto Sales to buy... AGAIN. Good prices, great communication, kind staff and a nice selection; I have no reason to go anywhere else. 

Thank you for taking care of us!"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"When my wife and I moved to Louisiana a couple of years ago, I had to contemplate finding a new place to take our car, which can be quite a task. We were living in Metairie, so when I read good things about CARS on Yelp, I decided to try them. That was three years ago, and, even though we moved to New Orleans, I still go back to CARS. 

They have done several different things for me, from oil changes to tune-ups to repairing a side mirror. They did a great job every time, often going just a little beyond for no extra charge but never finding something to fix just for the sake of fixing it. I never have trouble making an appointment, and they always seem to get things done as quickly as they can--for an oil change or tune-up, I often just get a cup of tea at Whole Foods across the street and wait.

Michelle is friendly and efficient. When I called to ask her advice about how a certain aspect of owning a car in Louisiana works, she took ten minutes out of her day to talk to me and give me advice.

Overall, I would recommend CARS to anyone who lives in the area and wants to establish a good relationship with a car repair place."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I've been given the unfortunate pleasure to review this fine auto body shop.  My car has gone through many repair services throughout the 5 years I've had it, and Masselle's has always treated it like it's a Lamborghini instead of a 2000 Subaru Legacy (with over 100,000 miles).  They do a thorough job with any repairs and go above and beyond by cleaning the entire interior and exterior so your car welcomes you back as shiny as ever.  I also feel the need to emphasize that Masselle's is not like those auto body shops where you drop your car off for one thing and end up having a convenient/suspicious wiring issue.

Masselle's does quality work on many types of models and various years, but more importantly they do work fast.  My car needed a fender and headlight repair, but after several hit-and-runs (NOT ON MY PART), I asked if they could also do some cosmetic surgery on my poor little Subaru.  Steve, the owner, said it wouldn't cost that much more.  

All-in-all, it took 3 days and my Subaru looked and sounded better than when I first bought it.  Furthermore, the staff is very communicative, which makes for an easy and trustworthy experience.  You can tell that Masselle's truly takes pride in their work."
Automotive,4.5,CG,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE. The guys at this place are nice, but the customer service is terrible. I had a coupon for a oil change, and the first oil change took over an hour. 

They said it would be about an hour to two hours. I said no, and waited for another hour. I waited another hour and a half for them to finish. I was finally told they were finishing up my car. 

I went back to the mechanic and told them I had a coupon for a $10 off coupon for an oil change. They said it was $10 off. So I asked why it wasn't included in the price. They said that I should have told them I was going to go home to pick up my car. I was told that they had to put the coupon on my car. I asked why.

Automotive,1.5,OR,"I've gone to this shop over the years with a few different BMW's and have had a number of questionable ""situations"". I had a gas leak on my 96' E36, brought it in and they said 'oh yeah, you need this or that'. I picked it up, paid and brought it home only to have the same leak. Whatever they did, if anything, was wrong and did not fix the problem...they had to redo it of course.
The second time I brought my E30 in because it had a coolant leak, whereupon they pronounced (without looking)it needed all new throttle body hoses...$600 later I brought it home and guess what!!! still leaking!!! I brought it back and only then did they actually start looking for the leak which turned out to be the water pump etc. which was, of course another few hundred $$$.
The last escapade was with my 535is E28. It had an anti-lock braking problem. I brought it in and they did nothing on it for a month except shift it around their shop; finally telling me to come and pick it up;he would call me to bring it back when he got back from vacation...which, of course, he never did. 
Not trustworthy and not customer oriented. I guess they have too much business...maybe these bad internet reviews can fix that."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"I purchased a 1998 Acura Integra in the summer of 2020. The motor did not run, and I really had no idea where to start as the head was missing. I called around to check which shops would work on Japanese cars. Many shops turned me down as they advised getting a new motor installed is too big of a job....

Until I came across LPS Autoworks on Hampton Ave.

I spoke with the owner, dropped my car off and  he suggested that a motor replacement was the best route as the current motor had a lot of missing pieces. They ordered the motor and additional parts needed. 

I really appreciate that they took the time to complete the job, as it was a big one.

I have brought my car here a couple of times for different things and noticed this every time I visited:

They do excellent, clean work. They can always get you scheduled in a timely manner, and always reach out to you in regards to progress or anything else that may be needed. They will never try to upcharge you. Their pricing is very fair and most importantly, they are very friendly. The owner has always explained to me what was going on with my car and always provided me with a possible solution.

This is definitely the place to go!"

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I sometimes forget to follow up with reviews regarding service but I felt it was important to make sure this shop got its recognition. y first interaction was via phone w Chad, I explained my issue w my truck to see if it was something firestone could accommodate. He was polite accurate and efficient at explaining the process and setting me up to get in. I dropped the car off the night before and by 1030 the next morning Chad was calling me to come pick it up, that the repairs were complete. At this point I decided to ad a tuneup to the visit since I already had it at the shop, no problem he said give them Til 2. I arrive a quarter of 2, the truck was done and I was ready to check out. Chad informed me he only charged me for the portion of the tuneup that was necessary because the rest wasn't needed. Now any other shop would've taken the opportunity to run up the bill, especially being as I'm a woman and most of us don't know jack about our cars. That alone will have me bring me and my other vehicles to see Chad. The shop was clean, the service was good quality, prompt and professional. One less headache of my chaotic week ahead."

The price to find out the diagnoses of the vehicle was $88 which is pricy but I still said ok. When I got back they charged me $100.08 that's with tax and some extra fees that they don't tell you about. I asked what was wrong with the vehicle the guy said to look at the paper, the computer they plugged in said it was a speed sensor gas cap which was the same information that I got at AutoZone the same information that was pulled for free. I ended up getting a second opinion on my vehicle from a different mechanic he told me that the sensor and the gas cap was not the problem although my catalytic converter was he ended up changing it for me for about $100 and the car runs great the only reason I'm writing this review is to let people know that all they do to check the vehicle is plug it in the computer they do not test drive the vehicle they do not even turn it on from what it looks like.

I needed an oil change for my daughter's car so I went to this new Valvoline location in Riverview. The other local places I have been to were not good, so I was skeptical.

They were very friendly when I pulled in and when I asked them to be sure and check the tires they said that is part of the service. Great. 

The air conditioning was making a noise so I asked them to look at that for me and they said they would be happy too. 

Well I knew it was a possibility I would need to get her new tires and they showed me the issues. One was not repairable and another was bare. They gave me a great deal on 4 new tires so I said okay. They even checked the alignment for me and it was just fine. I really felt like I was at an honest place. 

I have a warranty for the car so when confirmation came that the air conditioning was shot I wasn't surprised. It was making grinding noises. 

They called my warranty provider and took care of everything. What a great experience. I thought they only did oil changes.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I have serviced my Alfa Romeo at Carlock Motorcars Nashville a few times so far and I am very pleased with their customer service. Most recently, I worked with Jonathan to service my car and he was polite, professional, and attentive. In addition to servicing my car for routine maintenance, I asked Carlock Motorcars Nashville to detail my car and they did a fantastic job! For the time period that the dealership was servicing and detailing my car, they provided me with a beautiful loaner car and were gracious in allowing me to return it a bit late because of my busy schedule. 

One thing that this dealership could improve on is answering calls. I called a few times to schedule an appointment and each time, either no one answered or someone did answer and said they would give me a call back; unfortunately, I did not get a call back. I voiced my concern to Jonathan and he was apologetic and vowed to improve the dealership's responsiveness. 

Other than that tiny issue, I highly recommend the services that Carlock Motors Nashville provides. Yes -- they may be expensive -- but they always call to ask for approval before performing a particular service on your vehicle and most importantly, their mechanics know how to perform services on what I would call rare or unique vehicles."

My fiancee and I went this weekend for an out-of-state emissions inspection and VIN tracing.  The service was rude and unprofessional.  We were told over the phone that the emissions test would be $50, and the VIN tracing would be FREE.  When we picked up the car later that day, they charged an additional $20 for the VIN tracing.  Not only did they NOT alert us beforehand about the additional charge, the manager/owner had actually asked us to go out to the parking lot and confirm the VIN number on the vehicle ourselves, because he was ""lazy"" (his actual words).  His explanation for the extra $20 was because he spent ""half an hour doing the paperwork"" and because he had ""put his personal information on the forms"".  Neither explanation makes sense - the DMV does not ask auto repair personnel to disclose personal information, and as a car repair service Midas should be well aware of the paperwork involved in an out-of-state VIN tracing when they originally quoted us the FREE service.  Lesson from this experience: STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE and take your hard earned money to a place that  understands customer service and appreciates your business."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Mr. Hall's honesty was so refreshing. Mr. Hall and his lovely wife run it - their sons and Mr. Hall are the mechanics. I took it to him after almost 2 dozen recommendations on Facebook  for a second opinion. The second valve was missing, it was overheating, burning water and  oil, the computer showed it needed a sensor and may have had major valve problems - or so I was told by two other mechanics, with an estimated between $500 to $700 quote. Mr. Hall checked the computer and told me that it looks like an $150 dollar job but if it is more serious he told me it might be better to get another car, but he thought it was just the coil. He went to tear it down with permission to replace the coil and came back and told me the sensor was unplugged and the spark plug cord or whatever it was called was broken at the tip. No problems with the radiator whatsoever. He charged me $42 to plug the sensor back and change the cord - he said my 2003 Impala drives like new. And it does. The honesty was refreshing.

This was  Nov 2017, After BBB finally got in contact with them again, they agreed to take the vehicle back at value price. That was March 2018.

Know what and who you are dealing with, they do not care about you. Just about the sale.  Once you sign, they no longer care what they sold you, it's your fault they think for you buying a lemon.  Do yourself a favor  and look else, safe yourself the hassle. Not worth it."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"Thanks to everyone's reviews on here. The guys here are very professional and kind. I would recommend them to anyone. 

Thank you to the guys who worked on my car and the guys who worked on it. 

I can't imagine how many people you would have known about a car repair shop. I know I can trust these guys with my car. I'd rather go to a more reputable shop. 

Thank you so much.This is a great place to get your car washed. The staff is friendly and helpful. I got a great deal and a great wash. I'll be back.Do not buy a car from this dealership. We bought a car from them and it was a nightmare. We went in to look at a car and it was a very low mileage car. We went to look at a vehicle we saw online and we had no idea what we were talking about. We went back and asked to see the car. We were told the car was there and ready to go. We drove off with the car. The salesman would not return the car and ask us to look at"
Automotive,2.5,CG,The worst customer experience ever! We have been dealing with these people for years and have never been treated so poorly by them. The people are rude and they have no customer service skills whatsoever. We had to take our car in for a simple oil change. They said it would take 30 minutes. We waited 2 hours for them to tell us that the car was not ready for pick up. They didn't tell us about the car until we were on our way. We are very disappointed. We will NEVER come back to this dealership. They will rip you off and charge you for unnecessary services. We will never go back.I have used this parking service twice.  The first time I was in the area and the second time was to get an estimate for the cost of an alignment.  I was given a quote and the wait time was almost an hour.  I paid the $25.00 for the alignment and was told that my tires were bald.  I asked for a price of $80.00 and they said they would call me back.  I waited another hour and no call.  I called the next morning
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I live in Winter Springs (north of Orlando) and also have a house in Pinellas Park that I visit often.  I discovered this car wash when it first opened and was charging $3 for a basic wash. What a great deal- their rotating brushes are cloth, and it would clean every square inch of my new Kia Sorento.  Price went up to $4 in '21, but still a good deal- I'd wait to wash my car until I came down here from Winter Springs, otherwise I'd hand-wash it.  But upon arriving here for New Year's Day '22, I was disappointed to find the business closed and it has stayed closed past the Holiday.  I'm not sure if it was closed earlier ('cause I wasn't here) but I will be sad if it doesn't reopen again soon.  I'm wondering if they've not been able to pay employees enough to keep them from staying at home waiting for the government hand-out or what?!  This stay-in-your-car wash system is the best I've ever seen and the price cannot be beaten.  The blow dry at the end of the wash is strong enough to completely dry your vehicle and remove some of your older decals.  The self-serve vacuums are only so-so.  It's a good deal though and I hope they open again soon."
Automotive,3.0,OR,I got a car but not very satisfy with my payment. The bank tells you what they want from you and there is no way you can change it or fight it. They always win. The car was over price by 500 dollars and Tyler said that their was no way they can bring the price down that they have a no hassle price. Because of my interest being so high I ended up not buying the extended warranty that I wanted to buy. Again the nu hassle deal. They don't detail the cars like they supposed to but good thing I have a wife that knows how and now looks like new in the inside. We are having some issues with the car and I understand they are taking care of these issues but the worst part on is that the driver side heater not working and with this weather it really needs it. They need to check the cars better before they sale them. One last thing the car I got has hail damage on the top and they told me that they won't fix it because it is a use car. I don't know if that was the reason why the car was 500 over priced. It was not a 3000 car it was a 25000 car so why can't they fix it.
Automotive,3.0,CG,"For a few days my car broke down and I called Tires Plus and they got me right in.  They had the best prices and took care of me in a matter of minutes.  They had me in and out in less than 2 hours.  I was shocked how fast they were going to repair my car!  I'm very happy and thankful to have found this place.  I will recommend them to anyone I know!I recently purchased a brand new Tacoma from Chapman Ford and have had nothing but problems with the service department.  They lied about what was happening and why it needed to be fixed.  When I was driving home from work, the check engine light came on and I stopped at the dealership to see if they could fix the issue.  I had an appointment for 3 pm and I was told that they were not going to do the work until the next day.  After the third time, I called Chapman and was told that they were not going to do the work.  I had to take my truck back to the dealership to have the service department redo the problem.  They told me that I"
Automotive,4.5,CG,"So happy to find this shop. The guys here are knowledgeable, friendly, and the prices are affordable. If you want to get your car fixed right the first time, take it here.The customer service is excellent.  I am very pleased with the service provided by the staff at the dealership.  I have purchased 2 cars from them and have never had an issue.  They will make sure you understand what they are doing and what they will do to get you in the car you want to purchase.  I have recommended them to several friends and family.  They are the best and most professional and courteous.  I have been in contact with the dealership about the car and I am very happy to have found them.  They have the best service and I would highly recommend them to anyone!I have been bringing my car here for about a year now. I have had a few minor issues that have been resolved in the past with some of the other dealerships. My wife and I have taken all of our cars here for service and they have always been very friendly and accommodating.
I have taken our cars to them"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a car and decided to see a Honda Pilot. We were able to get the car we wanted, but they didn't have the color we were looking for. They had no clue where the car was, and told us it was still available. The salesman was a bit rude to us, and we felt like we were inconveniencing him. After asking for a different salesman to assist us, we were told he was ""too busy"" and that he could come in to help us, but no one was available. We called him up, and he told us it was a different salesman that was going to try and help us. We were on the phone for about 30 minutes, and the other salesman went over to the dealership to ask for a manager. We ended up leaving, with no choice but to go to another Honda dealer in the area. We had no choice but to wait for another Honda dealer.

We ended up buying a Honda Pilot from Honda of Wesley Chapel. We had such a great experience and felt so much better about it than we had been with Honda. We will definitely be"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"This company is the shadiest, most unprofessional, and dishonest company I have ever dealt with. They will lie to you about the cost of the vehicle, lie to you about the price of the vehicle and then lie to you about the actual price. This company is a joke. You would think a woman could have a better experience buying a vehicle. Buyer beware!These guys are great! I went there to have some work done on my truck. They took good care of me and got me in and out quickly. The work was done in a timely manner. They even cleaned my windows and windows and put a good amount of water in it too. I will be back for any work I need done on my vehicle. I'll definitely be back for any work I need done on my vehicles!I went in with a very small car with a broken front bumper. They had it for a week and the bumper was damaged. I thought it was good to go to a shop that would look at it and see what they could do. I made an appointment for the next day.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"Horrendous and deceitful service so far from the Service King at 515 East Market Street in West Chester PA. 

My daughter's was involved in an accident and her car was towed to the center yesterday evening. As of 12:00 PM today, we'd still not heard anything, so I called. I was informed by Aron that someone had called because they needed to send paperwork. I asked what number and he gave my wife's mobile number. I checked with her and she had no missed calls and no voicemails. Lie #1.

I gave my email address and asked that the paperwork be sent to me. Aron promised that it would. Lie #2.

At 4:30, I'd still not received paperwork via email so called back and got Aron again. He seemed annoyed to be getting my call and I asked whether paperwork had been sent. He went to check, came back and said they would send it again. Most likely Lie #2 told for the second time, as it hadn't been sent in the first place. Lie #3 - I still have not received an email from Service King and it is now 9:35 PM. 

My daughter is a student and cannot afford to rent a car indefinitely, even though 80% is covered by insurance, so I need to resolve this situation quickly for her.

What a disappointment Service King has been so far."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"This pep boys has seriously almost killed my boyfriend and I. We had them do a check up on our Honda and do inspection and when we got the car back all seemed fine. We were driving up 95 and the car started shaking. It was so scary so we pulled over and thankfully there was a tow truck in the lot we were in. 4 OF THE 5 BOLTS ON OUR TIRES WERE SO LOOSE AND THE TIRES ALMOST FLEW OFF THE CAR. This is not a joke or exaggeration. This pep boys needs to be closed, inspected, have their employees fired and start new. They are going to kill their customers. 

AND THIS ISN'T THE ONLY THING. We took our 15 passenger van there for state inspection and they told us we needed new brakes and roaters and it cost us $700+. Guess what! THEY INSTALLED THEM INCORRECTLY! They began to rust and crack and the car was making a terrible noise. We had it taken to another mechanic and they had to replace all the brakes and fix the damaged parts. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY THIS PEP BOYS IS. It's so unsafe to have employees who do this. ALSO ITS ILLEGAL AND WE ARE GOING TO GET THE POLICE INVOLVED BECAUSE IT'S FRAUD. 

Close this location, or have their customers killed. I am not joking."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I set an appointment to turn in my leased truck with Irma and explained to her that I was going to be short on time. When I showed up for my appointment, Leo was waiting for me the minute I pulled up. He greeted me as my salesperson with a smile and a handshake, even offered me a drink and a snack. I instantly felt good about working with him. I am a hard negotiator as I am in sales myself and Leo and his manager Bruno handled it like true professionals! Leo is not your ""typical"" car salesman as I never felt pressured once! I will give your contact info to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle! 

I dreaded going into financing as this is usually the most boring part of the whole transaction. Zac made it a blast. We were in and out of there in no time, cracking jokes the whole way through! 

Tyler delivered us the truck and explained the technology inside and out. Asking questions, I never felt like my questions were dumb or repetitive even though I'm sure they were! Tyler answered them all with ease and knowledge. He even took the car to the detail shop when my wife noticed a small scratch on the door. 

Thank you Leo, Bruno, Zac, and Tyler. You all have made this process enjoyable and pleasant."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"So, a few years ago we were looking for a new Jeep Wrangler 4 Door, but it had to be white. After searching around, we find one at Eastgate, I called and told the salesman we would be there that evening and would probably buy it, he promised to hold it for us. We get there after work see the Jeep and we like it, then a salesman comes out and tells us someone just bought it, not us. So, we left and ended up finding another on at Dellen and worked a better price. Forward to the present time. I've been wanting a SRT Jeep Cherokee and just looking and watching. We happened to be near Shadeland and against my better judgement I decided to stop in. We were walking around and browsing and a salesman come out. I ask if he had any SRT Grand Cherokee's and he says no, so I ask if they have a Trackhawk, he says no. Then he tells me I would have to travel to another state, somewhere south, to even find one. So we left. About a week later, we are on 96th street and find the SRT Grand Cherokee I've been wanting at Indy Cars and Trucks and we bought it, PS my buddy bought a Trackhawk from Tom OBrien just Incase someone else wants one they have more."
Automotive,3.0,CG,Just had an amazing car buying experience at the dealership. I will definitely be buying my next vehicle from here. Great job!I am a very loyal customer and have had great experiences with this dealership. I have been in the market for a new car for several weeks and was very interested in getting a used car for a fair price. I had a very good experience with salespeople and finance managers. I had to leave a lot of time on my mind and a lot of frustration. I was very happy with my purchase and would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a car.I had a great experience with AutoNation Nissan. The sales team was very helpful and very helpful. The whole team was very helpful and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a Nissan. Thanks again!The worst car wash I've ever been to. Not a good deal. There are so many cars on the lot that have not been washed. I've been to several locations and this one is not the best. They just seem to have a lot of cars with dirt left on them and it's very bad. I was there at least once a month and
Automotive,1.5,OR,"WOW. The attendant working the ground floor exit window was INCREDIBLY RUDE. I placed a reservation with Spot Hero. Since it's pre-paid, I had to show my reservation ticket on my phone, along with the physical ticket to an attendant to exit the parking garage. I walk over to the window and a man was leaned back in his chair, on his phone with earphones in. I waved, said ""hi, excuse me"" and tried to get his attention. He didn't look up. So I tapped his window. And he goes beserk. Literally, shouting at me, asking why I did that. I asked, ""I'm sorry? Did what"" He loudly knocked on his window. ""THAT. Why did you do that?"" I explained to him that I tried to get his attention but he didn't hear me with his earphones in, so I knocked. He preceded to chastise me,"" Don't worry about my earphones!"" And telling him once again, ""You couldn't hear me because of your earphones. like that's why I tapped on the window. ""

I'd rather and will pay extra for another farther spot and walk than park here again. I don't have to deal with this kind of overacting unpleasantry. I'm sorry if he had a bad day. I get it, it happens. And things build up. the tiniest thing can make people snap. But you work a service where you're interacting with customers."

Automotive,4.0,OR,"Had a very good experience at this dealership. First there weren't a bunch of salespeople in your face the second you walked in the door. we had to actually go to a receptionist and ask to have someone assist us.

Then came Karen Newland. Sales lady. I wasn't sure about her right off the bat, but she turned out to be absolutely amazing. She addressed all our questions, she was incredibly well informed and knowledgable about the vehicles, their history etc.

I can honestly say that Karen was responsible for us becoming a Dreyer & Reinbold customer.

As always in the beginning of any relationship things seem peachy keen, and I hope thats how it goes. I will definitely update this post as we explore after care and service, that is the real measure of a car dealer once the deal is closed if they continue to be awesome or not.

As of now I would definitely recommend that if your interested in an Infinity stop in and see Karen Newland she will work with you to get you into the vehicle your looking for!

Also her manager i forget his name was very awesome and friendly and not in a fake way like so many car dealers. They all seemed very genuine and interested in developing long lasting relationships wit they customers.

The entire experience at Dreyer & Reinbold Infiniti was a fun and positive one."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I live in Oregon and was traveling through Reno when my Honda Pilot had some issues. I was very concerned as I had three kids in the car and was a long way from home. I looked for the nearest Honda dealership and found Bill Pearce Courtesy Honda.  I called them early on a Monday morning to see if they could help. I spoke with Pedro from the service department. They were extremely busy but managed to squeeze my car in for a service. The car needed a new alternator and I had to wait a day for them to get the part which was under warranty. Pedro helped me get a car from a local rental car company for the day and continued with my repair. The next day, my Honda Pilot was ready and I was back on the road.  I can't speak highly enough about the friendly staff, courteous team and outstanding service I received.  I even got a follow up call the next day from Pedro to make sure I got back to Oregon ok and that the car was running as expected. Being in a new place trying to find a reputable place to help with a car having issues can be incredibly daunting but the team at Bill Pearce made it a easy as can be!  I would highly recommend them!"

Automotive,3.0,CG,"I recently researched and then decided to go with the third party. 

The first time we went we had the best experience, and they took the time to explain what we wanted to do and made sure we were taken care of. 

We will be back for our next vehicle.I had a great experience here. I had a flat tire and needed to get it fixed quickly. I had to leave my car there for two days because it was making a strange noise. They were able to get me in right away, and they fixed it at a great price. When I needed it back, they had it back to me in less than an hour! I will definitely be going back here and recommending them to anyone I know. I can't recommend them enough!If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I was going to buy my car and I was on a trip and the car was making a weird noise.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"This review is related to the service department. I called in advance to see if I needed an appointment for an oil change. I was told that I did not need an appointment and was advised to come in that afternoon before 4:00pm. In that case, my wait would not be long. I drove over 20 miles to get there and arrived at 2:30pm. I was looking forward to getting the service and also spending time looking at new Jeeps on the lot. I was interested in looking at the Rubicons.

I was not pleasantly greeted at the service department. The service technician's first words were to ask me if I had an appointment. I said that I did not have an appointment and told him that I was told that it was not necessary. He said that whoever told me that was wrong and that I would have to wait 3 to 4 hours for the oil change. I told him that I was not willing to wait that long and expressed my disappointment with the situation. He said that was too bad and advised me to wait for a moment while he moved a car so that I could leave. No effort was made toward creating a good customer experience.

As the saying goes, ""You only get one chance to make a good first impression"". This place failed miserably in that regard."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I had to write this to warn others about the horrible experiences I've has over the past 11 years with the 2 toyota's I purchased from this dealership. I usually do a quick inspection of the work that is done when I get the car back. Here is a short list of what they did wrong over the past 11 years. 1) The radiator was recalled, they replaced it and did not put the top bolts in to hold it in place. I paid for a transmission flush, it was not done. On one oil change I noticed the oil filter was not changed, Met with the service manager, he agreed it was not done. They have overfilled the Oil about 7 times in 8 years on my 2nd car. The most recent was I had a torn steering rod boot replaced, the knucklehead mechanic forgot to put the clip on the boot, after he had already put the tie rod end on, so he put a small tie wrap on instead. This is just what I can remember off the top of my head. They need to start inspecting the substandard work some, or all their mechanics are doing, and fire the incompetent ones.
The problem most people don't understand is, substandard work can lead to cascading failures of other components, and you will never know the root cause was incompetent service."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Ok, I have mixed feelings about this place. 

1. When I got home, I noticed that the floor mats had not been vacuumed or wiped down. The floor mats were still dirty. 
2. I had to clean them myself and vacuum the floor mats myself. 
3. When I got home, I noticed that the mats had not been vacuumed. I called the corporate office and they said it was only a ""toy"" and they would have it taken care of for a few hours. 
4. When I got home, the front windows still had dirt all over the floor mats. 
5. When I went to leave, I found that they never even vacuumed my car. 

6. I contacted the owner and was told that he would have it done by the end of the day. I called the next day, he said that the car was ready and I would be right back. I left a message and called back the next day. He never called back. I called back, so I called back again and told him that he was told him that I would be there"

Automotive,4.0,OR,I was forced to cross paths with Embassy not by choice but because they're the 3rd party servicer to the interlock company I decided to go with. Months go by my vehicle needed a new radiator to pass emissions and rear shocks unfortunately my mechanic was out of town and was foolish enough to let Embassy convince me they're a full service shop...ya right!!! For 2 weeks I was fed lies about the status everytime I called in because good luck on them returning a phone call come to find out they didn't have the equipment needed to do the emissions part of the job they quoted me in the first place. The worst part was not having to pay for taxi rides to work and grocery store while my car was hi jacked but while my vehicle was in there possession they tripped violations that led harassing collections call from the company that reports on my interlock and nobody at Embassy bothered to inform them it was there fault and these are the guys that service the interlock you'd think they'd be smart enough to at least do that much. I had to clear everything up between tweedle dee and tweedle DUMB. Please take my advice these people are dishonest lack integrity and looking to turn a quick buck on you... When you see Embassy don't turn and walk away RUN AWAY!!!!
Automotive,2.5,OR,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! THE LIFETIME WARRANTY IS A JOKE. THEY RUINED MY WINDOWS WITH THEIR CRAPPY TINT JOB! I took my brand new 2012 buick lacrosse here to get the windows tinted. Seriously 30 miles on it. Now three years later the tint is so bubbly you cant see through it. They're supposed to have a ""lifetime warranty"" so I called.  The person who answered the phone told me that I was the sixth person with the same problem and apparently there was a defect with the glue used. I told the guy I couldnt locate my reciept, would they be able to locate a copy in their system. He said he would look and call me back. I asked him how much it would cost if he couldnt find a copy of my reciept. He quoted me $180 just to have the tint removed because apparently the glue is super strong, oh and there is a good possibility the removal will ruin the rear defogger because they may have to take a razor blade to it to scrape off the tint. I paid $200 to get the crappy tint put on in the first place. Long story short guy never called me back and Im currently looking for real professionals who may be able to make it so I can see behind me again without ruining the defogger."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I honestly could not have picked a better dealership to have my first car buying experience. My parents and I were greeted (not to mention, complimented) at the door by Kyle. Kyle found out why we were there and introduced us to Josh, who was a pleasure to work with. Josh answered any and all of our questions, was honest, and very well educated on the vehicle that I was interested in. He was also very patient and went above and beyond to work with my budget and help me get the car that I wanted. Kyle also kept us entertained throughout the negotiation process, which was really cool. They were both so easy to talk to, and made my family and I feel special and well taken care of. Anthony wrapped up the financial end of the deal, and also was very helpful and answered all of the questions that we asked him. When I walked away from the dealership (actually, drove away in a pretty sweet rental car) that day, I felt confident and comfortable with the milestone purchase that I had just made. As much as I have told my friends and family about my brand new car, I have told them equally about the impressive service that I received at Newton Nissan. I will definitely be a return customer and will reccomend these guys to my friends and family!"

I went there to pick it up and the salesman told me it was sold out of state and it was in Texas. I went back to the dealership, they had it for two days. When I went to pick it up, the salesman was super nice and not pushy. I had a bad day, but the manager, Justin, helped me get the car. Justin made sure I was comfortable, and also went out of his way to make sure I got a good deal. I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a car.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"Went to Pep Boys in Tampa to get an oil change.  The guy who helped me said he doesn't have the best oil, but he could have a better price.  I was there for an hour and half.   The guy told me he doesn't have the most expensive oil, but he's a great guy.  

I walked out and went to get my oil changed.  I was there for an hour and half and a half, so I can't believe I was there for the 2 hours.  

I got the oil change, and went to get my oil changed.  The guy at the counter asked if I had any questions, I said yes and got out to my car.  I walked out to my car and saw my oil cap was missing, the manager said it was on the wrong side.  I asked him what was wrong and he said ""nothing.""  I asked him if he had the proper oil and he said, ""you know what, we have to put it in it, it is on wrong"".   I told him I told him that I had to go back"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"I have been an Acura owner for almost 4-years and have received EXCELLENT service from the Service Dept., however, working with the Sales office over the past 2-3 weeks has been extremely disappointing.

I drive an RDX and have decided I need a larger vehicle.  I went the the Acura dealership and was able to view (not sit in or drive) the 2022 MDX and fell in love!  I called back a few days later to inquire about a test drive and was told there will be a couple of MDX coming in, in November, but most have non-refundable deposits on them.  I asked if I can make the deposit, with an exception to have it refunded, if I don't like the car and was told flat out NO.  The Sales guy went on to explain they don't need to make exceptions like that because there is so much demand for the MDX.  He was kind but the underlining statement is that Acura doesn't need my business, there's always another customer.  
It's really sad that Acura makes claim to the ""Acura Family"" and taking care of repeat customers but when it came down to it, they don't stand by their statement.  
I really do love the look of the 2022 MDX and may ultimately still purchase the car but now I'm looking around at other products as well."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Dropped car off to have oil changed and had a headlight out.  Asked to have headlight bulbs changed on both sides to avoid another trip soon. Got the car back and the headlight that was out went out again on first use. Called back and was told to drop it off again, it may be a loose wire. Wife called in and was told a different story. Mike told her the drivers side was a tight fit and he had a hard time with it but he got it to turn on. When asked why he didn't call when there was a problem. He said he don't test drive stuff that works. It worked until I drove it at night and tried to use it. Grrr. Haven't  dealt with an alley mechanic like him in a long time. He even quoted a price to fix it being a bad connector at $84. Well my wife replaced both headlight assemblies with new for $150. This place would have me keep coming back to nickle  and dime me . Bottom line ,  Telling me it was a loose wire and telling my wife it had a bad connector that needed replacement and giving her a price quote over the phone knowing what was wrong but still sending it home as repaired. Just watch your back and tighten your wallet up  ;)"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"You know those stories about what happens when you drive a car? 

The person who worked on my car had a bad attitude. He then said ""Oh, you should go to the Honda Dealership and get a free oil change."" I told him I was waiting for the coupon and he said ""well, I did get a free oil change."" I was so offended that I didn't get a free oil change. I asked him if I could get a free oil change from him. He said he couldn't. I asked why he couldn't give me a free oil change and he said that he couldn't give me a free oil change.

Automotive,5.0,OR,"I am so glad I read all of the Yelp reviews to discover Super Value Smog because this place was excellent--particularly for the cost and service--believe me, you will be making the right choice.  I could not believe how affordable this place was compared to almost everywhere else in the nearby vicinity.  Not to mention, I was in and out in no more than 10 minutes and only paid $34 cash.  I believe it is a little more if you pay with a credit card, but it's still more cost effective than the competition.

Since I just moved to the area, I had no idea how long this test would take and didn't know how the process goes, but it was thankfully hassle free.  I pulled in the small driveway, the employee told me where to park my car, and requested me to leave the keys inside.  He then asked me the year of my car and asked if I was paying in cash or with a card. I filled out the necessary paperwork while he hooked my car up to be tested...and a few mins later he said ""You passed!""  Went to the register to pay, he gave me a receipt as proof for the DMV, and let me know that I will need to do this every two years in California.  I highly recommend Super Value Smog!!!"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"STAY AWAY FROM HERE. If you're a single woman looking for a place to take your car, DO NOT GO HERE. Employee Glen and Owner Guy are sweet as pie until they GET YOUR MONEY. Today I picked up my BMW to the tune of $1200 for tests and ignition coils. 
After leaving the lot and getting 10 miles away, I noticed that my turn signals were not automatically switching off (like they used to BEFORE I brought it in). I called in immediately. I explained my situation, and Glen turned into a raging monster (was the nicest guy on the planet a day ago), told me I was ""calling him a liar"" and that ""he didn't think I had the money to repair anything else"", and claimed that they ""already knew that was happening"". Then he actually and blatantly hung up me.

I felt like his remarks were RACIST, DISRESPECTFUL, MISLEADING, and plain rude.
I had to call back to speak with the owner, Guy. He had a little more empathy but wasn't much better, oh but he DID offer me the opportunity to bring it back in to get worked in again! Unbelievable.
Being a business owner myself, the fact that Guy keeps people like Glen on his staff is one thing; everyone know there's a little shade in every mechanic, but to defend him and actually expect someone to give them MORE money????

STAY CLEAR AWAY."

Automotive,4.0,OR,"David and his crew have done an outstanding job of detailing the interior and exterior of my little Mini Cooper S. I had some doubts because his web site didn't have a lot of before and after pictures, but when I saw my car after it was done, I couldn't stop smiling, just like his web site said. In fact, the first words out of my mouth were ""Holy sh*t!!!!"" with my eyes popping out of my sockets. My car definitely looks better than when I first drove it out of the dealership. About a year ago, an idiot woman in an SUV sideswiped my Mini just as I left my dealership for a yearly inspection. She scratched up my rear leftside wheel rim pretty bad. David and his crew made the scratches disappear. A few months ago, I drove down a little side street and another idiot had his car parked a little too far from the curb. My side mirror on the passenger side violently turned in and scraped against the window leaving some gloss coat on the window. That stain also was pretty much gone after David's detailing. There are only minor things, such as a little dust here and there and fuzzies left by cloth rags caught on the edges of an emblem or crevice, but these are easily fixable/removable. All in all, an excellent job and I will definitely return again."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"There's always going to be a line, no two ways about it. Bring a book/work to pass the wait. There's usually a person at the entrance, with whom you check in with to ""register"" for whatever it is you're there to get done. You're given a number and then all you need to do is wait for your number/name to get yelled out for you to enter. Some people wait in their car if they're number is still far off, but usually there are folks waiting outside the entrance, off to the side, so as to ensure not to miss their number/spot being called. 

Once inside, there's another small waiting area and 3-4 windows. It's pretty straightforward once you're in. The husband and I were able to get our driver's licenses, car registrations, new plates, and register to vote. 

Pro tip - it's usually cheaper to pay for several years of registration if you're able to swing it! They're usually tell you the different options in price. 

Also, I didn't know this until afterwards, but it's an extra $50 for a""vanity"" plate that isn't the standard AZ plate. 

Lastly, AZ has about a million different plate options, which is interesting and also a good way (if you need a license plate) to spend your time perusing while waiting for your number to be called. 

Overall, we appreciate the overall painless experience at Arizona Motor Vehicle Express."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Took my car here today for the first time. EXTREMELY disappointed on paying $119 for an interior clean and the inside of my car looks terrible! Many places NOT CLEANED AT ALL and it apparently was vacuumed and looks like it was NEVER DONE! What a JOKE/SCAM! I am completely shocked at how badly this was done - for $119 I was under the assumption it would be a very thorough clean and I was paying for a good service.

Rubber floor mats: wet with water only - still dirty NOT washed/scrubbed

Doors: drivers side door cleaned, passenger and one of back doors not cleaned AT ALL

Carpets: still full of dirt 

Back Seats: not vacuumed; all dirt and crumbs still all over

Console: interior not cleaned and full of dirt

Some surfaces have protectant on it and many areas clearly don't as you can see the colour/shine difference?

GPS Screens: dirty, not even wiped!!!!!!! 

They said it would take 45 mins to an hour and it was done in 18 minutes which I thought was amazing as it was fast however it makes sense now why so much wasn't done or why it wasn't done PROPERLY as they rushed!

Will be contacting the manager and posting their response as for the money this is unacceptable. It looks like it was done by a child and how can they physically give a customer their keys back knowing how bad a job they did?"
Automotive,3.5,CG,AutoZone serves a purpose BUT this place is the worst. I will never ever go there again and will be sure to warn others. The guys that work there are not nice at all. The only reason I gave them one star is because they were busy. This is my first time ever going there.I had a great experience purchasing a car from here and it was a smooth transaction. They did not pressure me into anything I didn't need. The sales people were super helpful and very helpful. I had a couple of questions about my car and they helped me with everything.

I spoke with a salesman, Jimmy Trieste, who talked about the features of the X5 and invited me to come in for a test drive. I explained that I was calling from Los Angeles and was looking for a vehicle to tow by boat with. He send me a very informative email which included all the details of the X5 as well as additional photos. I noticed at the bottom of his email that he sold Audi as well as BMW. I called and said I didn't suppose he had any Audi Q8s. He told me one had just arrived that very morning. I was so excited because that's my absolute favorite SUV! Jimmy was so unbelievably easy to deal with. My friend drove me to Santa Barbara the next day and Jimmy had everything ready! No waiting at all. That's a first for me when purchasing a car. Darouny in the finance department was so nice as well! She was totally prepared and again, no stress. Finally, Chad, their product specialist showed me around my beautiful new Q8 and got me comfortable with how everything worked. Without a doubt, my next purchase will be with the Santa Barbara Auto Group"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I needed a replacement windshield which took about an hour. The online booking procedure is super easy & accurate. Do a search for coupon codes and you're likely to find at least 20% off. If you have them come to you, it's a $25 up-charge and there is a non-negotiable $9 disposal fee on any replacement. For my experience, the receptionist was very nice. The 63123 location has a clean & spacious waiting room with coffee, a restroom, and basic kids' stuff. Everything seemed a-okay when I picked up my truck. I never met the technician but the the receptionist told me ""As a courtesy we vacuumed your vehicle & cleaned the windows."" By ""windows"" I think she meant ""new windshield"" because my other windows had smudges that weren't there before. And by ""vacuumed"" I think she meant ""didn't vacuum"". I keep my truck meticulous. I found dust & a few tiny glass pieces on my center console & cup holders. You might be thinking I didn't vacuum my truck after the windshield originally shattered. Wrong; I detailed it immediately after I got off the highway that day. Lastly, I found the dashboard photo-sensor (sunlight detector bubble) was cracked & knocked off its post. Now I don't NEED the courtesies listed above. But don't tell me you did it if you really didn't. Had it not been for these three anomalies, I would've given them 5 stars."

After 2 hours I was told it would be another 2 hours.  After two hours I was told they would not do my inspection and it would be another hour and a half to complete.  I was told that the inspection was not completed and that they did not have a tech in the service department to check the oil.  I was told that I needed to bring it back in to get a second opinion.  They said that they would take a look at it.  It took another 2 hours for them to take the car to my mechanic.  I was told that I had to take it in to have the oil changed.  I have no idea how this could have happened.  I was told that the oil was not changed in the service department.  I had to take the car back in to have the oil changed.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"This week was the second time I went to OTC.  Requested a carb replacement, specifically saying NOT to clean the carb, and turn signal bulb.  Without authorization phone call they did another carb clean instead of the replacement.

Why do they still have a high star rating?  Because of the customer service.  As I said before, the owner is an amazing guy.  He was in New York on business, but his employee rang him up and after the initial anger settled, he agreed to a minimal charge on the cleaning so the bike could be riden around.  The employee, though lacking empowerment, took all the necessary steps to reconcile the situation.

He explained that he does not have a contact with Kymco, and therefor cannot order parts for their scooters.  However, he recommended that we can buy one online and they can install it.  

Obviously not what I exactly wanted to hear, but he and his employee did a great job of handling a poor situation.  This has not detured me from going back to this shop.

On a side note, they have moved since the first time I went.  When I dropped off the bike this week, it was only the second day they were at their new location - which might explain the confusion.  They are across the street, their parking lot is ajoining the Thorntons gas station.."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"After a previously pleasant experience and an unfortunate total loss accident, I went back to Team Toyota to replace my (now totaled) 2013 Camry. I purchased the same car color and trim, a 2014.5 XLE. Unfortunately, this car has had two issues and the dealer has done nothing to rectify the issue, telling me to ""come back to service"" again and again, three times so far. My first issue was a loud clattering in the trunk area (passenger side). This has not been resolved. Despite a replacement of the headliner foam and the license plate foam, this has done nothing to resolve the issue and the technicians apparently do not understand that the sound is coming from the trunk's passenger side, not the headliner, and not the license plate.

Additionally, the plastic covering the steering wheel column came off while I was driving, impairing my ability to hit the brake and nearly causing a serious accident.

The incompetence of the service techs at the dealership is truly astonishing, and while dealership employees and management are all nice when you come in to purchase the vehicle, the dealership will not take responsibility after they make the sale, will not stand behind what they sell, and will be downright mean to you. My advice would be to look elsewhere and to a dealership that actually values your business, not only prior to sale but after. Do not buy from this terrible dealership."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Went with Coast to Coast because I wanted to deal directly with a family run carrier not a broker. Paid a little more then the lowest online quotes, but it was worth it. Service was great from the initial call to request a quote to the delivery. Very friendly and helpful, very professional, very good at keeping us informed as to status and estimated pick up and delivery. Picked up our car on time, driver (Norwin) got rave reviews from my mom when he picked the car up, and he could not have been better when we picked it up; polite, friendly, informative. Great experience; I would definitely use them again and not hesitate to recommend them. 

When I first started looking at companies, I found mostly brokers that hook you up with a carrier. I also found out that on the big auto transportation review site, there are paid reviews, and the carriers can remove unfavorable ones. If you contract with a broker, and there is damage to your car, you deal with the carrier, not the broker.

That's why I went directly to Coast to Coast; they have their own trucks and drivers, if there's a problem you deal directly wit them. I also assumed a family run business would be more responsive to an individual customer.

Car was picked up and dropped off on time, in perfect condition, with great service. Doesn't get any better than that."

Automotive,3.5,OR,"I went in the other day for a standard oil change and a tire rotation. The manager Mike told me that I didn't need a tire rotation and that I need a brake fluid change instead. One I got it done I drove away thinking everything was golden. Within a few days I noticed that my brake light was on as if my parking brake was engaged. I parked my car for 2 days and went on a trip and when I returned I noticed some fluid by my back wheels. I opened the hood I looked at the brake fluid reservoir and I was just about empty. You could image that I was pissed as hell. I went back to Firestone and asked for Mike the manager, and told him that ""you sold me the brake fluid change and that you will fix it"" he said ok. It only took 15 minutes and he had 5 guys working on it. When it was completed all he said was ""thank you."" He didn't even apologize for almost killing me, didn't offer any compensation for my troubles. Not even a simple ""sorry"" 

I don't not recommend anyone going to Firestone on Clearview. They obviously don't car about there customers well being this place is a shit hole full of half rate ass workers who don't know what they are doing. I will never be back and no one should either."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Let me start by saying I have had such a terrible string of experiences here that I felt the need to let the public aware. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. 

Bought my car here, what I was ""sold"" in the morning and what I agreed to by the end of the day was totally different(they pulled the whole ""after he commits, keep him here for hours and slowly bleed all the money you can out of him"" trick). The day started with Jay, the sales manager, making the deal sweeter and sweeter since I wouldn't say yes on the spot; I said I wanted to think about it overnight. Eventually it became an excellent deal that I was willing to take on the spot.  But then, they took advantage of a first car buyer excited to have his first new car and kept me there for six hours  , slowly taking away all aspects that made it a great deal. Granted, it's not entirely their fault that I was too naïve to know better. Also, they promised me free oil changes for my entire lease- then asked me if I had it in writing when I went to schedule my first one (they didn't honor - oil changes cost $70 and tire rotation was another $34 on top of that). 

Every time I've serviced my vehicle here it's taken 2+ hours. For an oil change....

Hamilton Honda is much better."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I brought my Dodge Ram promaster in for service after my engine died (20k miles on the motor). I bought the vehicle used with an 80,000 mile factory power train warranty. Staff at the dealership was friendly. However, they misdiagnosed my engine failure, I am guessing because they don't want to do warranty work, and told me that it was my fault the engine overheated (even though the vehicle had sat dormant for 3 days, and had been driven less than 1/2 a mile when it failed). They told me it would be $7000 for a new motor and they had no idea when they could get one because they were on back order. I paid to have it towed to another dealership near where I live on the east coast of Florida. Within 2 days they told me there was a hole in the piston, which is a manufacturer defect and covered under warranty. They also told me that they would have a new motor in t within a week. Either the service department at Dayton Andrews either misdiagnosed my engine failure and is completely incompetent OR they were to lazy to work on a warranty claim and tried to screw me out of a factory warranty. Either way DONT bring your vehicle in for service here. Also, at this point, I had driven the vehicle less than 500 miles. So don't buy the eco diesel from dodge."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Be very careful.  If you have a bone stock car with all original emissions equipment, you're probably fine to go to GM, but if not, I would not go there.  I had an aftermarket catalytic converter on my  car that has passed smog test for years until I came to GM.  He flunked me even though the car passed all the emissions tests with flying colors.  He failed it because one number in the catalytic converter serial number wasn't what he thought it should be.  I ended up going to the DMV Smog Referee in Oxnard where the DMV tester looked at me and said ""Why in the heck didn't he pass you?""  I shared the story with him. He just shook his head, looked the cat up in the DMV web site, saw it as an approved cat, tested it to confirm and then handed me the paperwork that I had passed.  I ultimately got my emissions approved but I had to go through all that time, expense and travel to Oxnard to get it. All of this could have been avoided had GM known where to look it up in the DMV web site.  I hate to give them this bad of a review but it was a lack of knowledge, expertise or both that ended up costing me a lot of time and effort to get resolved."

This was not the case with the service department. I was very upset that they would have to get my car back to me, but they did not. They just wanted to make a sale and not fix my car. I don't want to go to a dealership, but I do want to know how to get it fixed. I will take my business elsewhere and do not recommend this place. My advice is to stay away from this place.

My 2018 Ford Escape was here almost 2 months for warranty repair work.
I got it back after month and had it less than a day but realized the check engine light was back on they fixed it on the spot the next day and then it started 2 days later it was putting out white smoke out of the exhaust and took it back because it started burning oil, so they had it for another 2 weeks and after I get it back and drive it through the rain and both body panels that protect the undercarriage of the car fell off and said they we're zip tied back on by me at one point and that's why they fell down but its funny me and my mechanic where under this car before I bought it there was no zip ties holding anything on so that was a lie and this is the only dealership/shop it's ever been to and they said will not cover it.
This place is garbage.
They were clearly upset that they had to do warranty work and took it out on my vehicle,
They refused to fix the damage they caused and warn anyone to steer clear of these scam artists,
They literally used zip ties to fix the panels after accusing me of using zip ties?!?!?
They will be speaking with my lawyer and look forward to future litigation.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"I am overall satisfied with the car I purchased. I got a car with low milage at a good price.

My note of caution is when it comes to financing. I would recommend coming prepared with your own financing secured.

I provided the dealer with my information and SS# to shop around with various auto lenders. I had prepared by previously ordering a credit report from all 3 bureaus, including FICO scores (greater than 750). When they came back after shopping around with various lenders, I was shown a FICO score that was 70 points lower from where it was earlier in the day. The lowered score had knocked me down several tiers: one of the banks rejected my application (confirmed by a letter I received later in the mail), and I had to settle for high interest rate loan.

The next week, I reviewed my credit report again, and found that my FICO score was back to where I expected it to be. With that, I immediately refinanced my auto loan with my credit union.

I feel like my credit score was somehow watered down so I would get a jacked up interest rate on my auto loan. I should note, however, when I presented this information to the dealer, they maintained that no customer has reported a similar experience to them. Again, to be safe, my advice is to go to your bank first to secure financing before coming to the showroom."

I was then told that they would have to replace the battery. I went back to the shop and they said that they had to replace the battery and that the battery was fine.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"If you think that this yelper is a handy gal who repairs her own car, you'd be wrong.

This is an instance where I was out running errands with hubby, and he explained to me why he prefers this particular auto parts store above all others in Franklin, so since he refuses to yelp, I am sharing on behalf of his super-handy self.

Advance Auto Parts is cleaner than most other stores of its kind, and I can attest to such from the parking lot.  But hubby says that the staff here are helpful, but in a respectful, don't-treat-you-like-an-idiot way - and that's the real reason we drive past four other similar stores to go here.  Their clerks are seasoned, so if you have a question they can either answer it or have sense enough to look something up, not just spew out random info to make themselves sound and feel smart.

Some other stores in the area have clerks that consider themselves to be automotive demi-gods, and come across as rude and not really interested in what you are asking.

I can vouch for the fact that if you buy wiper blades, they're happy to install them for you.  Same goes with batteries, light bulbs, and such - and if you're a girl and not married to Mr. Wonderful like I am, that would be reason enough to visit.

So according to hubby, this is the place for the helpful automotive man."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I rated this low because I wanted to ensure that Kia of West Chester KNOWS how disappointed I am in what they did to my credit score with the unnecessary credit inquiries.  I had obtained pre-approval from Kia Motors Finance and had the documentation with me when I reported to the dealer.  I made it very clear that I was going with Kia Finance and their approved [very low] interest rate.  However, with this being told to the salesperson AND the finance department, they still made SEVERAL attempts to obtain financing with local banks.  This jumped my inquiries up significantly.
Although, I did complain, and they did write a letter to the credit bureaus stating that the inquiries were, in fact, unnecessary, and apologized, the credit bureaus would not remove the  inquiries, stating that the inquiry removal requests would need to come from the banks, themselves.  Kia of West Chester was advised of such; however, indications are that they no longer pursued working with those banks to submit those inquiry removals to the bureaus.
That said, I have no choice but to provide this rating and to warn future customers of the potential for unnecessary inquiries in situations where you already have pre-approved loans arranged.  If Kia of West Chester wishes to continue to pursue persuading the banks to remove the inquiries, and is successful in doing so, I will be glad to remove this rating."

Shysters. Tell you everything you want to hear, of course personable and friendly, cause it's their job. they really don't care about the person. They make the buying part a decent experience, until after the fact of course. Once they have your money they do not give a shit about you. They had supposedly done an inspection on the vehicle we bought before selling it to us, but of course we found issues almost right away. Trying to get them to fix these items was the worst experience. And they were items that should've been caught in the inspection, like a broken seatbelt. Had to make numerous trips back to the dealer for these repairs and they weren't apologetic at all for the hassles. Didn't offer to reimburse gas for all the trips. Now we're finding out certain crucial info about the cars history that was not disclosed fully to us in the beginning. That info would've caused us not to buy the vehicle, but they knew that and weren't upfront. They made the info vague and now we're finding out the vehicle isn't worth nearly as much as we thought and doubt we'll be able to resell if we wanted to.

Worst car  buying experience ever. They have caused us so much stress. Don't let their personable charm fool you. These are car sales men. They're pros at being fake.

My vehicle was secured on a hydrolic lift  about foot off the ground and rocked ""violently ""for an extended amount of time. I am no sure exactly how long  it had been on that lift when I noticed it I had been there for at least 30 minutes. I was able to video it with my phone for 7 minutes. The damage was subtle at first till eventually it started running badly to the point it started cutting off when ever I came to a stop. I had my vehicle towed back to the service center which was my 2nd mistake and received a call that repairs would cost $1,000.00. Their explanation for the violent rocking of my vehicle was ""we where checking the suspension"", which is an out right lie, especially since I was not having any suspension issues. This place has no integrity!! They are out to make money at any cost, unfortunatley it is at the cost of the customer!

Automotive,3.5,OR,"We were told about The Parking Spot by my parents, whom had flown out of Nashville many times and said this was a very good company. I looked them up online and was thrilled to see that they offered car detailing. I signed up for the ultimate detail at a cost of $90 plus tax and covered parking. We arrived back in Nashville late on a Sunday evening and were tired from international flights and customs. At a glance at night our 2015 Jeep looked clean and was set out ready for us to go. The next morning after some much needed rest while unpacking bags I noticed they had not cleaned any of the upholstery head liner and the dash and all leather looked as though it had been wiped down with a dirty towel. 

Our parking for 7 days cost us $70.69 the 'Ultimate Detail' cost us $103.23. If you use their service only pay for parking, the detail work we had done was a waste of $103.23, and is how they lost 3 stars from me. 



After my initial review I was contacted by the manager. He has offered to take care of this issue by redoing the detail or reimbursing me. Due to living out of the Nashville area we agreed on a reimbursement. Not enough businesses go the extra mile to make sure they are taking care of their customers these days, but these people are! Thanks for making things right!!"

They immediately called me to confirm my appointment the next day. The same day I received another phone call advising me that they do not have my requested tires in, and they would have to special order them. Ok, no problem, although, I wish your website would have indicated that. They told me the tires would be in on Monday but to call in and confirm. Here is where I should have had my 2nd red flag; why should I have to call in and confirm; you should be calling me to confirm if you still want the business. Well, I called to confirm. They did in fact arrive. I notified them that I would be in at opening the next day. I was assured I would be taken care of right away. Well, guess again. They told me it was going to take 3-4 hours for them to get to my car. This level of customer service is not appropriate. As I walked out of the store; I received a, well call us later to reschedule.

It is a timing chain and it is going to cost $450. When I questioned the prices they said they had no intention of fixing it. I asked them to look at the timing chain and they said that the timing chain was bad and that the timing chain was bad.

 Anyway I was 4 wheeling out in Reddington when my hopefulness got in the way of my common sense and i ripped a shock off the mount and bent the crap out of my control arm. I was able to limp it back home after stopping for a much needed beer and jerky break. I took my truck to the Desert Rat on Palo Verde  after going to visit the 4 Wheel store on Speedway which is closer for me. I felt good at the Rat store, they spent time with me, gave me some nice options for a lift kit, their price was way better than my first stop. I got my lift and new taller tires, ive been back out to the same trail and I stopped and took a wiz ( can I say that on yelp ?) on the rock with the bad attitude that busted me up the last time. Overall im really happy with Desert Rat, have been back several times to drool on the hundreds of trick little goodies they have and when my my next geocashe adventure turns into $$$ im going back to do the winch, LED lights and a few other very necessary things ive been waiting for."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"There is a term as ""packing payment"". Packing is played out when a customer finances their vehicle through the dealer. It goes like this. A customer agrees to a purchase price and the dealer quotes a monthly payment approximately $20 to $40 higher than what is needed to cover the price of the vehicle. That creates a ""pack"" or room in the payment to add in the optional products. About 50%  of the customers after their commitment to buy a car have no idea that they already agreed to buy $3000-$4000 undisclosed items in additional product.
Sometimes instead of packing a deal it would be desked instead of normal 30-45 days before first payment up to 300-400 days which would increase a monthly payment 30$-$40 dollars because of the additional interest, it would make all of the products to be sold easier back in finance. Most of the deals are approved even before they are going to finance department, but instead of allowable mark up in finance reserve there would be 5-7 points mark up, again to make additional product to be sold easier. Poor customer are absolutely clueless when they get involved in that game of numbers, they have no idea of that because they were not disclosed all details of their transaction ALL INCLUDED contracts can be disputed  and renegotiated. Never deal with those predators at Reno GMC! I had to mark one star to write a review, otherwise there would be no stars."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I had a 930 am appointment for an oil change and tire rotation. When I arrived I was told it would be a 90 minute wait. It's just frustrating. I schedule my appointments early so they shouldn't be that far behind. Then after waiting I look outside to see my truck was finished. I went back to the service counter to inquire and they walked me back to the cashier who had my paperwork and keys. I don't know how long she had the keys but I wish they would have gotten me from the waiting room when it was finished. My services were covered as part of free maintenance from GM program but I would rather pay for good service than poor service and wait 2 hours. The last time I felt like they didn't care and this time they didn't even wash the truck or at least the wheels that were messy from the rotation. They did wash wash it when they did the previous oil change. 

              I tried to buy the truck from this dealership but ended up getting a much better deal an a Silverado vs their Sierra. Maybe they treat Chevy owners as second class citizens. 

               I have one year remaining for free maintenance. I am heading to a Chevy dealership next time."

They will even give you a ride if you need it.  I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for honest auto repair.  I trust them completely.I have used this parking garage twice.  The first time I was in the area and the second time was to get an estimate for the work to be done on my vehicle.  Both times I was told that I needed a new tire.  I called around and they said that they could not do the work on my vehicle because it was a used tire.  So I called the shop and they said they could do it for $70.  I asked for the estimate and was told that I needed to wait for the repairs.  and I was told that I was not to wait in the shop."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Super easy purchase.  Started by just looking- figuring out what I wanted, etc.  Salesman (Harris) very easy going.  Asked me what I wanted him to do- 1. Leave me alone to wander around and look, 2. Help me wander around and look. or 3. Show me all the models and test drive them/etc.  I chose #2 until I decided.  No need to really pitch Subaru's in general- you're either looking for one or not.  I felt the car (Crosstrek) sold itself.  If you just want a decent inexpensive car and nothing else, go buy a Hyundai/KIA across the street.

Went home after looking to think about it, called USAA for a buying certificate via TRUECAR buying service.  Immediately got several emails with offers in a general area near me.  Turned out Prestige was the best deal.  Went back to see Harris who not only honored TRUECAR price, but knocked off another $500.  No hassle. (never even used the TRUECAR certificate) Then they matched my credit union and USAA interest rates for Subaru financing.   Did everything right there and drove out in a new Crosstrek. Not even a high pressure sell from finance clerk for additional warranties. (much appreciated)

Great car, fair price, easy transaction, close to home...
Too bad other dealerships and salespersons don't follow this model for car sales, but I guess it's just a matter of philosophy and the ability of the product to sell itself."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"-------Update as of 4/25/2018.-------

The knocking sound coming from the front end of the car was not fixable and we had to have the car towed to a shop that had a ""good"" reputation. We had to take it to a shop in the same town for the same problem. We had to take it to a mechanic because it was so dangerous to drive. We had to wait 3 months for the problem to come back to the shop. We were told by the mechanic that the problem was not fixable. We had to bring the car back in for the same issue.

We had to pay for the repair. We had to pay for a rental car. We had to get the rental car back to the shop to pick up the car. The cost for the repair was $150 and we were told it would be another $200 to fix the noise. We had to take the car to a body shop to have the car repaired. The service manager told us that the noise was not fixed and that the car needed to be fixed.


We paid for the rental car to have the repairs and paid for the car to be back in the rental car and the next day. "
Automotive,2.5,OR,"In the field of automotive repair businesses, you either get: 1) Stations that cater completely to customer peace of mind and deliberately work to satisfy your needs at a fair price or 2) Stations that take their customers for granted and ask for repair costs that fetch them every single dollar in their wallet, bank account, and 501K. Firestone St. Charles Rock Road, thankfully, is not the latter.

After getting pulled over because my bumper was falling to shreds, I had to find a place for a quick fix. Mind you, this was also at 7 A.M. in the morning. On a Sunday. Most auto repair shops are closed like they're a Chik-Fil-A counterpart. Anyways, long story short, I was desperate. So, after seeing that Firestone was the lone wolf open at 8 A.M., I bet my cards and went all in.

The manager (I believe her name was Ashley) greeted me kindly and assured me they'd get it done in a jiffy. Knowing auto shops, I smirked in my head cus a ""jiffy"" could span from 1 hour to ""Yeah, I'm gonna be late for work tomorrow"". Low and behold, though, the repair only took 30 minutes and she didn't even charge me for the costs. That right there folks, is a rare species of 'Good customer service'.

Knowing that they are true to their word, friendly, and speedier than Speedy Gonzales on a good day, I can fully see myself sticking to Firestone for the rest of my auto repairs."

Also very rude by not giving you the chance to tell him anything. just steamed rolled right over you. He must not really wanted to sell a car. Tried strong-arming me into a deal that I wasn't quite ready to do. I wanted to have time to discuss it with my husband. but according to him ""it had to be done that day or my down payment would increase by $500 the next day"". I spoke with other car dealers and when I told them the story of my experience and what he tried to do they literally laughed out loud. Bank offers are usually good for 30 days. My husband is disabled and was not able to come to the dealership with me not that I needed him there I just wanted to make sure I was getting the best deal possible and was being strong-armed into strong-arming my husband into it without any discussion what so ever. Now granted I will be fair the deal on the car wasn't a bad deal but the way he treated me made me go elsewhere. Sad really. They lost my business that day and forever. I will never buy a car there.

When I started heading home, I realized they also cleaned some trash out of my car, and I noticed a few things missing. When throwing things away, they did not ask me what was okay to throw away and threw away things that were even put away in specific places. They threw away my Virginia state inspection sticker which is required for every car driving in the state of Virginia. It had fallen off of the windshield so I kept it in a compartment next to my steering wheel. They also threw away my gate access pass to my apartment which was in the same compartment. I was then stranded outside of my apartment complex not able to get in through the gate and now I have to pay a significant fee to have it replaced. These things were not left out in a place that could be mistaken for trash, so I am upset that they got thrown away. 

I understand the employees were trying to be fast, but I had already cleaned out the car more than enough for them to vacuum, and those are two very important things that now have to be replaced."

The latest example- took my car in for an oil change. They found a nail in my tire and told me i had to get a new one because it was not repairable. Fine. It's not a tire place and they had to order a tire anyways, so i left. They had put the spare on for me and threw the full size one in my trunk. On top of about 150$ of various work out supplements. Which were left broken and all over the back of my trunk. I didn't think i would have to tell people to be careful of items in the trunk. Left a voicemail and wasn't called back until 3pm today. But the manager scott, who the last time i spoke to told me he was only calling me because ""you requested i call"". Which was right when my grandmother was dying. There was no apologies.

Finally got a hold of a customer service rep who swore they would have the rest of the kit to me Saturday morning. Saturday comes and only shocks arrive again

jeep torn apart and customer service over the weekend is useless, you can order but you cant get anything fixed

1. the first order was incorrectly shipped and it was an 800$ order with the mats
2. The first contact with customer service via chat leaves a horrendous taste in an already upset person
3. The fix action was again incorrect, and will require me to ship back the extra parts
4. the car that was supposed to be ready and aligned Saturday is now down until late Tuesday at best, and i cant get another alignment appt until Friday or saturday so I lose a week of the car
5. I have little faith of getting it correct since you tried twice and failed

6. This is a new Jeep and there would have been many more orders aka lights, tops, accessories but can you tell me why I would ever order from here again?

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Do not get excessive wear and tear protection on the vehicle. They tell you that you can ding the car and get into an accident and will not need to be liable for it. THIS IS FALSE. 

Excessive wear and tear will only cover certain types of damages such as door dings, and nothing more. If someone bumps into your vehicle while it is parked, you are still responsible for that. Someone kicks your car in? You are still responsible for that.

My lease was supposed to be $290. They bumped it up by another $100 because they told me the excessive wear and tear coverage would cover everything. I agreed to do that because I lived in the city and the idea of not being liable for additional damages sounded like a great deal.

This is so false. I went in the the dealer today and they said I am responsible for all damages and excessive wear and tear is not covered. 

Additionally, at the end of the lease, I would still have to pay close to MSRP for a brand new Prius 2013. 

In short: this place is out to get you. Do not get any added coverage on the vehicle. They are just trying to get more money out of you.

 Additionally, before signing anything, ask what the payoff price for the vehicle is if you decide you want to keep it. Because they will try to screw you over that way as well.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"BUYER BEWARE!!! Do your homework, go to the dealership and make sure you are happy with the deal you got. If you want to get your car serviced at a dealership you should definitely go to Faulkner Kia in Fort Washington.I had an amazing experience with this dealership. I was greeted by a salesman named Josh and he was knowledgeable and helpful. Josh was very patient with me and I was able to get the car I wanted and on my way with a great deal. Josh went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my purchase. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a car.I recently purchased a used truck from this dealership. I had a good experience with this dealership. I was initially told by salesman I could not buy a vehicle at a certain time and it would be the next day. I was told I would have to come in and sign a paper work to sign a contract. I did not sign anything, I had to ask for a copy of the contract and they would not give me a copy of it. The dealership would not give me a copy of the contract. I called them and was very angrily and I was told by the salesman that I would not sign the contract."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"We visited Holman Infiniti to look at some of the late model, low mileage, precertified Q50s they had advertised online. Upon arriving, we were impressed by the beautiful building and the friendly staff. We were fortunate enough to have Anderson Douglas show us the car we were primarily interested in and answer all of our questions, we found him to be extremely knowledgeable about not only the Q50 but the other, non-Infinity models we were considering as well. When it came time to discuss price they were very fair, the internet price was honored (plus tax, tags, and registration fees, as expected), there were no additional, made up fees thrown in to artificially inflate the price of the car above the asking price. I have found myself sitting in many different car dealerships over the years and I can honestly say this was one of the most pleasant experiences I can remember.

We picked up the car on the Friday evening of a holiday weekend. Upon arriving home we noticed that there was no owners manual in the glove compartment. I called Anderson and brought this to his attention and he told me it would be in the mail first thing Monday morning. I was hoping to get it by the end of the week. Tuesday morning the owners manual was delivered to my house followed by a call from Anderson on Wednesday just to make sure I received it. Anderson is a man of his word and a terrific guy to do business with."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Tried this place a few times and liked it enough to sign up for the monthly share card, $25 for 5 ultimate washes. Both me and the mr are super happy with the quality of the wash you get for for money. The customer service is also really good. We are always greeted with a smile and I really appreciate the free air fresheners, lollipops for the kids and dash wipes. I also appreciate today that the guys doing the pre scrub and power sprayer were happy to help scrub under my van's spoiler per my request. The dirt seems to build up under there. Me and the kids especially like Ashley because of her genuine warm smile and willingness to help.

Had to change my review in 2018: I still like this car wash but a couple things: They increased the cost of their share card by $5. I understand costs of doing business go up but an extra $60 per year is a like a swift kick in the jaw to a loyal member  who has referred many customers. 
 I had no problems with my silver van but the guys with the prep brushes got lots of scratches all over my new burgundy car. Now each time I go through, they write ""no brushes"" on my windshield but I wish they would have suggested that in the first place. 
I will still keep coming here but if the price goes up again I will look elsewhere for a new car wash."

Automotive,4.5,OR,"I have created a yelp profile just to leave this review. I had been having car issues for two months. My car had been to two mechanics in the area as well as a dealership and no one could diagnose the issues. Because I need reliable transportation I had to do some self diagnosing and ask my original mechanic to change some parts. He did and handed my keys to me. Got in my car and it was worse than ever. He just shrugged and said ""you asked me to change it."" Well I knew the problem might be that he used an aftermarket part or that I had a vacuum leak or both. He refused to consider any of that and told me to go back to the dealership. I instead took it to H and H. They were able to smoke test for leaks, instead of relying on the electronic code readers, and found I had leaks. Car still ran rough so they changed out the aftermarket for a Ford part and BINGO! Car fixed! Running smoother than ever and no stalling! I would have saved $300 had I taken it to H and H in the beginning. Don't mess around people, make your next service appointment with H and H. They are reliable, honest, communicative and most importantly they LISTEN to you. I could not be more pleased to have found them. So professional and so nice! I am considering adding them to my Holiday Card list! Amazing service and quality work!"

I was looking for a new car, but unfortunately they had it, so I went to this dealership. I am glad I did, because it was the only dealership that had a lot of cars I wanted. I was given the ""top of the line"" pricing for a few cars and I was able to find exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted. I wasn't pressured into buying any additional add-ons that I didn't need. I was also able to get a great price on my trade-in.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"Recently the car dealership quoted $100 for a new air filter and cabin air filter for our Outback Subaru, to which I said: ""HAHAHA BYEEEE.""

To be honest with you, changing the air filter in the car we use so seldom drive nowadays just was not high priority at the time. One of my fave hobbies is googling everything. And so a few searches and ultimately video clicks later I decided this was actually a project we could take on ourself. 

Today I called Advance Auto Parts, to inquire whether they had the filters, in advance. (Hehe I had to, sorry.) They didn't just let me know ""yes, yes we do"" or ""check the website"" as I was somewhat expecting but really hoping not to hear. What they said was  ""Yes, yes we do. And we will go get them for you, and put them up front and have it ready for you curbside when you arrive!"" To which I said ""YES VIRGINIA, THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS"" but in all seriousness I gladly took them up on this offer. 

Both filters together cost around $30. Take that, dealership! 

Though the filters didn't just install themselves, I'm fortunate enough to have some labor live with me. He is free  (and not too bad on the eyes) so the project cost a total of $33, a kiss, a few minutes of video research, and heck we will throw in a couple extra dollars to cover the mileage. Bringing us to a grand total of: WORTH IT."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I trusted this business with my jeep for 3 years. After some work recommended by them on my Jeep Wrangler at 55,000 miles, my check engine light came on 2 days later. Brought it by a different Jeep dealership that was nearby and it was attributed to the service provided by Larry H Miller. I trusted Larry H Miller, so I brought it back to them to have them look at it. First thing I was told was that it'll be $130 for the diagnostic fee, instead of ""let's see what the problem is and make sure it was not the work we did"". Sure enough, they said it was not related and quoted me $400 to fix the new problem. This doesn't instill confidence or trust in a business. I have lost all faith in this business. I paid the $130 diagnostics fee and will be having it checked over by another business.

Another thing they did that I found unreliable was that I was waiting in line to check in and a gentlemen who was wearing a Larry H Miller shirt came inside and asked for my keys. He didn't say why, I just figured he was grabbing the mileage for the associate. Nope, looked outside and I saw they had the alignment machine hooked up to my tires and started my jeep and rolled it forward. No asking, no permission, nothing, just did the check and handed me a piece of paper and said I needed an alignment. I felt so weird about it."

It was then that I noticed that the circuit that controls radio volume, phone and navigation was abnormally sticking out from the panel on my car. When I attempted to put in an address with the navigation system it didn't work, nor did my phone or radio.  I immediately called the West Norriton Auto Wash and asked for a manager.  I was placed on hold for at least 10 minutes.  When the manager answered the phone,  instead of saying hello he said ""yeah"", which was so unprofessional.  I told him I was on my way to his establishment.  When I arrived, he was rude and told me he had nothing to do with my navigation system and that his guys just wiped the area of the dashboard.  He refused to take any responsibility for the damage that fried my navigation.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"This dealership was impossible to deal with.  We spent a lot of time buying a car.  When we finally were ready to move forward the games began.  Constant bait and switch with trying to add to our bottom line price.  Three trips to the managers office and then us finally walking out got the deal done.  It was very painful.

Then shortly after buying the vehicle we took it in for service.  We were told front and back brakes needed to be done.  After paying over $900 for brakes we were on our way.  Now 7,000 miles into new brakes I took it to a different dealer since I had a thud sound coming from my brakes.  They told me the pads were installed without prepping the rotors (which is standard procedure).  My rotors are now scored and I am being quoted over $600 for front brakes and rotors.

I dread even calling Brandon back.  They lack accountability and look to cut every corner.  Steer clear when looking for your next car!

Update - worked with Nate and he was helpful.  He took the car in and found that the front brakes they replaced were indeed done incorrectly.  He agreed to replace them again at no charge.  In addition he provided a discount on some new tires and a bushing that needed replacement.  It was nice to get some concessions and acknowledgement of the issues.  Hopefully the brakes were done right this time!"

I was really impressed with the level of service and customer care I received. They even had a shuttle to pick me up from the airport. I will definitely be back. I had to take my car in for a routine oil change, which I was told was just a simple oil change, and a few other things that needed to be done. I was told it would take a while, and it was a bit longer than I thought I would. I dropped it off at 7:30am, and the next day I got a call saying my car was ready for pickup. I was very pleased with that! I will definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. I went in there on a Tuesday afternoon for an oil change.

I told him I had a AAA card and without telling me anything about what he was charging me for he handed me an invoice with Supplemental Liability Insurance at $15.75 a day on it.  I told him I didn't want the extra insurance because I NEVER pay for the Supplemental Insurance because my policy covers vehicle rentals. He gave me some BS about AAA having a bonus deal and in order to get that I had to take the extra insurance.  It was obvious I had been crying and was setup.  I just didn't have it in me to stand there and argue with him, so I signed the invoice and went on my way knowing I just got screwed. 
Just got off the phone with Avis Customer Service, more BS and after being charged over $95 for the extra insurance she offered me $25. AVIS, keep the money because you'll never get another dime off of me and I will bad  mouth your company any chance I get.  
To add  ""Insult to Injury""  the agent at the counter gave me incomplete directions to get to Greenfield and added an additional hour to my driving time.

First service didn't even answer the phone. I drove to the dealer anyway. The service advisor acted as though he was doing me a favor by selling me tires. I asked if the tires on the car were under any sort of warranty since we bought the car new and it had only 21,000 miles. He pretty much laughed at me. Then he said he only had the same tires that were currently on the car. When I said I'd rather wait for better tires in Carson he suddenly had better tires.

A rental car would cost $45 and we only had 3 hours so I signed up to ride the shuttle to the mall which was south. The northbound shuttle driver told us we needed to wait for the southbound driver. Over an hour later, the northbound driver came back and gave us a ride, at which time he also told us that shuttle service ended at 6 although the service department closes at 7 and our car wouldn't be ready until then.

When I lost him to cancer 7 years ago I thought I would never find a shop or guys that would care again when working on my car or dealing with a tight budget. Well today that all changed for me. Evan in the office did a nice job but the person that impressed me the most was Jon the mechanic that took the time to show me things on the car and explain what was going on and let me know what needed to be done now and what could wait just a little while longer until my finances were not so tight. He worked with the sales guy to get me quality products to resolve my issues at a fair price and did all he could to shave off the cost including labor time. I know Pep Boys is a chain, but these guys treated me as if it was their own shop and really cared about the situation and doing what was right for me. I cannot thank Jon and Evan enough.

I was yelled at for not understanding the situation by Jamie..because the salesman Ryan Spearman messed up. I was treated poorly and disrespected for their own employees fault. 

Needless to say. I put 100 cash down for them to hold..then had to pick up a paper check. I was asked for my receipt which I wasn't even given a receipt when i put the money down to hold the vehicle I was promised.

This car dealership is bogus!! They were approved by a loan company but instead they wanted to back out of an agreement they had already agreed to. 
Worst experience at a car dealership."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Did not enjoy my two experiences here at all and would not recommend to anyone.  Both times, I came in optimistic to test out a XC60.  Granted, I am at the beginning of my car search - but still knew what type of car and what model of Volvo I wanted to get a feel for.  

The first time, after sitting for about half an hour discussing options, the salesman brought us out to the parking lot only to tell me that we would not be able to test out the car because they had closed (even though he brought us out to drive it).  We went over to Jeep and the salesman stayed 45 minutes after closing just to let us test drive.

The next time I went to Volvo, my boyfriend and I told the salesman about our previous experience, gave ourselves an hour, and talked about test driving the car.  It felt as if the salesman wanted to convince us NOT to get a Volvo, despite our efforts to at least sit in and potentially test drive the car.  We talked to him about how he did not take us seriously probably 6 times during our conversation, and ended up leaving frustrated because we were not able to even sit in or see the interior of a car we were interested in.

I still like Volvos but I would NEVER recommend this dealership, and honestly think that they missed out on a sale opportunity simply because they did not take us seriously."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"This dealership has been the best I have found in central Florida. I have been to five different dealerships. Two in Orlando, one in Tampa, one in largo one in Melbourne. Some have all these gimmicks, like a 90inch tv at the waiting room, free food. And shit like that. To cover the bad service and the ""sell, sell"" attitude. To include the one I bought my car at. I can care less about those gimmicks, you are taking your car home not that TV.. 

Service is great. My service guy there is Keith. Great guy, honest, knowledgeable and very helpful. 
Of course just like in any bussiness, profit is made by selling. But I did noticed. Here they don't try to sell you shit you don't need.  For those of you that might not be familiar with maintenance. There is such a thing as ""preventive"" maintenance. An example of that is break fluid. PEOPLE!!!! Brake fluid needs to be replaced in whatever vehicle you have. The constant friction creates height temperatures, burns it out and thins it out. Affecting performance. If a battery is 2-3 years old, needs to be replaced even if it still working fine. (Just like cellphone batteries charge cycles get  diminish with time) So you don't get that surprise when it leaves you stranded. So when a dealership brings that to your attention it's a valid shit. Not trying to sell you shit you don't need.  

Anyway. I do recommend this dealership even over the one I got my car in."

Automotive,4.5,OR,"I'm siding with the majority here.  I feel like I could have walked in and said ""something's wrong, here's a blank check, fix it,"" and everything would have been alright.

After a brutal day of work finally released it's kung fu grip on my life sometime around midnight, I was looking forward to sleeping in for the first time in a long time.  Instead, I was awakened at 6:00am by my sobbing, though still lovely girlfriend who had had a nightmare about me dying when my car exploded due to an old oil filter.  Knowing that 11th St opened in half an hour, I took the hint and went for an oil change.

Beyond the oil change, I knew something else was wrong.  When breaking, the whole car shakes.  Maybe that's my car's way of showing affection, maybe it's the breaks.  Who knows?  I asked the guys to take a look at it.

I wasn't able to get to the shop by 5, so they just said to pick it up in the morning, so I did.  I asked about the shaking, and they said it was the rotors, but the pads were still good, so rather than replacing the breaks (which would have cost a bit more) they simply made some adjustments to the rotors.

Ultimately, they had a chance to make a lot of money off of me, and they preferred to keep it simple and safe.  Plus, they're really nice guys.

For that, thank you 11th st.  You're my new car guys."
Automotive,3.5,CG,"When we drove into the dealership, the car we wanted was in a hurry, and the salesman we worked with was very pushy, and took us to a ""good"" deal. We had to take it to another dealership in the area for them to complete the paperwork. The manager also tried to convince us that the car was in a major accident and that it was unsafe to drive. I was shocked, but I am sure it is. I feel very comfortable with the dealership, and would highly recommend the dealership. I've been taking my cars to John Kennedy since 2005 and have always been pleased with the service and customer service at John Kennedy. It's a family owned business that provides fair and honest service. It's hard to find a good mechanic, but John Kennedy has it!  I have never been disappointed with their work. I'd recommend them to everyone. I recommend them to everyone I know. I purchased a used 2012 Subaru Forester from them and was very happy with the experience. However, the service department was terrible. The service department does not seem to be very accommodating and the work is not very sloppy and I was told by the service advisor that I had a loaner vehicle would be on the loaner car would be taken out."

I ended up buying a car somewhere else and I ended up having to go to a different dealer to have it looked at. The manager told me that he would not be able to look at it for a few hours because he couldn't get it to look at it. When I went to get my car, I was told that it was not my car. I asked if I could get it fixed by a local dealer and he said no. The service manager told me that he was unable to find the part and that I should call the dealership to see if it was available. I asked if I could drop the car off and get a loaner car. I was told that they didn't have time to look at it. I made an appointment for the next day.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"Alrighty, where do I even begin with this. My car battery was stolen from my driveway so I used the roadside assistance provided by my insurance, Elephant Auto, and they paired me with South Side Towing. I needed to get it towed to the dealership which was conveniently in the radius I'm covered by. I was prepared to wait a couple hours per usual with towing companies. The receipt says ""driver: AT"" but I could have sworn he said his name was Josh on the phone, can't remember. Everything was fine, he called to let me know he was 15 minutes away, and when he called to get exact directions into my neighborhood it was like a fuse was starting to go off. He was so bratty and made me feel horrible about not knowing ""exactly"" what was wrong with my car. I do have to give him credit because I hadn't checked my hood before he got there, so he was the one who determined the battery was stolen. Last time my car didn't start the battery was there & all the resources in the world say not to jump start Nissan Sentras with push starts. Anyway, he came speeding up blasting fall out boy (the worst album btw) & was an a**hole the whole time. He got my car to the dealership and parked it as FAR as possible by the dumpsters. I'm writing this review from the dealership- the staff is STILL trying to locate my car. A big EFF YOU to the beanbag who towed my car."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Poor Business Practices - No Accountability! I have gone to other locations in the past and have had great experiences. This location was vastly different unfortunately. Upon pulling into the lot to get my brakes inspected, I quickly realized just how small and crowded of a parking lot they have in front of the shop. It was enough that I commented to my girlfriend that I'm surprised they don't have a bunch of fender benders trying to move cars around. After the inspection was complete, I picked up my car and drove immediately home. The following day when walking to my car I noticed a pretty significant scratch on my rear bumper. This could've only happened at the shop since my car was parked in my private garage. When I called the manager he denied everything and said that his employees would report something like that. I like to have faith in humanity, but I'm not naïve, not everyone is going to come clean to their boss about an accident, especially if their job is on the line. Since the shop also doesn't have cameras, it became a ""my word vs his"" with no resolve. It's unfortunate that there was 0 accountability and that the owner was not willing to do anything to make right of the situation. This has completely soured me on going back to any Calvert's and I will be sure to inform anyone I know that needs mechanical work of my experience. With this type of business practice, they do not deserve my business or anyone else's."

Yet they still had the car on the lot. And they're an all credit approved place the guy wanted to act like he couldn't approve me and put fear in me to pick. I also mentioned how a lot of the pricing for the other cars I was looking at were priced too high I've already looked on these brands & ages they tried to make excuses on it. 
At this point I was coming to understand the unprofessional behavior as well as the shadiness, yet I still found somewhat interest in this white Audi and there was no sales people around to come with me on the test drive they wanted me to wait for 30mins, I said no then one of the men in there offered pulled it up and I then noticed a deep scrape below the door and it's a white car so it popped more then the guy said I'm not test driving it with an attitude and told a guy from service to park it back up and gave me my paystubs back.

He let us arrive a week early due to my husbands job & waves every time he passes by & has even stopped to check in to make sure we had everything we needed. The activities for the kids are pretty awesome, large bouncy houses, hay rides, scheduled activities, live music on the weekends, breakfast buffet on the weekend mornings, etc. you can tell they put a lot of work into it. During the week it's quiet & calm, although it's not summer season. Giving a 4 star, only because we've only been here a week or so (so I'll check back & change my review as needed) and the pond area could be cleaned up a bit & more dumpsters added so the trash doesn't overflow when it gets busy on the weekends. Some of the campers look ill cared for and like they are from the beginning of time- good and bad. People have stayed so long because they love it here they've acquired more things at their site, but some could use a few rules/cleanup. But it is a campground after all, so not too picky.

I understand now where those additional damages & fees comes from, from the other reviews I read a while back. I immediately phoned the manager to advise him not let her step foot in my car. Fast forward I was told the repairs wud take an estimated time of 2days for repairs so I rented a rental car for 3days just in case. Well 2 days later I called in because no one had followed up with me regarding my vehicle repairs. I was then advised that they would need a week to repair my car due to unexpected additional repairs which judging from my quote was damaged doing the time of repair in which I was responsible for..

Well, the $100 dollar come on was in reality 4 $25. 00 gift certificates to different restaurants, to be used with a $50. 00 minimum. I learned this when the technician replaced the glass and handed me one GC and said he was out but would drop off the other three!!!  Then I looked at my invoice and at the bottom it said $100 gift card. Several times when the sales rep was ""selling"" me on the replacement, he mentioned $100 DOLLARS. Never did he mention Gift Cards. So, I called him and shared my dismay at basically being lied to and he was so sorry. They would get the other three cards to me and send me something else in the mail more appropriate for me than dining certificates. I live alone and dine out at high end restaurants rarely and wouldn't spend $50 dollars if I did!!!  It's been almost a month. I got nuthin'.

I called a few other places for help and they were all closed.  I called around and they were able to get me in right away and get me in right away.  They didn't try to sell me anything, and they were very polite and honest.  I will definitely be back.  Thanks guys!I've had a few bad experiences here. I have used this car wash a couple of times. The first time I had a bad experience with the car wash. I thought it was good, but the second time I went through the car wash the guy who ran my car through the car wash didn't even touched it.

I showed up at 4:35PM and was told it would be another hour. At 4:45PM I was told that the vehicle was in the shop. I told them I had to wait on the shuttle to get there. I was told that they were finishing up and that they were waiting for me to come back. At 4:05PM I was told they had not seen the vehicle yet. I was told that the vehicle was still there. At this point I was appalled at the lack of communication. I had to ask the manager and the manager, who I believe is the manager, if they were going to take care of the vehicle. I explained that I was having trouble getting my vehicle back in the shop and wanted to get my money back. At this point I was extremely upset, frustrated and upset. 

I spoke with the manager, who was very apologetic and apologized for the inconvenience and said he would have me personally check the car out the tires and make sure that the tires. I had on my vehicle. He said they were fine. I was going to get a few days later and told me that the tires"
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I am very surprised to see recent negative reviews; I have been going to MB of Tampa since 2009 and have not had a single bad experience; in fact, every experience has been pleasant, professional, and efficient.   We brought our CLK in for service for about 5 years and then decided to purchase an E Coupe.   We were very particular regarding the exterior color and interior furnishings and options, and as this was going to be a Certified Pre-Owned, it can be a challenge.  Vito not only found the perfect car for us, but he also went above and beyond by picking us up from a car rental place, ferrying us to another car rental place (long story...), and finally whisked us through the paperwork so we could make it to a dinner reservation: now, that's exceptional service.

Concerning service, there is none better in the business, from my experience.  Our service manager, Dustin, is the quintessential professional.  He has been very responsive to any and all inquiries and has fit us in with short notice for an emergency.  I have personally seen and heard the other consultants work with customers over the past 7 years, and not once have I seen anything less that 100% professional.

As for loaner cars, MB of Tampa has taken care of us each and every time we've had to leave our car overnight.  For shorter appointments, they've either provided a loaner, if available, or arranged for transportation to/from work (but that has only been necessary once - as loaners are typically available)."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Totally unsatisfactory service.
My wife and I stopped by this car wash on our way back from Burning Man and paid $120 for their Super Wash in hopes of returning our U-Haul in excellent condition in an effort to avoid any fines or cleaning charges. 
After 3 hours waiting for our van to be cleaned, we went to check on the progress of the work and he van was still a total mess! Piles of dust under the passenger seat. dust in the corners of the doors and windows - the bare minimum effort on the part of the cleaner and total disinterest on the part of the manager. Worst of all, in 3 hours of ""super cleaning"" this van, the guy never even bothered to lift the rubber mat in the back. After telling us the car was finished, we lifted the mat and found leaves, dirt and all sorts of crap that was definitely there before we even got the van, but it still should have been cleaned after 3 hours and $120.
In the end, my wife and I ended up cleaning out the remaining mess ourselves. We complained to the management who couldn't have cared less and mocked us with his team when he thought we weren't looking. We were promised a call from the regional manager Dan, that still hasn't come 10 days later.
Avoid this lazy, dishonest business under any circumstances, but especially after Burning Man. They will take your money and send you on your way with a car that no rental company would accept back without charging you additional cleaning penalties."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This dealership is deceptive! BEWARE. A couple of things to note, I have had over 30 vehicles in my life, most purchased from dealers and nothing like this has ever happened to me. Also, the sales-person was fantastic and I know this was not her fault. 

My fiance and I are looking for a new vehicle to tow a few things and she decided to look at a 2019 Durango that was listed online for a little over $33,000. She went by herself since I was working and drove 45 minutes to get there. She test drives it, loves the car, and sits down to discuss numbers. They offer a decent amount for her trade, but the purchase price of the vehicle skyrockets to $37,995 + $995 for ""accessories."" She asks why the price has gone up over $5,000? They told her the listed price was for those who are ""paying in cash"" and this is listed in their terms of service (which were laminated, so you know we are not the first one to be hoodwinked.) Obviously this is extremely deceptive advertising and her trip was a waste of time and money. 

I also feel they were deceptive and tried to raise the prices because of her gender, age, and the fact that she was alone. It is SHAMEFUL the car industry continues to try and scam people based on gender and age especially during this time of social reckoning! Cherry Hill will never earn our business and if you decide to go there, be-careful of deceptive pricing and hidden fees. 

Management should be fired!"

The second time, the battery was dead and the battery was not working. They wanted to charge me $250. 00 for the battery and charge me $20. 00 for labor. They wanted $50. 00 for labor and $25. 00 for labor. I declined and told them I would take it to another shop. They said I had an hour and a half to put the battery in. I told them I would be back next day. I was there for about an hour and half, and they said I could bring it back in the next day. They said they could give me a loaner vehicle for the day, but I declined.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"Terrible experience, would like to give zero stars. Felt like we got a ""bait and switch."" We travel extensively  and make it it to Santa Barbara at least four times a year and always get a rental. We went thru Budget at Santa Barbara Airport as they had good prices. We told the female agent that we have excellent insurance and did not want any of the many upsells she attempted. Then we had to go thru the usual tedious process of declining everything. We didn't notice that she snuck in a ""collision damage"" waiver and now we're stuck with $132 in additional fees. We spoke to Paul, who was pleasant and apologized, but he said the manager said there was nothing to be done as if we had gotten into an accident they would be legally bound to cover it. We spoke to the manager and she told us the same thing. She made it sound like our ""con"" was to ask for the waiver so that at the end of the trip we could call and deny we requested it and get our money back. Ridiculous. We are quite well off and can afford anything. What we take exception to is being charged for something we specifically told the agent we didn't want. The manager finally agreed to give us a 50% credit like she was doing us a great favor. We own a business. If we treated our customers like we were treated by Budget, we would be out of business. We are writing on every website to describe our very unfortunate experience."

I thought I would not be able to find another honest mechanic, yet when I was referred to Monsoon Auto, it was much like the mechanic I had in California.  This Auto Repair Shop in my experience has been very HONEST with me.  I am on a fixed income and they not only perform my auto repairs at a good price, but they also are honest and tell me when something can wait a few months.  That to me is what I look for in an honest mechanic.  I also have taken 2 used cars that I wanted to check out prior to buying them to Monsoon and they were honest and told me one had about $4,000 in repairs I would have to do if I bought it - thank you so much for that, it saved me all that money - and the other, they told me was in good condition.  Of course I purchased the latter.  I was involved in a hit and run and thus am looking for a new -used- car and have asked them to keep an eye out for one that a customer may be selling that they feel would be inexpensive not only to buy but for repairs should they arise.  I HIGHLY recommend Monsoon Auto.  They are an HONEST auto repair shop which is very hard to find these days."

I brought my car in for a simple tire rotation.  The guy behind the counter said the tires were fine, and it was ready to go when I arrived.  

I then brought my car back in for the second time to get my car checked out.  They told me it would take about 30 minutes.  I went to pick up my car and the guy behind the counter told me it would be about an hour or more.  I told him I was there for 2 hours, and I was told it would take about an hour or so.

He said I had to wait another 30 minutes.  I asked him why I was waiting for my car to be looked at and he said that he didn't have time to wait.

I was assigned to a man named El Shan who asked me to wait because he had another customer. My wait turned into and hour and I still had not been able to do anything but look at the car on the lot. I was told by another employee Robbie that I could do a rent to buy and keep the car for 3 days. He said since I was picking it up on Friday and they were closed on Sunday that Sunday wouldn't count. However when I took the car back on Monday Dominic checked me in. My receipt showed that I would be charged $169.60 and I asked him if that what I would be charged He said yes. But when I checked my credit card they billed me $229.39. He said I kept the car an extra day and when I told him what Robbie said, he said I wasn't aware of that. How could I return the car when they were closed I asked? He said well you need to talk to Robbie but he probably can't help you. These people are con artist to the max. When I went in I had this feeling that they were not honest. You should trust your instincts. I know I will never, never use Hertz again. If I could give them 0 stars I would.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"My own review seems consistent with a theme I am seeing from others.

For years, CJ's was the place I would take all 4 of my vehicles.  Good service, decent prices, not trying to sell me unnecessary work.  Unfortunately, things seem to have slipped in the last couple of years.

Picked up a set of new tires.  Had to go back as all were missing valve stem covers.

Dropped my car  off for inspection.  Got a call back that it needs a few things.  The drivers side mirror wiggles a bit and needs to be replaced, The one wiper is an inch longer than OEM spec.  I recall that they wanted about $400 to fix this.  I picked up a brand new mirror assembly from RockAuto (although I question if it really needed replacing) for $35 dollars and replaced it myself in 15 minutes.  For 9 years I have run a longer wiper as the original leaves a huge gap top and bottom.  It was never a problem at inspection time.  I looked up the PA inspection regs, they specify no rips, functionality, etc. but nothing about size of the blade. 

I appreciate when things that really need replacing, are a safety risk, or are broken that they identify them.  Equally, I appreciate that repairs will be made at a fair price.  More recently it feels like they are looking for things to fix and overcharge for.

I have two vehicles due for inspection this month.  I will likely be trying out a new shop this time around."

Like I said, I went in for an oil change and they came back and told me I had sludge completely backed up and my engine was in danger. They told me I was in desperate need of an engine flush which was like 100 bucks and an oil change on top of that.They tried to convince me to get this service done that day but it sounded so fishy I said ""no thanks"". So they ""advised"" me that after I received an oil change that day that I would need to get back there in like 500 miles for the engine flush and ANOTHER oil change on top of this. I said ""yea okay"" and went home. That following Monday I went to work and scheduled an appt to get my car looked at (3 weeks out). The company I work for hires a company to come in to do oil changes amongst other car services every 3rd Friday of the month.

After taking my car to several other shops, (le schwab, big o tires, mechanics, etc.) they all said there was nothing wrong and that my car's noise was normal.  I started to give up until I explained my problem to a fellow coworker, aka mechanic, and he recommended me to Reno Vulcanizing.  
       When I took my car to RV,  I told them my situation, and they suspected several things and found out my car needed an alignment, and they did my alignment for free that day.  I was advised by Roberto to get certain parts, and then come back, and they would do the work.  When I got my car back, I was very impressed!  THEY FIXED IT!  
       I recommend these guys to everyone.  They're very friendly, professional, and knowledgable which are key factors to being a successful company.

Snyder's was the answer to my worries. I have a 1998 Suburban and was debating whether to repair the transmission or junk the truck. It sat in my driveway for 2 months while I considered if a $400 evaluation (my thought of what it would take) was worth it when I might just be throwing it away. Snyder's to the rescue. I called them, described the symptoms on the phone, and was told what was wrong and how much money and time it would take to fix it. I was also told how to drive the vehicle to the shop if I decided to repair it. We also discussed the pros and cons of replacing the transmission versus repairing it. I had complete confidence in what I was hearing, and complimented them on their professionalism and straight-forward approach. They said they don't stay in business as long as they have by making customers mad. Wow! I wish they did everything I needed with my home and vehicles. They would be my go-to people.
I never even met them. I dropped the vehicle and keys off at night and paid by credit card a few days later and picked up my truck. It has run perfectly fine ever since.

The place looks as you might expect a garage that specializes in motorcycles to look -- Biker-looking guys working with wrenches, motorcycles up on lifts and pin-up girl posters on the walls. 

When I was in there yesterday, another guy brought in his motorcycle for sale, and the exchange that they had made me want to write this review.  He offered to store the bike, post an ad on craigslist and basically be the frontman for the sale of it, all for a 10% commission.  Considering that he got 2 phonecalls from people looking to buy used motorcycles just while I was there is definitely a good sign.  Good information to have when the time comes.

My bike needed a new battery last year, and my buddy had an extra battery from his 800cc bike that was just lying around, so I brought it in to Riverside, not knowing if it would fit into my bike.  John said that it wouldn't, but he gave me a store credit for the list price of the battery, which I thought was very generous.

I got quotes from all the major dealers, and Conicelli ended up giving me the best one. I called them to confirm that the vehicle was indeed available, and that I could come buy it, and drive off the lot, in as little time as possible. The salesman, Frank, confirmed this was possible, and made me an appointment.

I took a $100 Uber ride out there, and when I got there, it was a comedy of errors. First, they brought out the completely wrong car. Then, when I gave them the VIN that was provided to me, they said that the car didn't actually exist. Then they said, if I wanted to drive off the lot that day, there were only two vehicles In the wrong color, both of which were more expensive For reasons they could not explain to me.  The sales person just kept blaming the original sales person, as if they did not both work for the exact same company.  This whole experience took over three hours.

So at the end of the day, they bait and switched me, wasted $200 of Uber rides which they refused to reimburse, I had no car, lost five hours of time, and I had to restart the search. I am filing a complaint with the BBB. If you are looking for a vehicle, stay the heck away from this place."

Automotive,2.5,CG,"Very Unprofessional- Bad Business! First time here and the owner is a piece of crap. I went there to get an oil change and the guy said they're open till 6. They close at 6. They told me it'd be a couple of hours. I was told it would take about an hour. 2 hours later I was told it would take about an hour to complete the oil change. I was shocked. When I asked why it took so long I was told that I had to wait for 30 minutes to be told the price. I've never been so mad with a car dealership before and I understand that but I felt that they didn't try to up sell me on anything I didn't need. I'm sure I'll never go back here again.I've been going to this location for years and have never been disappointed. I have been going to this location for all of my car needs. They have always taken the time to explain the issues and the pricing. I always feel like they are fair and honest.

I recently had some minor issues with my car that I needed to have been told would need attention to, and the service manager Joe and I was able to call me back to discuss the issue. He was able to discuss issues. He did not only what I had asked me to discuss the issue and get back"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Over the years of owning my RX 400h I have had the pleasure of having my car serviced by the this dealership and overall the experience has been great.  I really took time in deciding to post this recent experience but I thought robbery not to share it.  I took my car in for inspection of the front axles since it was flagged at my state inspection at another repair shop and the Lexus repairman found that there were no issues at all. The car passed inspection no issues however.  In fact the customer service person told me there we no leaks under my vehicle and it was the driest he'd seen.  I was not charged for this check.  I picked up my car and went home.  

The very next morning when I was leaving I started my car as it was a typical cold morning then went outside to find red liquid pouring out of my car.  The liquid ran all the way out and down my driveway. 

I called the cust. service person and arranged to bring my car in immediately.  Within 10 minutes I was told that the radiator had cracked and was the cause of the leak, cost was $938 to repair!!!  It's seemed less than believable that the crack would appear after being serviced by them the previous day.

My advice with this service department is to get a second opinion.  I only have one vehicle and it is really not advisable to drive it in the condition that my car was left in.  Proceed with caution."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"Don't go here! They don't want car sales! My husband and I went to buy a car from this dealer. They guy said that the vehicle was priced at the lower KBB, it was not, I looked it up. He also said that the vehicle was purchased at an auction and they needed to get it off the lot soon cause it was already on the lot for a few months. We liked the car so we took it to our mechanic, which they were really apprehensive about and had to get special approval to do so. He tried to encourage us to follow their polices first and buy the car and then take it to our mechanic. So we insisted about our mechanic looking at it. Our mechanic said that the car was pretty good but it needed new tires prior to a trip we are going on in the next week with our young children and said it would be a safety concern otherwise. Well when we talked to the dealer and explained they were rude and defensive and they wanted their listed price only, they would not budge with anything at all. It didn't even have both key sets. I even asked the guy for something like free oil changes or anything. These people are greedy and the type of car sales that gives the entire industry a bad reputation. When my husband told them about what our mechanic said about the tires they said they didn't care because their guys checked it off the list. So they really don't care about safety or customer service."

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Let me just start, I bought a bimini combo kit with the emergency top in June 2014.  After waiting many weeks, it finally came sometime in August.  I did not want to put it on since hurricane season was coming. Just a few days ago I put the new soft top on and it rained.  Well let me just say that there were two swimming pools on top of my jeep, the whole top caved in.  So I started a chat with an online support tech and he said that there is an additional part that I could get to stop the pooling on top of the jeep, but there would still be water running down the sides into my jeep.  When I spoke to a representative, he said that there was nothing he could do about this.  This was a COMMON problem with this type of top.   If this a common problem, then why don't you mention that there is no complete seal OR better yet, fix this issue so there is a complete seal because obviously I am not the only one with this problem. 

They would not let me exchange it for even a little credit towards a new top (though I probably wouldn't get it until september because their shipping sucks).  So they definitely lost me as a customer.  I will not be ordering ever again, nor will I be recommending them to anybody.

To top it off, I had to use the emergency top and there was a huge slit on the side.  Poor quality and poor customer service."

They also had the car ready for me when I arrived to pick it up. They even called me after a few days to tell me it was ready.

I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a great auto repair shop.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"So I have been putting off this review because I helped my gf buy a used car from Acura of Limerick back in December 2013. I just wanted to see how it would fare before leaving a review.

My gf and I live in North Jersey. We saw the car online on one of those popular car search sites. We called the number according to Acura of Limerick's website and spoke with John (who we later found out was relatively new at Acura of Limerick). I asked whether they could do better on the price (even though the price was already pretty competitive), and he gave me an even better price. I told John we would be down the next morning.

*After doing so much research and reading stories about how car buyers would drive hours to a dealership only to find out they became victims of the ""bait and switch""... where the buyer would call to confirm a car's availability, travel, and then find out that the car ""was just sold a few hours ago""... I called the dealership just before closing time (car still available), and drove the next morning before the dealership opened. Guess what? The car was still there! No Bait and Switch.

We test drove the car, had it inspected by a nearby mechanic, negotiated a bit more, signed the paperwork, and we were on our way.

Even though it was the holiday season, my gf got her license plates and other documents before the 30-day temporary plate expired. I think I called once while waiting for the plates, but no other follow up was needed.

Thanks John! We are very happy with the car!"

There was 0ne customer ahead of me and they was selling everything they could to this sucker. They could of come out and said would you mind moving over to the other lanes and we will get you in as soon as we can but they didn't i got out of my car to stretch my legs and stood there before someone came out and asked me what i needed and i asked how much longer and they said it would be another hour to hour and half or so and they went back in after i gave them an ear full of what i thought about this place. And the guy behind me asked how much longer and i told him and he said screw this place and left and when he left i left? That is no way to run your business. I was there early in the morning around 9:00 or later i was back home by 11:30 because i got tired of waiting. I had a $10.00 dollar coupon but it isn't worth the hassle with that place i will drive 20 miles out of my way before i go back to that piss poor place hole of business and the way it is ran.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"My son dropped my car off at Suntrup Ford Westport a couple of months ago because I am disabled and frankly I didn't want to risk getting covid. Jeff said that he would let us know when my car was ready but after not hearing anything by the end of the week my son went to the dealership to see when the car would be done, only to find out that our car was finished a week ago. When I called to speak to Jeff, he wouldn't come to the phone or return my call. I called back the next day and talked to Gary who promised to come to a resolution and call me back. My insurance covered four days of rental so because we didn't know our car was done a week before, I  lost my $200 deposit. When Gary didn't return my call I called back and spoke to the service manager who was totally fine with the way his employees has treated a paying customer, and he actually suggested that my son's voice-mail wasn't working correctly. When I told him that I am disabled and don't have $200 to drive around in a rental car when I have a car, he said that I would be surprised at how many people leave their cars on the lot and that they are not obligated to call a customer more than once. Very condescending and unprofessional. No one mentioned the employees avoiding my calls and no one apologized for the rude behavior. Suntrup Ford Westport does not have service integrity, no matter what they say and I will never patronize their dealership again."

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Wow! I am left stunned at how amazing this dealership is. 

We recently bought a Buick Enclave through a private sale, and brought it to Century Buick GMC to get inspected and get work done on it. It needed quite a bit of work, so we ended up getting a loaner car. 

Upon getting it back, my husband and I heard some sounds that we hadn't heard before. Wasn't too concerning, but we just wanted to get it checked out by them to make sure it wasn't anything bad. 

We were put in contact with Guy Denig. From the start, he was very receptive of our complaint and seemed truly concerned. He really wanted to see the car and took a lot of time to explain what it could possibly be. He was very empathetic, and I was very surprised by that... considering we called with a complaint. When I told him how hard it would be for me to go (I have twin babies), he offered many other possible options to have my car seen. I was very shocked at how important this matter was to him. 

I ended up going with my twins, and the experience was great. While my car was being checked out, Guy gave me a tour of the dealership. This place literally has everything you can possibly think of. Coffee, a movie theatre-- a literal hair salon! I was stunned. Everyone there was so pleasant and happy. I felt so comfortable! 

Nothing ended up being wrong with my Buick, but I am looking forward to coming back for future services (and possibly blow-dry! ) I highly recommend this dealership to everyone!"

I dropped the car off at 7:30 that morning.  At 5:00 that evening I called them for an update because no one had called me. When I called, I was told by Scott, my service advisor, that no one had even looked at the car and that they will probably get to it tomorrow. I asked about a loaner car and I was told that they are out of loaners.  So, on today, I called again and was told that they won't be able to look at it until tomorrow just to tell me what's wrong with it. Again, I asked about a loaner and was told that I should have made an appointment with the loner department and that they won't have any loaner vehicles until next week. So what am I supposed to do until then? I was told that I could come and get the car and bring it back when a loaner is available. My car is having transmission problems (while still under warranty). Who would advise that I still drive it? This is a great inconvenience for me because  I am a real estate agent and this affects my business. The service advisors an nonchalant and uncaring. I am very disappointed in the service at Cadillac of New Orleans. I feel that my business is not appreciated at Cadillac of New Orleans and they will no longer get it.

I have never had such a pleasant experience at a car dealership. This was my first time there and I am so happy that I made the decision to buy a car from them. The sales team was very nice and helpful. I was able to buy a vehicle online and get a good price on the vehicle. I also found that the finance manager was very nice and helpful and was very helpful. I went in to look at a car I had seen on Car Gurus website and the salesman was great! I felt like a valued customer. I was very happy with my purchase and was very happy with my purchase.

He responded exactly the same way when I asked how long it would take.  I thought that was absurd that he wouldn't tell me anything, but I took it there anyway.  When I arrived, I mentioned the mailer coupon, and he said, matter-of-factly, ""Not this car, this takes synthetic"".  When I then asked how much it would cost, he -silently- pointed me inside.  I walked in, looking for the counter that any respectable business would have, figuring I needed to get a quote, and after I was about 20ft inside the building, he yelled, ""Yo boss, where you going? I'm right here"", and pointed to a sign on wall.  I said, ""Okay, so this is the price?"", to which he responded, ""No, this is for 5 quarts, yours takes 7 or 8"", and just looked at me.  I finally had to say, ""Dude, can you quote me a price please?""  Afterwards, I just walked out, the guy was just vague and annoying enough for me to not trust him, and no way I was putting a BMW in his hands.  I can't imagine how people who act like that stay in business, and something tells me he won't be for long.  The place was dead on a holiday when most other places are booming.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"This  dealership is awful.  They just take advantage of people.  We purchased a car there and had agreed upon terms.  They brought us back in to resign our paperwork stating they got us a better interest rate, which they did.  However, the payments remained the same and they jacked up the price of the car $8,000.  They danced around that part of the new deal until we had signed and saw what they had done.  The Service department is awful, the sales people promise the world then when they cannot deliver, they go dark and the finance department is the worst of them all.  We came in after selling our Kia to get our extended warranty refunded.  They said they sent in the paperwork and to expect our check in 4-6 weeks.  After 6 weeks we did not have a check so we went back into the dealership.  Nathan in finance told us that the previous finance manager did not send it in and that he would.  He said to expect the check within 4-6 weeks- again after 6 weeks, nothing.  We ended up contacting JM and A directly for our refund.  We learned that this is a trick that finance departments do so they are not charged back for products that people buy.  This is to help their pockets and sales quotas and in my eye is totally unethical.  

This dealership is the worst of what everyone thinks about car dealers. Stay away- you will be taken care of better at another dealership and not be taken advantage of at every department."

Automotive,3.5,OR,"DO NOT use this company. I really hate to write a bad review and am not one to bash a company but we are so displeased with Abbey Glass and their service that it needs to be known. We read a review on yp.com (yellow pages) stating issues with air leaks and then repeated no-shows to scheduled appointments but decided to give Abbey Glass a chance anyway. Terrible idea. They were very cooperative and quick to schedule our windshield replacement, also very quick to cash our check. Great service initially until they got our money. Immediately noticed an air leak upon first driving the vehicle. Scheduled to come back out - they no showed for the first appointment (no courtesy call from Mark who I assume is management or owner to let us know he forgot to tell the guys to come out) but we let that go and reschedule. Next appointment, no show that morning. After difficult communication and back and forths, they finally show up and insist there is no air leak (although there definitely still is) and then they leave us with a broken windshield wiper. Schedule a call for them to come fix that, Mark insists he will call us before the guy shows, and they never showed up, never called, and don't answer when we call. Thankfully after digging into it, my husband was able to fix the wiper, but what if he couldn't? Total safety issue in my opinion. They left us with a faulty windshield that definitely still presents with an air leak AND a broken windshield wiper. Prices were good, but I would have paid more to not have so many issues."

I was told that I could not do it for a certain price, and that I would have to wait a week for the car. I did not want to waste my time and was given the ""top off"" of the list price. I had an appointment for 3 weeks out, and when I got there I was told that the car was still available. I asked why the price was so high, and the salesman said that the price was based on the internet price of the car. When I asked if they could give me a price, he said that the online price was more than the advertised price, and that the price was the internet price for the car. I was not a bit high.

I would recommend to anyone looking for a new car, definitely ask for Chris!I have never had such a pleasant experience at a car dealership. I was greeted by my salesman, Mark. He was very patient and thorough with me and my wife and I. He was very friendly and respectful to our needs and would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a vehicle. I would recommend them to check them out!Went in to purchase a used a vehicle. When we were told them that they did not have the vehicle. No credit check in hand wash and leave a deposit and then they told us to check out the vehicle."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Sunshine Service Brake & Alignment is a good place and trust worthy.

I have been taking my vehicles here for over 7 years now and they have never failed me. I have an RV that get work done here and also a few other vehicles but I have never had an issue with them not getting the job done. Also the main thing I like about them is that the dont do work to any of your vehicles unless it's really needed. They have plenty of work so they are pretty honest about it haha. 

I took my RV in there for an oil change and a transmission flush. They said they would look at the transmission to see if it needed changing and they told me it didn't. I was having some sort of issue shifting. It was the turbo that was lagging. So they told me about it and stated they couldn't work on it because they don't work on that stuff which was a bummer. I trust these guys and wished they could have don't all the work but I'm going to have to find another place. 

Employees are good, detailed and accommodating. For an oil change on an RV they got it done in one day. I am glad they got it done pretty quickly. I had an appointment so I would recommend getting an appointment because they are super busy. 

There is plenty of parking for regular vehicles but if you have an RV it might be tough getting a spot if they have multiple RVs on site. I highly recommend getting an appointment. I definitely recommend these guys. Check them out and thanks for reading my review."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"This dealership practices bait and switch, Twice I have gone out to look at cars that they advertised, for very low prices, both on online car sites and their own website and the car ""wasn't available.""  Both times I called in advance to see if the car was still available and told yes, the second time I asked them to verify that the car was on the lot because of the first experience and they said it was.  Both times they gave no explanation as to why the car wasn't available and tried to sell me a different car.  Both times the car stayed posted on their website and other online sites for at least a week after they told me it wasn't available.  Once the car was removed from their website only to pop back up a week later.  In that instance the CarFax report listed the car as having been sold a few days before the first ad appeared and registered with the state under a new owner a week before the second ad appeared, making it unlikely that it was a sale that fell through.  Because I am taking my time looking for a car and using several different search sites I was able to notice this, I would assume since most people spend only a week or two looking for a car they would not notice repeated ads for cars that are not available when you go to look at them. I have reported them to the attorney general but I would be surprised if anything gets done about it.  At least I can warn people off of them on here."

The sales manager, Aaron, was extremely helpful and made sure I was comfortable. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car.The staff was very helpful.  I was in and out in under an hour and they did a great job.  I will definitely be back!I used to love this place. But after years of not having my car washed I decided to give it a try. I needed a basic wash, which is usually a good deal, but the employees were really friendly and efficient. I paid $10.00 for the full service and they did a fantastic job. I went in to get my car washed, and the guy was super friendly. I went to pay for the basic wash, and he wasn't sure how to do it. I went back the next day and asked to have the car detailed, but they didn't do it. The guy didn't even bother to wipe down the inside of the door jams, which is a plus, and it was a huge waste of my money. I spent! I don't recommend this place at all other places.I had a great experience at this place and will go back in January 2015, but I had an oil change my oil change my oil change oil change, but they charged"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"This is an update on my review, as well as the manager.

The person who was supposed to be the service manager, Steve, is the most unprofessional, and rude person I have ever met. He is a complete jerk. He is unprofessional and disrespectful. He is a complete jerk.

I will never ever go back to this dealership again. I will never recommend anyone to buy a car from them. They are too friendly and down to earth.I have been to this location for a few years.  I have been bringing my car here for the past several years, and have always had great service.  The staff is professional, polite and efficient.  I highly recommend this location.I went to get my car washed. It's $5 and it was a horrible job. It took over an hour to get my car washed. They had no clue what was going on and didn't even try to get to it. My car was still dirty and they didn't even wash it. I was very disappointed with this place.I recently purchased a vehicle from them and was very disappointed. The first I had to get a new windshield on my car. I took it to the dealer to have it fixed and it fixed.   I received the same day it back to get the service and the same day and they said I bought it was done it, they charged me"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I was in Tom Wood Nissan last week to check out and maybe finalize the new Altima 2013.
I spoke to Josh ans he was quite helpful in explaining features of the car and giving test drive. But the problem i had was when it came down to price. While i was negotiating, his manager came in to the room and asked me what car am i looking at. I told him Altima 2013 and he said that i am looking at the wrong car. It would not come in the price range. I had told Josh that i had my check book and was willing to do the deal but it seems the Manager does not know how to value the customer.

He also said that in such a rude manner as if he was doing me a favor by keeping me there. I had quoted initially $20000 for a 2013 Altima which is not too low from the MSRP and i was willing to go higher as i really liked the car. I was very impressed by the 2013 altima and would have bought the car on display . But after speaking to the manager i gave up on that dealership. If someone is treating me like that even before having my business then why would i buy from such a place. As a customer i have every right to negotiate- if he is willing to give that then great, if not -then there is always a professional way of saying that.
Anyway as soon as i came out of Tomwood I went to the Honda store nearby and got a good deal and good customer service- which lead to them having my business."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"UPDATE: We went to Aamco to meet the tow truck driver to get my childs car picked up but of course it started right up. We were told multiple times that they couldn't get it started even though we drove it in. My child did receive a call telling them that they would be giving a full refund. So I will change my 1 star review to 2 star.

I would NEVER use SPAAMco for any service. The men that helped my child were unprofessional at so many levels, to make a long story short. We had to send her step dad and a family friend (2 separate visits because no one was getting  any answers) to try to figure out what was going on after my child was not getting the information needed to find out what was going on with the car.  The Spaamco techs even offered to buy the car at a ridiculously low rate as to screw my child out of their car value. There was absolutely NO customer service. The tech at Spaamco even accused my child of sending 2 men to ""strong arm"" them, when in all actuality the 2 men that came by were her father figures and just trying to figure out what was going on with her car. The car was driven in for a diagnostic test and by they time they were done my child was charged $260 for a diagnostic fee AND the car is no longer running. Which in turn required us to tow it off of their property to have it fixed by a real mechanic with actual customer service skills. DO NOT GO TO SPAAMCO on State Street!"

I will definitely be back for my next service!  I appreciate it!I recently purchased a brand new Tacoma from Chapman Ford and have had nothing but problems with the service department. They lied about what was happening and why it needed to be fixed. When I went to pick it up, the service advisor said they had found a problem and to bring it in. I said fine. I was told it would be fixed the next day. I made the appointment for the following Monday morning. I arrived at the dealership at 9:15 am and I was told that the truck was not ready. I waited about 20 minutes before they even came to tell me that they had found the problem. I told them I was at work and that I would be there in and I was leaving for the following the day. they offered to call me a loaner. I was told me a loaner vehicle. I had to come back and I said I would be there."
Automotive,3.0,CG,"""Caveat emptor"" just listen to what I wanted. 

I left my car there and got a call from the Sales Manager. He said that he would be there in a minute and that it was ready to go. 

I had to wait several hours for the salesman to arrive and get to the dealership. I was also told that the finance manager would call me back later. I never heard from him. I called back and they told me that the deal was not done and it was ready to go. I drove around the lot, and saw that the car was still sitting on the lot and hadn't been inspected yet. 

I went back to the dealership, and I was told that the car was still sitting on the lot. The salesman said that it was ready. I asked if I could wait for my car to be inspected. He said that the car had not been inspected yet. I went back in and asked to speak with the manager. He said ""Well, we just sold it, but we don't sell cars."" I asked to make sure we didn't have a deposit"". 



I would not buy another vehicle from this dealership.I purchased a car from this place. I had a car that I am now and will not buy a car from another dealer that had an honest salesperson with a similar experience.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"As a woman, I feel confident bringing my vehicle here. They have never had to pay additional charges for services I haven't asked for. Everything is discussed upfront or over a phone call for update so there are no surprises later. I've never had an issue with my bill, the service received, or the way I've been treated. Fair price, relatively quick service and it's not located at some alley. Just across the street there are businesses and even a shopping strip to keep busy if they tell you it won't be too long. ------update 3/6/18------

Five stars again!
For my inspection it didn't pass and he gave me my options. He was patient with my questions, my dad called in and he put up with his questions and he had me out of the shop yesterday afternoon after I brought it in the morning. ---update 3/23/18---

Let me start by saying I HATE THE CRATER POT HOLES IN PHILLY! flat tire, bent rim. But here we are. Obrien's patched me up and fixed my rim. This would be a happier review if I want reviewing him so often :( 

--- update 12/10/18---

Squeaky breaks? No more! I was away on travel and the squeaking on my breaks was really concerning me. I figured I'd drop the car off at pep boys during my conference and biggest mistake ever. By the time I drove home (100+ miles) I was pushing the pedal way further than felt natural just to get my car to stop! 

Came back to O'briens and he fixed what ever it was they unfixed over there. As usual, my bill was fair, he called me with options and I'm not scared to drive my car."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"So I was looking around for a full detail and to get some very minor scratches taken out, I've gotten several quotes or flat rates and they ALL were between $275-$375 except for THIS ""company"". The owner started out with an estimate of $249-$279 then once i told him i scheduled with another company for $300 he said ""i can do all that for you for $300"" then he starts dividing the detail into separate appointments telling me he can do the detail first for $249 then come back and do the headlights for $59 each headlight then tells me ""or i can do the headlights the same day as the detail for $100 each light, WOW!! He then tells me the minor snow removal scratches will cost $275 to remove from my hood, i will include pictures to show you how MINIMAL they really are! So now we're up to $642 IF we split it up into several appointments and i agree to have my car maintenances done with them weekly or monthly. The owner then tells me ""idk why you would want a paint restoration done on such an older car"", again, WOW! First off getting my cars detailed is nothing new to me, my dad owned his own shop for over 23 years and I'm VERY familiar and i do know that the headlights and any minor surface scratches would be apart of a FULL DETAIL. I am good without the $700+ car detail from this company, I'd look somewhere else if i were you. He also told me there's no set price until they get to you and see the car and prices will go up from there! NO THANKS!!!"

I was assured by the manager that they would look at it and see what they could do to make it right. I waited and waited for the next day and was told that it would be done the next day.

I explained that the car had been in the shop for over a month and that I wanted to make sure it was on the road.  He said he would have it delivered to me by the next day.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Everything went smooth and as expected with the windshield replacement.  The technician was polite and informative.  Unfortunately, the review mirror broke off and my effort to get it fixed the same day was not very pleasant.  I wanted it fixed the same day to avoid any damage to the sensors from the weight of the mirror and the swaying back & forth.  I called the 800# and Mary was able to get an appointment schedule for the following morning at my place of employment.  But since the nearest Safelite is less than a half mile from my office, I asked if it was possible for someone to quickly run over to fix it the same day.  She transferred me to the local office and I spoke with Danah who seemed to have an attitude - as if I was inconveniencing her to do her job.  I was told my only option would be to bring the truck to the Safelite shop.  Later I spoke with Tracy who was not much friendlier, and she suggested I bring the truck after lunch around/little after 1pm - that the job should only take 10-15 minutes.  I arrived around 1:15pm and the technician in the garage told me he had 4 cars in front of me and couldn't promise when he would get to it.  He told me there wasn't a manager onsite, and I wasn't about to talk with the ladies in the front office again.  Moral of the story - the staff at the Safelite on 86th street (Indianapolis) should work on their customer service skills!  And I would recommend using their off-site technician service."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"WORST Decision I Have Ever Made was entrusting this place with my vehicle.

I dropped my car off here and was told that I would have it back in 4 days. I took it in on a monday morning and waited for a call on thursday that never came... On friday I drive up and my car was nowhere to be seen, and of course they had an excuse. ""It should be ready first thing monday morning."" Again...NO CALL. I call tuesday, another excuse. This went on for 14 DAYS!!! They kept my car 10 DAYS LONGER THAN THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE! Not only do they take more than 3x longer to repair the car, they hand me a bill that was nearly TWICE THE PRICE they said it would cost. 

To top it off, I'm looking my car over before leaving and I noticed some sort of adhesive/glue on my leather passenger seat. When I showed it to them they BLAMED IT ON ME and said, ""oh that was already there""! I just shook my head and walked off in disbelief. 

Let's do a recap:
`They keep your car 3x longer than they tell you  
`Over-charge by double
`Never call you to let you know what is going on
`Rude & Unfriendly customer service
`Blame you for their mistakes

ALL CARSTAR locations are NOT created equal. The motto of this particular location should be: OVER-PROMISE, OVERCHARGE, UNDER DELIVER...CUSTOMER IS NEVER RIGHT!

I am completely amazed that in 2012 with the openness of the internet, a business like this will treat their customers so poorly. That's why websites like Yelp were created, to share our experiences...whether they be good or bad...

It is now May 2018 and our car is not even a year old, our engine light comes on and find out that there is a problem with the car, thank God under warranty. What is bad is the service department, they not only kept our car for almost a week but every time Curtis said he would call me he never would unless I did. Before picking up our car we installed a brand new pair of wipers for 32.00 before bringing the car in 2 mos. before engine light came on. Curtis calls me today telling me I needed an oil change and a pair of brand new wipers as the ones I have on now are not touching the windshield. The day before bringing our car in I used those wipers and they were working great, we called Tad the service manager as on my husbands way home the wipers were making a  loud noise and were not working right, we told Tad the service manager about it and asked us who we worked with and told him Curtis. He transfers us to Curtis and Curtis tells  my husband we are lying. He told us to go out and buy new ones and they would give us our money back and they will replace them free. He said they were old and we know they were brand new. How nice! I will never trust a company who lies and tries to get you to spend more money than you have. Someone there messed with our wipers while doing their inspection on the car and then lied about it."

Yes, it's super convenient, but the fact that they were the hub for pump fraud (1k charge to credit card at pump thank god for fraud alert at my bank) but the final nail was service I didn't receive when I definitely needed help. It was raining and I stopped to put air in my tires, got $1.50 in quarters and the pump was malfunctioning and let air out of two tires. The spout wouldn't seal on the invalves. When I went in for help, I was told by Kaheem that no he couldn't help me. No he couldn't come out to see if the pump was malfunctioning as I'd stated, to which he also said it had to be my tires (which I went to another station and it worked just fine). He then told me the air pump wasn't his responsibility because it's a public service item. He wouldn't reimburse my money. I was very calm in all this never raising my voice, but even when I told him my tire was now less than 100psi and I was scared to drive it, he said he couldn't help. I am extremely disappointed in this station. I suggest you prepay gas and save all receipts, and don't depend especially on this cashier for assistance. The cashier couldve saved this rating if he had at least tried to come help me, offered a solution of some sort, reimbursed the money or at least offered apologies for the broken item and tell me it would be fixed so others wouldn't suffer."

The dealer had no legal right selling that car.  WHY WAS IT ON THE LOT WITH A STICKER???  She had a legal signed contract.  Of course, being 20 years old and buying her first car she was soooo upset.  Dealer did nothing to help with this matter because I guess they couldn't believe we were UPSET!  Kent Brown the General Manager was NOT very sympathetic, in fact, he said since we were already upset with the dealership they didn't want to do anything for us, because we were not coming back anyway.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"DO NOT GO TO OCTOPUS
After giving this place multiple second chances I'm done!   
THREE reasons to avoid this place for washing your car.
1. DAMAGE to vehicles!  
- I have multiple cars now damaged at this Octopus Car Wash!  First was a two year old vehicle were a cleaner broke one of the vents inside. 
- Second was BRAND NEW car!  Scraped up the LED Screen and the dash wiping things down with a dirty gritty rag!!!!!  Scratches everywhere in a car with only 175 miles!!!!!  Also a bumper scratch on rear bumper....  Vehicle left dealer in Scottsdale, ONLY ONE stop after the dealer was at the car wash to clean it up before taking home!
- PickUp were employee was wiping down car with big belt buckle scratching up the truck as he leaned against the vehicle... Stupid! 
2. Jerks Managing the Place!
- ""Oh, I apologize sir!"" is NOT enough when you cause $1000's in damage on a new car with 175 miles after claiming ""It's just regular wear & tear""
- Other manager claimed broken vent must have been that way!  No it wasn't. 
- Supervisor even watched guy drag belt buckle across another car fender I pointed out.... Had the gall to say ""Can you prove that damage wasn't there before you came here?  We get people scamming us all the time.""   Essentially implying that I'm trying to rip them off!
*** No appropriate resolution!
3. Consistently Poor Cleaning:
- Regularly didn't wipe down car leaving it with water spots and dirty.   
- Often forget to vacuum the passenger side floor boards thinking as a driver you won't notice.

The next day I loaded up my son and our bikes in the truck and drove down to Fosters to leave my truck for repairs.  When I went into drop off the keys and fill out the paperwork the man working the counter said he needed to check to make sure they could do the work.  He came back and said that they needed to ""check it out"" and that their subscription to the service that would fix the computer had expired.   I asked him why they told me to come down if they were unable to help  and his reply was ""Roy's out of town until Monday""   This made no sense to me but whatever.   Then they asked me to leave the truck so they could look it over and they would get back to me with an estimate for the work that was needed.  This left me with the feeling that they were trying to bait and switch me so  I loaded my son and myself back in to the truck and that will be the last time I ever bring a vehicle to Roy Fosters Automotive."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"So we decided to try this place out. We decided to go back for a full detail and we were so impressed. The people were very friendly and the car looked so great. The only thing that was disappointing is that the guy who came out was not very friendly. He had no idea what was going on with the car and just seemed very annoyed and didn't seem to care. I wish I would have known better. Then, I came back to get a car wash and paid for the full service wash. The car was clean and I was actually not even in a rush to get it done. So, I was a little apprehensive. But, I did not feel like I was being ripped off by any other place. I got my car washed for $30 and was shocked to find out the car was not even detailed. My seats weren't cleaned either. They had no vacuum or wipe down the seats. I asked to have them vacuum the dash and they said they didn't do that. When I went to get the car washed, it was still dirty. I had to ask them to wipe down the dash and they would not do the tires and wipe down the console. They did not wipe down the doors. I had to vacuum the interior and the dash. It was really disappointed me. I just so I asked them to clean the floor mats. They were not even had a huge waste my seats."

The staff is always friendly and professional.  I have a 1999 Volvo that was having problems with the timing belt.  I brought it in for a check up and told them I had a problem with the belt and needed to get a new belt.  I had to call them several times to check the belt and was told that they were able to replace the belt but they couldn't find a way to fix it.  

I brought my car in for a routine oil change and was told that it would take about an hour or so to complete the job.  I gave them a call and waited for them to take a look at my car.  I was told that I had a bad belt and they had to replace the belt.  I was told that my belt would need to be replaced, but that I would have to pay for the belt to be replaced.  I was told that they would need to order parts, but they would call me when they found it.   I called them back later that day and asked if I had any parts were available.  and they were available to order parts were available.   I was told they would be there.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"I was a little iffy about going to Jiffy Lube (no pun intended) ;-) I have always brought my car to the dealership or to a trusted garage. But this time I didn't have many options. I have to say I was very pleased with my visit. I called before going to see if their was a long wait. The man on the phone was very friendly (hard to find that now a days) and was very inviting. He ensured me my car would be in and out in 10 min. When I got there, they took my car right away. After just a few min. In the waiting room (which has a tv, bathroom, and coffee) a woman came to get me to go over my info and pricing. The only thing I could slightly have to complain about is that she was new and she messed a few things up. Had to give her all my info twice. And she tried charging me $124.00 for my oil change. She had clicked on the wrong code in the computer. I told her I never paid that much in my life and the most I ever had to pay was $80.00. So, in the end, it was $80.00 (after I had a $10.00 off coupon) I can accept some small mistakes as I was once new at what I do too, so it happens. They also were able to replace my headlight that went out. After my car was finished, they come and tell you, and after you pay, there's a guy waiting at the door holding it open for you and hands you your keys. He even opened my car door for me. I would definitely recommend this place."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"So this week I found myself short on spare time but also seriously overdue for an oil change. I usually bring my car into the dealer or a service center, but this place happened to be on my way, very quick and advertised an $18.99 special so I decided to give it a shot. When I arrived there was another car being serviced in front of mine. I waited about 5-10 minutes and then I was instructed to pull into the bay, which I did and I waited for my turn 

As I'm waiting I overhear the tech who "" directed me in "" mention to a male customer something along the lines of ""man, I swear women can't drive or listen to instructions, they so dumb"". 

Um really?! Perhaps he did not realize my windows were rolled down when he made that commentary. So, since I was already there and just wanted to get done and leave, I decided to ignore that comment and soon someone else began working on my car. Took about 10-15 minutes for the oil change. 

When it was done and they brought me the bill, there was a mysterious add on charge (no surprise there!) for what they said was the ""specialty"" oil filter required for my car. Well that's funny because I was never told of this at any point since I've owned my vehicle, but again, I didn't have the time or patience to haggle with them about it.

At the very least I got a quick oil change and scratched another thing off the to do list for the day. On the other hand, I will probably go to my usual place in the future and doubt I would come back here"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Awful customer service experience, will not be back. Went in to get my tire patched and the guy who helped me was a nice guy. He said the tires were in great shape and that it was a little overpriced. I will never go back. This is my second time going here and I will not be going back. I will never be back. I will tell everyone I know to stay away from this place. This place is great. I came in to get a tire patched and they were able to get me in immediately. I was in and out in 15 minutes. I'm super happy with the service I received and will be returning here. This is my second time using this service center and both times I have been happy with the service and the service I have received. I recently had the unfortunate experience of having my vehicle serviced at this location. I had a bad battery that was draining the battery in my vehicle. I was told by the service representative that they would be able to get it fixed in a couple of days. I waited two weeks for the battery to be replaced, and still no one was ordered. When I called and was told that the service advisor told me the service was on the battery was on hold would be sent over and it would be in. I would be sent over an hour to be there. I waited another hour."
Automotive,4.0,OR,"Well I arrived at 12:30 on Wednesday for my first oil & filter change and rotate on my new Explorer (2nd new car purchased in 12 months from Two Rivers). I was told upfront that it would take 1 1/2 hours which was fine.  I ask for a loaner (none available), I asked for a ride home (ok but no one to pick you up in the afternoon) so I sat in the waiting lounge.  No coffee in their free coffee pot. Several employees came up for coffee as well but no one would make more.  So 2 hours passed and I approached my service advisor to ask the status of my car.  Well it was not even on the rack and they still had 3 ahead of me. (although I was the only one in the waiting lounge). So I took my car out.  He offered to send me to Hertimage Quick Lane 20 minutes away (Bates Ford in Lebanon is closer). I said no thanks 4 hours already spent on nothing done yet.  I understand remodeling but tech shift management is 101 in service.  Offering a car or ride when you can't handle the problem might work.  No. I had to return the next day and spend an additional two hours of my life at the place I had spent $70,000 in cars in 11 months. At least this time they gave me a ride home and back and I was able to get a few things done in my other car.  First service experience was a little flat but I still like the dealership and it's personnel.  You need a Quick Lane with 12 stalls at this rate."

Automotive,1.5,OR,"Buyer Beware!

Delta Auto Protect is unfortunately a money grab.  I purchased the warranty for my 2010 Mini Cooper S.  Several months after purchasing the warranty, while driving to work, the car began to smoke and lose power.  I immediately pulled over to a safe location and called Delta Auto, requesting information on how to submit a claim.  Initially, they were very helpful, walking me through the process.  I was able to get a tow to my mechanic (ASE certified) for diagnosis.  He worked with Delta Auto and they sent an independent investigator to evaluate the issue with my mechanic.  The ultimate root cause was a coolant hose line that ruptured without warning and caused the motor to overheat.  There was no indication that this was a lingering issue, as several months prior to this, the car was at the shop for general maintenance.

In the end, they made the decision to not cover the repairs due to the hose line being the root cause.  Now, their contract does state that hose lines are not covered but that should not include the damage that they cause when such a rupture occurs.  Basically, this is their way out of covering repair costs.  Also, as a warning, the analyst that informed me that they were denying the repair was condescending and rude. I have since cancelled the warranty effective 12/19/2017 but have yet to receive a refund of the remaining balance.  Their cancellation document states that I will have it within 15 days, so taking the holidays and business days into account, it should be in my possession by tomorrow, 1/11/2018.  If not, I will be seeking legal action for breach of contract."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I made an appt to have 2 issues looked at and asked for an estimate to repair.  I checked in 15 mins early, asked about how long it would take them for them to look at my car and was told it would be about an hour.  After an hour and a half, I found my service advisor and asked what was taking so long as I merely wanted an estimate to repair.  He went to find out and told me they hadn't finished looking at the car and it would be another 25-30 minutes wait.  I asked for my car back and the advisor asked if I wanted to make an appt for another time.  No way!  I already made an appointment and wasted an hour and a half.  Absolutely unacceptable!  Forget that they didn't even get to my car - customer service 101 - keep the customer apprised of what is going on!  I realize this advisor is seeing car after car pull in, but keep track of your appts.  If someone has been there for an hour and is waiting for an estimate, let them know you are running behind, can't figure out what is wrong, or whatever the case may be.  That might not make me thrilled, but I would rather be informed, than not.  So disappointed in the lack of customer service and that is really the number one reason I will not go back.

I declined, and he said it would take about an hour, and I would get a call when it was done.

The next morning, I called the dealership, and they said they could do it, and I was in and out in about an hour.  I went in to pick up my car, and the guy was super nice, and the manager, Josh, was super nice.  I was in and out in no time.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"These guys really deserve all their stars. I got a discount card in the mail for a $19.99 oil change so I figured why not. The place that I usually go to just closed for business so I was looking for somewhere to go for cheap oil changes. This Valvoline location has 2 bays available and is a drive thru service. I NEED drive thru because taking all 4 of my children into a waiting room and being made to sit all day is a big hassle. When I pulled up I was greeted and asked what service I was looking for. I told them the oil change and was told it would be about a 35 minute wait. Normally that's a bit long but I could clearly see that only one bay out of the two was available because of a bigger issue with the 2nd vehicle inside. No problem for me. The long wait might be an issue for some but if you think about it 1) this isn't always the case and 2) no appointment necessary. Just leave and come back later. Really...no big deal. The customer service was fantastic. I upgraded and got a few things extra, not because they were being pushy with offers, but because I really needed those extras taken care of such as wiper blades and air filter. I even told the manager that I wasn't looking to spend over x amount of dollars and he was able to give me discounts that met my budget. I drove away feeling like I got one hell of a deal! Everything separate would have cost me well over the price they charged and that's not counting labor cost. I will definitely be going back to this location!"

With that information I decided that I would take the appointment. When I arrived they told me that the price would be $49.95, and when I mentioned that I was quoted a different price they did not care. As that's only a $10 difference I decided it wasn't a huge deal and went inside to wait. An hour passed, and my car still was not done. I continued to wait and then after about 2.5 hours, I decided to ask if they had an estimate of when it may be done. They explained to me that they normally have 3 people working but today only had 1. Understandable, but then why did they tell me my service would take an hour? So I asked when my car would be done and they told me maybe another 30-45 minutes because they had only just begun working on it. Finally, when my name is called,  and after paying $57, I go to get my car and it is nowhere. I can hear the employees discussing how they are looking for my keys, but to my face they just tell me that my car is being pulled around. I stood in their service garage for around 10 minutes before an employee finally realized where my car and keys were. If I were told proper information from the time I called I would not have gone in for this service today. Just awful."

This will be reported to as many consumer protection and government regulatory departments as I can get to listen starting with The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' Division.

That's OK with me because I want to look at the vehicle to see if it is worth my time. As with all used cars there are some issues with the vehicle but overall it looks like a vehicle she would be happy with. WE go to leave and FINALLY someone comes out. So when we ask for the price of the vehicle the salesman gives us a price $3K over advertised price? WTF? So here is the dirty advertising this place attempts to sneak past the hoodwinked shopper. He tells us all the way at the very bottom of the website page that there is a small orange rectangular button that says in small print ""disclaimer"" and there you find that the price doesn't include what they feel is a reasonable down payment of $3K! And we haven't even gotten to the gouged finance percent! Once we gave the salesperson (or lackthereof) the ""you gotta be frikkin' me?"" look he quickly became dis interested said ti us goodbye and walked away.

Automotive,1.5,OR,"Very bad, this place deserves 0 stars, but yelp will not allow it. Just some words of advice.

If you drive off the lot it's going to be a 995$ fee along with 0.99 cent per mile driven off of the deposit that you made, make sure that you get a copy of everything you signed that day, just because you have the receipt does not mean they will give you a full refund in the original payment method. Also be sure to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic no matter how new you think it is. If you still decide to buy (not recommended) know that whatever price you see on the website, there is an additional ""Non-governmental Tag Agency/Courier Fee $125 and Electronic Registration Filing Fee $579, a $1,995 fee, Destination Charges $1050, Document Processing Fees $995 Reconditioning Fees (will vary depending on the vehicle)."" A 18,000 used car can easily become 26,000 with them. Also, you might have to come back because the finance department is backed up, and don't bother asking any of the salesmen question they don't know until you speak to finance. Also check the Kelleybluebook value if KBB is telling you the car is worth 25,000 and they are selling it for 19,000 it is not a good car. How would they be able to stay open selling cars undervalue like that they wouldn't be able to make a profit. But please don't take my word for it check them out on Better Business Bureau, or Yelp, or their review section on Facebook. Anyways just because they are a small business does not mean that they will look out for the little guys, or your interests no matter how friendly or cool, or nonchalant your salesperson seems."

It's bad enough that they added all these random charges to the selling price, but then they threatened my safety by sending me off in a car they knew wouldnt even get me home (since I live in NC). As if this wasnt the icing on the cake, once I finally called to raise hell they agreed to reimburse me for my repair expenses- well it took 3 months of harassing them on a weekly basis to finally get that check, and guess what... IT'S $42 short of what they were supposed to pay me!!! Now, in the large scheme of things, what is $42, right?

They always worked with me to understand the features on the car I was buying and how much it was going to cost, without the back-and-forth bickering.

Service:
They have always been great with their service department. They get you in and out in a reasonable period of time. The service advisors are knowledgeable and courteous.

Events: (see pics!)
Occasionally they will hold events through either Reeves or Bmw corporate. I have been to a few and all were great! I went to a special event, today held by BMW corporate. They invited me (and many other owners) to a BMW autocross driving event at a track in St. Petersburg, Florida. They had instructors that were professional drivers on the track. They helped us learn better driving skills with turning, breaking, and overall speed on this type of course. All while going as fast as we could! So much fun! Thank you! 

Highly recommend!"
Automotive,3.5,OR,"I would have to say my experience has not been so great. I arrived to my scheduled appointment 15 minutes early and was told that everyone will be going to lunch at noon and it was 11:15. Next I was told my vehicle might have to stay overnight because they're backed up. I told them I couldn't because I was getting something replaced and would go somewhere else because it seemed ridiculous. After saying that, another gentleman said it would be done by 3pm. I agreed to leave my vehicle and waited to picked up by their shuttle service. As I was waiting, I asked the receptionist how much for an oil change? She replied, ""it can be anywhere from 55 to 75 for oil change."" I stated to her that I haven't had to pay more than 39 plus tax for the standard. She stated that it was probably because of the special. I also knew when Ford has a special, it list it at 29 which I viewed on Ford's website. Later, my husband picked up the vehicle and got the report. When I got off work and looked at it, I noticed a check mark on the red box indicating something about the battery. I asked my husband if SB FORD mentioned anything upon picking it up and he said no. I called up another Ford dealer because of the lack of customer service I had and wanted a second opinion since my vehicle is not even a year old. Today, 2/24, I dropped my vehicle off at another Ford dealer to test the battery, and the results were it needed a new one. My frustration with Perry Ford is on what they found and about replacing it since it was under warranty."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"Avoid this ""dealer"" at all costs. The dealership is a joke. The person who sold us our car had a bad attitude. He said he would call me back in 5 minutes. He never did. Finally, I called the dealership. They said they had two cars that we were interested in. They said the car had been sold. So we waited for the salesman to call me back. We waited for him to call us back. He never did. Finally, he called us back in 5 minutes. The salesman had a bad attitude and he was actually nice. We sat down with him and he continued to try and up-sell us. We finally got a deal, but we were promised the car was sold. We went home and bought the car. The next day we went back to the dealership to sign papers and get a deposit. We had to go back to work to sign paperwork. We had to get a deposit on the car that was not there. The next day the salesman called us back to say he was getting another deposit and would call us back. So we did. No one called back and was there. Finally, no one called back. We waited. We told him we were given a deposit. He called again. No one told him we needed to come pick up and leave a deposit and we said he would pick up. We were ready to come back. So we were told him up."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I had an issue with this Midas when i found that i was charged for services that were never actually completed. I had a bill just under $1000, and when I went to get a second opinion on my vehicle (Immediately after leaving here) I found that not only would my car not pass inspection, but it was incredibly dangerous to drive. While I was charged for an alignment and an inspection, this would have been impossible to complete as there was a good 4 inches of wheel play in my driver side tire, and in fact the hub had to be completely replaced (I found this out 5 minutes after leaving Midas) So the next day I return asking why I was charged when this could not have been done. I am a young woman in my early twenties, so it is already daunting to go into a mechanic shop alone, luckily I know enough about cars to speak intelligently about them. Well instead of the manager working with me or explaining things in a calm manner, he ends up approaching me threateningly and screaming in my face about how I do not respect my elders (Because i had asked him to lower his voice) and how a ""teenager will not tell him how to talk"" and I had better ""Watch my tongue before I opened my mouth to him."" Luckily there was another woman in their waiting room who was having her car worked on, and agreed to be a witness to this situation if I decided to take action from it (which I have.) Not only would I not recommend this shop to anyone, but I have actually told all of my friends, peers, colleagues and family to avoid this shop at all cost."

Automotive,2.5,OR,I purchased a Toyota RAV4 a few months ago and was pretty happy about the way the sale went and the deal I got. Yesterday the car would not start. I wound up having to have it towed to peruzzi. I was told the battery went bad and that it would be 160.00. I was confused as to why I would have to pay for a battery that shouldn't be dead after a short time. I emailed Dana who had sold me the car and told her I didn't think I should be having issues already with the car and that I'd gotten a new car to avoid issues like this like I had with my last car. She told me she would speak to the manager and get back to me. She never got back to me. I went to Peruzzi after work to pick up the car and find out what was going on. When I complained about the charge I was talked to like I was ridiculous and like it was an annoyance. They told me that this new battery would be covered if anything happens to it but yet the one before wasn't??? They gave me a few dollars off and acted like it was so hard to get that done and basically told me that was the best they were going to do. I've never felt so insulted and dismissed as a customer in my life. I will never refer anyone and I certainly won't be buying another car from there. They sell you a car and then it's your problem if there are issues. They don't care. I'm very disappointed. Not to mention the cargo shade was never put back in my car when it was detailed and not replaced. Not happy.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Unfortunately I have had poor service after poor service at Waterloo Ford. After purchasing my 2015 Ford Escape in September, everything just seemed to go downhill from there. When I went to pick up my new vehicle, not only was the sales consultant not ready to bring the vehicle up front, there was no gas in the tank, the keys could not be found, and the vehicle manual was nowhere to be found. The sales consultant did not go through the vehicle with me and I was left to found a scratch on it on my own. I was promised that follow up would be given in regards to same, but have yet to get that phone call. I had previously purchased a Ford Fiesta at the same dealership and in the months that followed, I received multiple phone calls per day in regards to my Ford Fiesta (which I no longer owned, which was traded in back to that SAME dealership). When I attempted to call back and ask why I was being called for a vehicle I no longer owned, the response I got was ""Well we wouldn't call you for that."" I decided to give them another try and use their service department for my first oil change and to check the coolant level on my new vehicle has it should not be as low as it currently it. I booked an appointment on a Tuesday for service using their online service booking and was expecting a follow up call within 24 hours (as stated on their website) to confirm my booking for the Friday.

I'm also going to say that the last time I went to this place, I didn't get my oil changed, I just got my car washed and a vacuumed, I don't have to get my car washed again.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"A few months ago, I would have given this place 5 stars...I took 3 different cars here and they were great with all of them until the very last time I brought my Civic here.

Yes, you get a quick and clean oil change plus the best ""free"" car wash that anyone could ask for...that much is obvious from their signs and the other reviewers.  But everything else is a little overpriced.  The ""treatments"" they offer to do (transmission flush, fuel system flush, etc) are excessively expensive and may void the warranty on new vehicles.  In addition, the posted price is not for everyone...I've been in there during shouting matches because new car owners were unhappy to hear that their car needed a special oil filter and they were charged 5 dollars extra.  I really didn't mind any of this stuff because I never had a problem...then I did.

Unlike at a dealer, these guys do not replace the washer that reinforces the seal between the oil pan and the drain plug.  So, after numerous times being tightened and untightened, the washer on my car got a little loose and I started to leak oil from the drain plug.  I went back - was treated really poorly and all they did was ratchet down the drain plug harder...they didn't top off the oil to replace what had drained out - and they certainly didn't apologize for wasting my time/gas.

I would just like to be treated a little better when someone messes up the job they are supposed to do right the first time.

In the end, sure...this place is clean and provides a pretty decent deal for your money but just make sure they do the job right before you leave (check under your car for leaks)."

After dealing with their very unprofessional and pathological liar service associate Elena to dealing with the very unprofessional service manager. Having to contact dealership manager that was no better than service associate or service manager. Now I can see clearly why their service team have the issues they have and I am sure they will continue to have them until the dealership goes downhill. Their service team destroyed the rim on my tire, not even two years old Kia Soul. Their dealership manager offered to fix it instead of replacing the entire rim since this was their fault for the lack of training on their service team technicians and have not heard a word from dealership manager as promised. In addition, Elena, the service associate lied about my tire rotation report when I called to ask for tire rotation report that I never received. She did say they had a new system in place and they did not provide tire rotation reports any longer, in which I later found out that was not true. Further, dealership manager offered to fix rim and did say he will call me three weeks ago and up to this date I have not heard a word from dealership manager. I will now contact directly Kia to see what solution they have for me but I can say I will never buy a car from this dealership neither will ever bring my car for service at this dealership.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"The mirror on my passenger side fell off and I had to have it replaced. Not the housing unit to the mirror, literally just the mirror. So I went to Nissan of Reno to have it replaced today. They told me over the phone that the part would be $70 and I that was fine. I was told ""an hour tops"" when I called yesterday and told specifically that an appointment simply wasn't necessary because I'd be able to get in right away. Well, I dropped my car off and walked to Wendy's across the street. When I returned I found my car still waiting to be serviced. 45 minutes and nothing had changed. I spoke the the gentleman inside and he apologized telling me he'd get it taken care of right away. He is the only reason this review has 2 stars and not 1. After discussing prices before the installation I was told $60 for installation and $70 for the part. Yet somehow that part managed to become $80 in the hour between me arriving and me paying. I made them look the part up on their own website and low and behold I was right, it was a grand total of $72.25 for the part on their website. This was corrected since they really didn't have a choice at that point, but the part that still bothers me is that I paid $60 to have someone glue a mirror on my car. If I could get a job gluing in mirrors that pays $60 an hour id be all over it, especially since I watched them do it in the service bay in less than 90 seconds. Not pleased with the company that's supposed to have my back. Next time I'll just do whatever repair it is myself."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"This place is incompetent and does not take responsibility for their work.  Management and the workers are extemely polite and handles themselves well but it is definately a corporate business and has no heart.  

I had a problem with my civic clutch and went in to get it fixed.  I told them I had clutch failure.   They told me the clutch line was leaking. I asked them to fix it.  They told me they tucked the clutch line in and it would no longer leak.  I was happy and paid 254 dollars for the service.  Two days later my clutch failed again on route 73.  I went back this time they said the clutch line was leaking again and would need to be replaced.  They did the work and charge me 320 dollars.  I tried reason with management about why I should be charge so the second time around when they neglected to solve the problem on the first visit but they would not bulge.  

I am not mechanic or attorney but this seems unjust.  They did simple patch work that lasted me 2 days.  They did not take responsibility for the poor work the first time.   Had my clutch failed on the turnpike I could have been in an accident and caused myself and others on the road serious harm.  

Again the staff is very friendly and professional (why i gave it two stars and not 1) but in the end it is a corporate business. I strongly suggest you find a different mechanic.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"I rarely write a really bad or one star review. So when I do, that business has REALLY messed up! 

This company has extremely poor management, they lose keys regularly. It is common for the wrong service to be ordered or performed on a car, leading to poor customer service. 

When I asked how they could possibly lose my keys, the excuse given to me was: Well, we had two Toyota Camrys. SO?! HOW CAN YOU LOSE THE KEYS?! I understand if you get them mixed up with the other Camry, but to LOSE THEM ENTIRELY? How can you not have a key cabinet to hang keys on when the car is not in service? How is this an issue when every other car shop, Quick Lube, even WALMART's crappy service dept. doesn't lose keys! 
When they get it right, it's decent. But this has happened TWICE now that they've lost my keys or my customer's keys and once gave us the wrong keys entirely! Such horrible management there. And then to BLAME THE CUSTOMER because they can't be responsible enough to not lose keys is just atrocious! That's what upset me more than the simple mistake of losing the keys. This is ridiculous. It will take an act of Congress to get me to give this poorly managed company another chance. 

There has been problem after problem here. They've charged for the wrong service, they've charged for the correct service but performed the wrong service. It's been an issue with this company over and over. I've given them multiple chances and it keeps going wrong. This is sad because when they finally do the right job, it's pretty decent and decently priced. But I've had more bad times at this location than good. I don't see how they stay in business."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"The staff here is amazing. Everyone was willing to help, kind and professional. I first reached out to their sales team to get some information on my 2014 F150. I thought that I was going to be horribly upside down on it. I was contacted by Benny Mosqueda quickly and he gathered some more information about my potential trade. I ended up going down to the dealership to talk to him about some of my options. Benny was awesome, he spent time actually listening to what I was looking for and took the time to show me vehicles that fell into my wish list. 
Benny showed me about a dozen different trucks and helped me recognize the differences between them, then I finally made my choice. 

(This next part is what has made me a lifetime customer with Elder Ford.)

After I made my purchase, I went home and began to doubt my decision. This was the closest thing to an anxiety attack that I have ever had. I emailed Benny explaining what was going on at 10:30 pm, then again at 7 am the following morning. To my surprise, he was calm and extremely understanding. I met him at the dealership and this man spent over 2 hours of his time on a Saturday going over literally every detail with me. He wanted to be sure that I knew Elder Ford does not care about sales, they care about the person and finding the right fit for that person.

This has been the best sales experience that I have ever had and I can honestly say that I will be a life long customer.  

If you're looking for a new vehicle or just curious about your current one, go down and ask for Benny Mosqueda.

They will not give me a loaner car for 2 weeks. I have a warranty on the car and it is now 3 weeks later and they have not given me a loaner car. This is a huge inconvenience and aggravation for them to provide a loaner car. It is disappointing to be treated like this and to have to deal with this hassle. My service advisor was even more rude. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dealership. They are dishonest, liars and not really willing to help. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. The dealership is horrible.

While trying to get approved for financing they blasted my application to like 20 banks. It ended up causing 10 inquires on my credit report. My mid FICO was around 720 and My fiances 680 and they got us approved for a 11.5% interest rate. Which is noose bleed high and not what we deserved. Knowing that I could just re-fi a month or 2 later after having driven from Washington DC I just signed the dotted line. 

After a couple months I re-fi the terrible loan and tried to cancel the gap insurance. It basically to an extra 3 months to get it cancelled due to the horrible attitude lady - ""Bernadette Estelow"" that works as head over the finance dept. I would never go back here or ever buy another Honda thanks to this horrible dealership. We also traded in a 2013 Honda-CRZ at the time and in the months leading up to deciding to trade in for the Honda FIT we received numerous mailings from the dealership asking us to trade the car in because they were in very high demand. When we show up to trade the damn car in they tried everything they could to low ball us. Even going so far to say and I quote ""Honda CRZ's dont have very high trade in value."" Honestly it was just ridiculous. How could the Honda dealership spend so much money sending mailings about a car but then try to down play the worth once you show up.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"This place used to be ok - not great, but ok.  At least they (usually) had the cheapest gas in town.  But, the last three times I went in, not only was the car not clean when I left, but they are now cheating on the gas, as well!

The first time I noticed this was three washes ago.  I keep my odometer set on the 'number of miles to next fill-up' setting.  Usually, when I get a fill-up it is around 350 miles to the next fill-up, depending on whether I have been doing city or freeway driving.  Then, three washes ago I was quite surprised to find i had only '310 miles to next fill-up'!!  I thought perhaps they just didn't fill it to the top.

So the next time i went, I checked again.  This time i only got '297 miles to the next fill-up'!!!  Something strange going on here, for sure!

Today, I checked again, and sure enough, this time i only got '287 miles to next fill-up'!!!  So this time, I checked the total gallons put into the car.  It was the usual amount for a fill-up when the tank was close to empty.  What this tells me is that they are SAYING they are putting a certain number of gallons in the tank - and CHARGING FOR IT!  BUT, they are NOT putting all that gas in at all!  Clearly, although the gas is marketed as the 'cheapest in town' - it isn't when they cheat this way!!

So, put together the cheating on the amount of gas they charge for, and the mediocre job they do at washing and vacuuming and what do you think?  I WONT BE GOING BACK AND SUGGEST YOU DON'T GO THERE EITHER!!!!!"

Thank you, Mr. L.I was looking for a new car for my daughter. I was looking for a new car, but unfortunately my daughter was going to be in a car accident, and we ended up with a brand new car. They went above and beyond for us, and were able to get us the car we wanted. I can't say enough good things about this dealership. We went in the next day to look at a used Honda. The salesman, Jim, was very friendly and informative. He even offered to get a good deal on the car I was looking at, and even gave me some tips on how to save money. I don't know much about cars, but I'm very impressed with the whole process. I will be coming back!Went in to purchase a used a vehicle and we were treated like we were treated with respect and respect and I was treated like family.  and this is a valued as a customer.

I was very impressed and would definitely recommend them to others.I came to this location on a Saturday and was greeted by Chris. He was very polite and explained all the services I needed to get my car serviced. I got my car serviced in less than an hour and he was very nice and professional. I will definitely be coming back here for my next oil change. Thank you Chris and the crew.I bought a 2019 Honda Pilot from them and it was a wonderful experience. It was a great experience. I was greeted by Dave, who was very helpful. My salesperson, Jeff, was a pleasure to work with. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. He even offered to get my title transferred to the title department. My experience was great and I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a used car.I recently purchased a used this car from this dealership and the sales person was very nice and I was able to deal with the finance. 
I have a great experience, he was very friendly and great to work with a great experience.

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Bought a truck from these folks. Don't recommend it. Looking for another vehicle, but I'll go elsewhere. Here's why: 1) They shipped the truck to my mailing address instead of home address. I told them it was the wrong address, asked them to verify to make sure. No response. 2) Truck arrived on Sat instead of the Monday that they said it would - I had to cancel meetings and fly back home early just to get it. 3) Truck had no title. When I asked the first time, got no response. The second time, they said it was in the mail to my mailing address. A week later it wasn't there, so I asked for a tracking number. Their response was that ""USPS doesn't provide tracking."" I had just shipped out title paper to another buyer via USPS with tracking, which I showed to them. Instead of coming clean and admitting that they did not pay for tracking on something as important as a title, their response was to attack me for being ""animated"" about it. I find their attitude to be rude, their demeanor to be unprofessional, and their ability to provide a simple action like shipping and mailing to be lacking. As for the truck, not sure why the front left tire had 60psi, the front right tire had 25psi, rear right had 70psi, and rear left had 20psi....very unstable...glad I checked before driving. Not sure they did. At lease now I've lowered my expectations as to the quality of their performance, so I'll be checking the vehicle very carefully and not take anything these folks say as the truth, because they've been provide to be wrong and, if confronted, will get very defensive. Lesson learned. Never again will I buy from them and I will not recommend anyone else does either."
Automotive,1.5,OR,"Well I am in the area just for a couple hours & needed an oil change. It took about 10 minutes, and included a free car wash.  They are very quick, actually so quick that I basically was told ""we are talking longer than it takes"" when I had a few questions because it was my first time there. Ok then.  Rest room was clean and so was the waiting area. 

Giving 1 star because, although the service was quick, my $200 Bose ear buds were on the seat of my car and I noticed they were gone after I left the premises. I returned and the business was closed but the associate who I paid, maybe the manager, was still there & allowed me to check for them with negative results. I usually remove items like that when getting oil changes and because I was rushed, ""we are about to close & need to get you in and out"" I know I forgot to remove them.  

I can't recall which guy pulled my car in or out, so I can't even say who was in my car. It's a loss.

UPDATE: the above incident occurred on a Saturday evening. I returned 2 days later on Monday because it was closed Sunday. I live 90 miles away but felt I had to go back.  What was missing were not $20 earbuds (add another zero to that) After speaking with the Mgr, who did remember me, I asked if anyone turned in my earbuds or maybe had forgotten to do so. He listened intently and said he'd be right back. Ten minutes later, my property was returned to me. 

I was extremely grateful and did mention I would mention it on social media. So the review gets changed from 1 star to 3."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"I called Progressive at 3:20 and asked if they could help me.  They said yes and said they would be there the next morning.  

I showed up at 4:30 and was told they couldn't help me.  I told them I was still waiting and would be leaving a message.  I was told they would call me right back.  At 4:30 I called again and was told they were not able to help me.  I asked for my keys and they said they had no clue about my car.  They said it was not their fault that they needed to help me.  When I asked why they didn't call me to tell me they had been waiting on my car, they said it was their fault and didn't know how they could do anything.  

I called my car dealership and was told that they could help me.  They said they couldn't help me.  They had to order parts and that I had to buy parts from them and they would take care of it.  I took it to another shop to be told they couldn't help me and that I had to pay for them to help me.  and that they would charge me $200.  They said they would give me $100 to fix it.

Automotive,2.0,CG,"This place is the BIGGEST DEALERSHIP in Tucson. The guys here are so friendly and the prices are great. I have had great experiences with this place and I would highly recommend this place to anyone. I've been coming here for about a year now and I will continue to go there. They've also got a nice waiting room with coffee and snacks. I've never had to wait for service before they close or get my car back. They've been very professional and upfront with me on the prices and what was really needed. I have used their services for over 10 years and I've never had any issues. I'm new to the area and went here to get my oil changed. I was told that they have a special deal for oil changes, which is about $20. 99 for regular oil changes. I was not given the discount of $25. 99 for synthetic oil changes. I'm not sure what that means. I'm a female and I don't usually get taken advantage of when I'm female. However, and I feel like being female and I can't be taken advantage of. I have a woman. I don't understand the auto repair places like I know nothing about cars. I just a lot and I don't know I'm being treated me. I'm not a female. But I'm not a woman."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"Unless you are buying a brand new Audi, do NOT waste your time with this dealership. I bought a 2014 used car (not an Audi) and did not feel taken care of by any of the staff. The salesman took advantage of me (probably because I am a young woman), hid reasons for certain fees I was being charged, and even overcharged me for my registration and plate by hundreds of dollars. They did send me a check for a very small refund, but there's no way it was accurate. I am absolutely positive that I was owed around $200 because they promised me a 5 year tag and when I finally received it, it was only for 2 years. On top of all that, when my temp tag expired, they claimed that UPS lost my plate during shipping, and it took an extra 3 MONTHS to get my permanent tag. Whenever I called to discuss the situation, they did not seem to care and I was never a priority. They kept telling me every time that my registration would be there within a day or two, and that went on for those 3 months! So they constantly lied to me over and over again to probably cover their ass. That is your job! How do you not know what you're doing??? I have worked several customer service jobs and have always gone above and beyond for my customers. This dealership is full of money-hungry employees who will not put in any extra effort for you if they don't have to. Maybe if you were there to drop $50k on a brand new Audi, they would treat you like royalty, but even then I highly doubt it. Best of luck if you choose to shop here. Good riddance to having to deal with them ever again!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Apparently, ""FINAL PRICE"" has a whole new meaning at 
Napleton.  They wanted an ADDITIONAL $1600 BEYOND the ""final price"" for things like inspections and cleaning.   They lied and told us those costs were mandated by ""corporate"".    I called corporate and they said they have absolutely no control over how individual (franchised) dealers set their pricing or advertising.  Frankly, they (corporate) didnt seem to care too much either.   This isnt about pricing or negotiating, its about false advertisement and manipulative scheming.  Its unethical, scuzzy business practice. Im going to notify the FTC and BBB. 

We initially test drove and we were $1000 apart in negotiations, since they tacked on their $1600 fluff, so we left.   3 days later, they dropped the internet price by $500.  Youd think they would give us a call to renegotiate since we were serious buyers, but they didnt.    

Our salesperson did not appear to be motivated to sell, as demonstrated by not following up with us after lowering their price, her constant manual use of cell phone during test drive and lack of knowledge of the product she is supposed to be selling.  They pass you off to 4 different people, and no one seems to have any knowledge or authority except for one guy in the back.  Meanwhile, they have 6 employees in the showroom all standing around blabbing with one another.   I'd say it appears more like a jobs program.  Now we can guess why they need to manipulate people into paying the additional $1600 fluff. 

They are so unorganized that they gave my husband the keys and some documents as though he was through but he hadnt even paid for the car yet.

Typical car-selling scuz.  Go elsewhere."

We agreed to take the car in and the service manager called and told us that the car had been in for service since the first service appointment.  We were told that they would have to order the parts and it would be a few days.  The next day we received a call from the service manager that the car would be ready by the end of the day.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I drove my Jeep through the Riptide Car Wash. In the middle of the machine where the top spin brush comes down it got hooked onto my roof light bar and picked up my whole Jeep off tracks for a good 5-7 seconds, pushed the Jeep back as my Jeep was shaking with the side spin brushes still active and spinning. This situation nearly cause the vehicle behind me to hit me. Finally my Jeep was dropped and push through the Car Wash Machine. When I pulled out from the Machine I pulled into the parking area where vehicles vacuum the interior. I got out my vehicle and saw my light bar forced twisted down (facing down) and I looked at the roof of Jeep and I found slices on the roof, light bar is chipped and there's a bent spot on back side of light bar since it was twisted to face down with back of light bar facing to sky. I made a report on same day with personnel and they informed me that a manager would contact me on Monday. I called them Monday afternoon and reach out to a manager that informed me that no one informed them that there was an incident with a a Jeep damage. So the manager informed me he would have the General Manager review the video and contact me. Today (Tuesday) the GM of the car wash just left me a voice message starting he viewed the video and ""clearly"" can see that all the scratches and damage where already on top of Jeep roof prior to entering the machine. No one can visibly see the slices on top unless their eyes can see it in person. I would rate 0 if I could for bad customer service. The car wash doesnt even wash your car properly."

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Absolute worst customer service with inconsistent information at every turn!
I rent frequently and have amassed a few thousand reward points, so I thought I would treat my wife and her sister to a car for their weekend trip to Florida. Knowing how inconsistent the employees at Enterprise can be, I even called the day before to confirm that she could pick up the car with points (something we have done in the past) Naturally, upon arrival at the Tampa Airport Enterprise counter, she was refused a car under the reservation I had secured. She called, handed the phone to an employee and an extremely rude counter employee, told me they couldn't honor the rsvp, then essentially hung up on me!
I spoke with the manager, who was very kind and professional, however contradicted the past employee, who a day before had confirmed that she could pick up the car under my rsvp, using loyalty points. I told my wife to just Uber to the hotel. I called Enterprise customer care, short story...First employee said She should have been able to rent as an added driver/spouse, the next care rep told me I would first have to set up an account and transfer points, taking up to 7 days. I just got an email from someone named Bryan at Enterprise Holdings with the following:
Dear Mr. Mordoh,
Thank you for your feedback regarding your recent experience with us.
Your message and information has been sent to Kevin Moore, Vice President - General Manager and someone will be contacting you. If you would like to contact us directly, call 813-887-4299.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"This review is posted very late. I got my Camry XLE in March 2010 (over 10 years ago) and the whole buying experience was extremely smooth. The salesperson was Steve Reese and I do remember him till date, he was so very professional! In these 10 years, I have relocated from PA to Chicago area, then northern California and finally to Los Angeles area. This car went with me everywhere. Even after 10 years, it was an extremely smooth car, much quieter and comfortable than several contemporary cars. I just sold the car to a very nice family and it went for a very good price. Since I keep my cars for about 10 years, my family decided to go in for an electric car and I just bought a Tesla Model Y; but the ride quality of this 10 year old car was better in my opinion! Had Toyota introduced a complete electric Camry I would have bought it in a heartbeat, and would have asked for help from Steve even though I am now across the other end of the Country! Also another interesting fact: At time of  Camry purchase, it was late in night, cold after dark and an African-American gentleman was working hard waxing my car. I did not get an opportunity to thank him but want to acknowledge his work was excellent. Till the time I owned the car, I always kept it waxed. Also, Ardmore Toyota had kept a complementary hand sanitizer in the center console of the car which I never used. 10 years after purchase, at time of coronavirus outbreak & at time of sanitizer shortage, I somehow found the bottle in the car. It was still sealed well, and had a good alcohol content for sanitizer function and so very useful. So awesome! Thanks Steve and Ardmore Toyota!"

Me and my Family bought a car for our kids. We put over 8 thousand dollars down for a vehicle. We were verbally promised a 2 sets of key. But their word means nothing apparently. And you know how fast these car sharks work. Trying to confuse you with all that paperwork signing. That they slipped the paperwork and signed for 1 key. While it is my fault for not checking the paperwork for what was promised I dont want it to happen to you Make sure that if you buy vehicle from these car sharks and you are promised something you get it in writing before signing anything. It's your money and your future vehicle. Dont let them confuse you at all. I know the excitement of getting a vehicle can make you crazy. But watch out for Rackley dishonest auto group.

Update: The promises were made verbally.  But as I stated your company and salesman said the would look into it even while we were there purchasing the vehicle. But all your salesman see is a sale and commission money in their pocket and screw the customer at any cost. After buying many vehicles from many dealerships the rhetoric is the same. Even while I was signing the paperwork your salesman who sold me the car stated that he would be in contact with us with the spare key. Yes it's my fault for signing my soul to the devil and not getting what was promised. I wrote this review to let people know what your all about and for future customers to not be taken advantage and to ask for things in writing so that things like this don't happen to them. You can spin it however you want. I wont take your offer on the key as we went with a reputable dealer."

Automotive,3.0,OR,"This place is the worst place to buy a car truck SUV anything! I SIGNED a contract stating I would pay a certain amount, spent about 4 to 5 hours going through paperwork. Drive the truck off the lot and come to find out a couple days later that the legal document I signed didn't mean anything because they didn't get an approval from the bank at the rates they had given to me. So I drive back to the dealership to speak with Ryan Smith and MR. Smith goes on to tell me immediately that I need to sign a new contract at different rates. Awfully persistent I reject his offer. With his offer I could have just pulled out with a brand new truck off the lot . I ask him about the special rebates going on with the trucks he tells me they change by month . Mind you I had taken out my truck just a couples days ago which would still be the month of September! He then comes back with another deal saving me ""a lot "" of money , at that point I was over it! This guy was absolutely the worst guy to work with. For a manager he sure did his best to not to do his job. I reject his last offer and he tells me to give him the keys .  I drive across town in traffic to take out my belongings come back give my awesome sales rep Justin the keys and leave with my down payment check and absolutely no receipt or statement stating that any of this happened. Worst experience of my life!!! I am now purchasing the same truck with better mileage and price at Mercedes Benz of Reno having it shipped here to Reno NV ! Shout-out to Mercedes BenZ of Reno !"
Automotive,4.5,OR,"Please, please, please do not take your car here for service.  I can't speak to the sales side of their business but after being completely ripped off for thousands of dollars (yes, thousands) trying to have my aging VW Passat repaired, I wouldn't dream of buying a car here. I took my 10 year old, much loved Passat here for service/repair.  I knew it was in need of serious maintenance and was willing to pay a reputable dealer to fix it and fix it right. My biggest regret is that I thought Falcone was the place.  I had my car in there a total of 3 times over the winter and every time I picked up it, it would break down again within days.  Sometimes within hours.  I am not exaggerating nor making any of this up.  And each time I would bring it back, it would be more and more money to have it ""fixed"".  I don't (or didn't ) question whether or not the car needed the repairs, my problem at that time was why were the issues NOT caught intially, before I picked the car up from them?  One thing after another until I finally told them I was out of money and out of patience.  They were finally able to fix it enough for me to keep it out of their shop for a couple of months before it broke down again (with something they assured me had been fixed the last time) I took my car to a different place this time and the mechanic there told me that he honestly couldn't tell that they had fixed anything on the car or done anything besides cleared the codes.  Please be warned, unless you like throwing your money away, take your car somewhere else for repair."

Automotive,4.5,OR,"I don't typically self-wash my truck, but had to give this place a try after some special circumstances. 

While cleaning my desk at work, I encountered four Dalee tokens which I'm assuming were left by the last employee whom had sat at my spot. I figure, this place is close by my apartment and has always seemed clean and well-functioning each time I've driven by, so why not give it a try?

I stopped here this morning after finishing my morning coffee at the French Press, which is conveniently located across the street. On that note, this car wash is in a wonderful, central location to all things downtown - love it. 

I was delighted to see that the four tokens on my person equated to a minute apiece with either the self-serve station machine or the vacuuming bays. I was also delighted to see that this spot will accept credit cards for payment. 

The car bath was bustling with several other patrons looking to get their vehicles cleaned before the summer heat kicks into effect. When I pulled into the bay, I was greeted by clear and concise instructions on exactly what to do.

Seeing as how I only had a credit of four minutes, I quickly got to washing my truck. I was about 2/3 through the entire cycle when the credits expired and I had to revert to a credit card payment. I found the machine to work well, and I could really tell that my truck got the much-needed polish it was waiting for. Did I mention that this is a fraction of the cost of your standard full-service car wash?!

I will still opt for a full-service wash when I want my interior cleaned (I despise of doing that part myself), but will wholeheartedly be back here for the times my vehicle is only in need of an exterior wash."

He put a 9 volt charge into the electric system ( using the onboard outlet ) and saved the settings.  He drove us to a store with the best price. He used his contractor's account. I paid for the battery. Bob even checked the "" birth date"" of the battery ( 12/17 ) After installing the battery, he had me use the electric door key lock and unlock. This resets the computer system settings. I did not lose a single setting. Of course, the very cold temperatures, made the "" check tire air pressure indicator go on.

Automotive,3.0,OR,"Absolutely terrible. Got four new tires for my car. Very nice tires. I wanted to clean my car before I took it in but didn't have the time. I didn't get a chance to wash my car and wheels for a week after the tire installation. I noticed that there was at least one nick of some kind of 3/4 of my wheels. 

Knowing that they were undamaged prior to the service I got, I went to talk to them. I spoke with Ken. He looked at my wheels then said ""I'll have someone come out and fix them"". He then told me he would set up an appointment with me within the next few days. As soon as I left he went and spoke with my uncle, a mechanic for the company, and said he would NOT be fixing the damage on my wheels. 

After not hearing from Ken for another week I went back to Indy Tire to speak with him again. This time he said the damaged wasn't caused by them. After arguing with him for a bit to no avail, he threatened to take the financing off of my tires, a cowardly move. This is after he'd already told me that he would fix the problem. This ""manager"" couldn't even call me to tell me this. 

After yet ANOTHER week, now more than two weeks after I noticed the damage, he offers to split the cost with me. He expected me to pay for damage that they caused. 

This is an absolutely TERRIBLE branch of the Indy Tire company. I don't think they represent Indy Tire the way that it should be. Do not go here. Under any circumstances. 

I went to the Indy Tire in Avon and also the one in Carmel the service was excellent! Great people work here. Ken at 30th and Post is a complete idiot."
Automotive,3.5,OR,"My front brakes were making that horrible, teeth-gritting, scraping sound that I've dubbed, ""roll of thunder, hear my cry,"" and I was off to Chicago in less than 24 hours. So, I Googled auto repairs near where I work in the CWE and hoped for the best. Well, I got the best for sure! I called Midtown right when they opened and asked, ""I know I need at least new front brake pads, if I bring my car in within the hour, will it be ready by 3 p.m.?"" ""Absolutely,"" the man replied. 

When I arrived at Midtown, the man behind the counter--Dave, I think--listened to me and asked me questions and continued to listen. I mean, he could have been a model for quality patient care with the Affordable Care Act!  I usually feel totally disrespected by auto repairs guys, they're all like, ""sweet heart,"" and stuff, and I usually resort to invoking my dad. Dave, however, listened to me and showed respect. 

They offered to drive me to work, which I totally appreciated as well. I chose to walk, since I work only about 5 blocks away, but it was still a great gesture and good to know. Within an hour they called me back, explained everything that needed to be fixed, and 2 hours after that, they were done!

When I arrived, Dave knew immediately who I was and told me right away to give myself about 15% more braking space for the first 20 brakes. He remembered that I was driving to Chicago and told me about how much he loves the Hard Rock Cafe there. He even searched their website and found me a coupon, which covered the sales tax. 

I will definitely return to Midtown Tire & Auto Service, which will be in about 5,000 miles--that's when my rear brake pads are going to need to be replaced."

Automotive,5.0,OR,"I couldn't reiterate this enough in person so I'd present it here. General Transmission has made my experience very pleasant, comforting and great quality service. Their ardent expertise and knowledge on Transmission went beyond my expectations. From basic transmission information, potential / root cause failures to corrective actions; General Transmission has distinguished themselves to be the top of my list. During my visit, they had informed me that my 2011 Toyota Tacoma transmission is out of commission due to lack of transmission fluid (FYI, check your tranny fluid, even if it's located at the bottom of your vehicle). They mentioned it could cost me close to $4000!  Though, I wasn't surprised as I had an idea this is what it would range to, but nevertheless it still would leave a burn in my pocket. Within the timeframe of repairing my truck, they would call and update me on the current status of my vehicle. There best customer service and due diligence to ensure the customer has an alternative transportation was beyond my expectation. Then, the last day to call me prior to picking up my truck was music to my ears. General Transmission revealed after conducting further testing and evaluation, that there was still enough fluid to maintain transmission lubrication and that the transmission can be saved! 
 
This goes to show, though I had no control what was occurring behind the scenes, but integrity and honest work made its way. General Transmission saved me $4000!  What more can I ask. Being in the military for 18 years and having instilled core values, General Transmission truly mirrors their excellence and professionalism throughout. Great credit to the staff, their honest work, and distinctive best customer experience. I would definitely recommend them to my military friends, personal friends and anyone."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"Last year I took my wife's car over to Firestone on Natural Bridge in Bridgeton and bought 4 tires.  When I picked the car up they told me I needed a brake job ASAP!  I told the guy I had to discuss it with my wife, since we had just spent a lot of money on the tires.  The next day I took the car over to Big G to check the brakes.  They said we still had some miles left on the brakes, and didn't charge to check them.  We drove the car for another 11 months before the brakes started squealing.
 
This week we took her 2005 Honda Accord to Big G for the brake job that Firestone tried to sell us almost a year ago.  It was a completely Contact Free experience.  Being in my 70's during this pandemic,  I really appreciate this.  When I dropped the car off I put my key in the drop box on the right side of the building.  I called the office to let them know the car was on their lot and the keys in the drop box.
 
Today when I got the call that the car was ready, I gave the young lady my credit card number over the phone, and asked her if they could put my key and the paper work in my trunk.  She said, ""Sure.""

My wife drove me back to Big G and opened the trunk so I could get the car key and the receipt.  At no point did I come anywhere near any other customers or employees.

I really appreciate the honesty and competence of Big G, and now even more, I appreciate how they made it 100% safe for me to get the work done.

I highly recommend Big G to anyone needing service on their car."

Jason told me he would have the car I wanted for my budget, and I would be there by the end of the day. Jason got me in the car I wanted, and the price was right.

Automotive,1.5,OR,"I wouldn't give a star for the service department but I had to.  Had issues with the washer fluid motor.  It was still under warranty so I took it in to be checked.  My first mistake.  I was to get the car back later that day and I did.  I added washer fluid when I arrived home.  All the fluid did was pour on the driveway.  I took it back.  Apparently, when the technician (as they call themselves now) replaced the fluid motor the line was cut or broken.  I would think the mechanic would acknowledge the fact that the line was damaged and inform someone.  That would be a couple of days for the work to be done.   So they put the wheel well back together and gave me my car to drive.  On the way home the car was making a terrible squeaking and groaning noise from the front suspension.  When I took the truck back for the line I told them of the noise.  They ordered the new strut (nothing wrong with it when I brought the truck in) and had that installed.  
The front desk was fine but the mechanics (technicians) are not worth the aggravation.
I attempted to contact Reedmans with the issue and wanted to speak to someone, but receive zero responses.  This is why now I'm writing this review.  Don't have your car/truck serviced at the Chevy. service.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"Like other reviewers, I would give this family-run shop 10 stars if I could. They are not only the best car shop I've ever dealt with, they are one of the best small businesses I've ever dealt with, period.

My car had a dead battery near their shop. I know nothing about cars...and believe me, this is obvious to anyone within 5 seconds. It would not be hard for a mechanic to take advantage of me. 

I came in and talked to Frank. He took the key from me...and basically handled everything from there. I had to go back to work, but they sent someone to find the car, jumped it, and brought it into their garage. They charged the battery, filled the tires, checked everything over, and told me what was wrong (and right) with the car.

I was planning to sell the car, so they let me keep it on their lot for at least two weeks so they could show it to people who might be looking for a car. Eventually I did sell it. Throughout this process they had multiple legitimate opportunities to bill me -- but they never would. Frank insisted that they hadn't done anything for me, despite the fact that they had really helped me and made my life easier in several ways. In the end I literally had to force a small tip on Frank for all of his help.

For car novices like me, the fear when you take your car to a shop is that you're going to be taken advantage of. The mechanic can say anything, charge you anything, and what can you do? You can't challenge him -- and he knows that. Well, this place could have easily taken advantage of me; but they steadfastly refused to. You can rest assured that they'll tell you the truth and won't do work that isn't necessary. Highest possible recommendation."

Now the bad; the bathrooms are single toilets. I walked in and turned to lock the door when someone tried to jerk the door open. I didn't say anything thinking the locked door said it all. Then I sat down and someone pulled the door again.  I hollered out thinking that anyone with manners would wait. Then as I was washing my hands the door starts rattling again - I yelled back the third time! All the while this same man and woman have been yelling at the young man in the men's room that he needed to unlock the door. I figured they were just drunk jerks. Nope it's one of the servers! Then she doesn't apologize but says I thought you were stuck in there (you have to left up on the door knob) but I think she was just being a jerk. I was shocked. We had a great dinner and are finishing our drinks and talking and enjoying the great weather when she comes over (not our server but the same little jerk from the bathroom) and wants to know when we are leaving because someone is waiting for our table!  The table right beside us was empty but she wanted us to leave?! There were empty tables everywhere!  I wanted to say something to the manager but my husband was tired and just wanted to go home. Since we live half a mile down the street this is a great spot for us and the food is great which is why I gave it three stars but it should have been 5.

Automotive,4.5,CG,"I could not agree more with the people at the front desk. 

The person who helped me was not very friendly. She was very polite, and she was very professional. The only thing I can say about this place is that it's not very close to the mall. I had a very good experience at the store, but the last time I came here was really bad. I was in there about 15 minutes before they closed. 

However, I got there before they closed, and they were very quick. I felt like they were trying to up-sell me on services, but I ended up getting a couple of things done at another car wash. 

They were busy and I was able to get in and out within 15 minutes. 

The only complaint is that I have to give them credit card for the times I've been there. They have no clue what the problem is and I've been able to use a credit card as a payment on my credit card for about 5 times.

I think they are a bit pricey for the service, but I'm very pleased with the work that was done here. I've been here for years.

Automotive,4.5,OR,"My usual trustworthy spot in New Orleans was tied up due to Jazz Fest congestion, so I turned to Yelp for an emergency alternative and found myself at Cacamo's bright and early. My morning began with pleasant conversation, welcoming friendliness, and a reassurance that my problems would be solved. Cacamo's embodies all that there is to love about the service industry in New Orleans, and my morning was spent in as pleasant an environment as being in my own home. 

As early as my parts could be obtained, they were ordered. The repairs happened quickly and at no point did I ever get the feeling that I was burdening someone's day with my emergency. In fact, there was no point of my morning where I wasn't completely aware of what was happening with my repair. I felt 100% completely at ease... and I can only mirror what has already been said in previous reviews.

Once the repair was complete, the owner not only double-checked by retesting my car, but asked me to join him at my car until I had confidence and reassurance that I was truly out of the woods. Then came the bill - I was astonished when I was given a bill a full 1/3 less than my usual spot.

Okay, I'm now a Cacamo Convert. But, I want to add, that in my time hanging out in the lobby, I was witness to a lot of interactions between staff and customer, and my experience wasn't unique. Everyone that came in was treated like a family member. It reminded me of being 16 and owning my first car and my dad helping me to solve every problem I encountered. That may seem extreme - but more than once this morning, I was transported back to my teenage years hovering over an open hood with my dad at my side.

( I know this because I asked her) Because of their competitive price, I elected to go with them & made an appt. She said it would take them 4 days to order the glass in & have it available. When the day came for them to arrive here to replace the glass, nobody called or showed up. When I called the 800 number to inquire as to what was going on, it rang forever with no answer & no company voice mail or way to leave a message! Finally, about 2 hours later, a man called me from a Phoenix Arizona phone number, & said they wouldn't be able to do the job. Not today, not ever. He said they can not find the correct replacement windshield! When I informed him that his company double checked on its availability before I set the appointment, he had no comment. When I informed him that i had quotes from 3 other glass companies, who somehow were able to locate this windshield, he still had no comment. I think they just didn't feel like driving out here, or there wasnt enough profit in the job or something. He seemed VERY evasive on the phone when asked why, and was in an apparent hurry to get off the phone. This ticked me off, as I had already waited 4 days for this appt., only to be cancelled on. This company's customer service is just awful and its employees seem not to know a thing about their business, or even how to run a business in general. I would avoid this company at all costs!"

Automotive,1.5,OR,"Turnersville Mazda was very rude to me.  I'm 26 making $90,000 a year with a credit score of 700 and they told me up until their manager came out that my parents would have to cosign. When I test drove the week before my salesman told me they could do as well as 1.9% on my APR for 60 month financing if I qualified. When I came in to buy they started negotiations with an APR of 3.9% and the same salesman denied he would ever say such a thing!!! I brought a friend who's good at this kind of thing and we talked them down to 1.9% by threatening to walk (So yes, they can do it. Don't take no for an answer). I was there haggling for an excruciating 3.5 hours, and because of that I came away with a decent deal.

The most awful part is that I was hit by another driver 10 days later and my new car was totaled.  I wanted another 2014 Mazda3 because I was unharmed in that serious accident and considered myself very lucky. But I would NEVER deal with Turnersville/Maple Shade again. I got online quotes, and Faulkner Mazda beat their price by $500 and offered me 1.9% APR without argument just a few short weeks later. They couldn't believe I was ever offered anything else. (Plus, I am now a Mazda loyalty customer and got $750 off for that!) I was in and out in under 2 hours and they were ridiculously pleasant to deal with as far as salesman go!  Plus, they mailed me my plates instead of making me come back to pick them up. And they had a bigger ""buyer group"" so they were able to get me the color I really wanted.

I wouldn't waste your time at Turnersville.  Get an online quote from a competing dealership. Save yourself the money, time, and aggravation."

Automotive,4.0,OR,"This is our experience this week. We were AAA members through our company but hadn't renewed (not intentional). Ironically, my husband went on a road trip and the truck transmission failed 4 hours from home. It was in the middle of nowhere. He called AAA and was told to renew, which he did at $188 to receive 200 miles 'free' towing. So he asks for a tow truck and they then tell him he must wait a 48 freaking hour window?! No offer of help. Sooooooo, thank God he was able to get a ride from someone to the nearest town and then back to Tucson. 48 hours later, we order another tow truck and we were passed from customer service rep to another (transferred 4 times) only to be told that he must be with the truck. Was he expected to wait on the side of the road, 4 hours away, for 48 hours?? We offered proof once the truck got back to Tucson and the horrendous manager proceeded to tell him tough luck and cancelled our membership!!! So as he went to pick up a trailer to drive back, AAA calls back and apologizes for their poor customer service and had a truck in route. We actually spoke to the tow company that confirmed this whole thing was completely wrong and they tow cars unattended ALL THE TIME?! So 50 hours later, and paying for the truck to be towed to Mesa by a random shop, AAA sends a truck to bring it from Mesa to Tucson. 50 hours, a lot of tears of frustration, and the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. I feel that although they finally brought it back, the manager should be fired or demoted for their complete lack of knowledge or service and all the reps need training. I'm still wondering how we received so many hours of horrible service."

Very dissatisfied with the customer service we received from Mike at the front desk. First my 81 year old uncle took the car in for a diagnostic scan, reason for scan ,when at a STOP the car would shut off. Mike informed my uncle, that the car needed a few other repairs. Needless to say to the tune of $1,861.81. After 3 days my uncle picked up the car, and the next day the car had the same issue. When he called Mike, he told him if this continues bring in back in 10 days. The car was back in the shop, every day my uncle would call and was told the part isn't in yet. Call back in two days, call back after 2:00PM, this went on for 2 weeks. I got involved to assist my uncle, I called and spoke with Mike on Sunday 8/20/2017, he was rude and told me to call back on Monday. When I called on Monday, he was rude and hung up the phone on me. I decided to go in person with my uncle, Mike said they had been working on the car all day, which was not true. I demanded to see the car, it was in the lot, Mike had someone run out and bring it into the bay. I then spoke with Jonathan, to discover he's the owner's son. The next day we went in and spoke with the owner Jose Fernandez, he refunded $300.00+ after I told him the amount is excessive. He reviewed the account and informed us of the overcharge. I contacted Jose the next day to let him know he charged taxes on the $300+ and we needed a refund. Needless to say we've yet to receive the $25+ and the car is in the same shape.  After numerous attempts contacting corporate to resolve the issue, no one has contacted us."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Let me preface this review by saying I am very disappointed in the customer service I received from the management.  I had a great experience at this dealership, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  

I am a loyal customer for years and I still feel very comfortable with the sales team at this dealership.  I have had many interactions with several different sales managers in the past, but I have not had a good experience.  I have a 2012 Tacoma, and have had to take it in for service, but I am very happy with the service I received.  I went in for a oil change and was told it would take about an hour to complete the oil change.  I told them I was going to go in to pick up my truck, and when I got there, they had the truck waiting for me.  I was told that the oil change would take about an hour and a half.  I asked if I could come back for a ride to the dealership, and they had not even started on my truck.  I asked if I could wait on my truck, and was told no, I would be there in a minute.  I would have to wait.  I was told they would call me to wait.  I was not to wait, and waited in the service, and wait on my vehicle.  I was told that it would be there and there for another hour, no one hour.  in the other people would be there.  and I was waiting.  I was waiting,  I was waiting.  I was told me. "
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Worst car buying experience I have ever been through. My boyfriend and I both bought brand new 2018 Kia Optimas. We each spent several hours at the dealership, over several days, being mostly left in the dark as far as what was being done by the sales/finance managers, behind the scenes, but being promised that everything would be just what we wanted. Then I was told my financing terms would be one thing, but when the final paperwork came in the mail, the terms weren't what they told me they would be would be.
When it came time to pick up the cars, both were promised to be ready by the time we got off of work, but my boyfriend ended up waiting around the dealership another 3 hours for his car to be detailed. My car was delivered to me with a slice in the steering wheel. I was told I'm going to have to miss work in order to bring the vehicle in to have it repaired because Lokey will not offer a loaner car. 
Then after all the paperwork was signed and cars were delivered, it mysteriously took them almost a month to send the payoff check for my boyfriend's trade. He had to provide documentation more than twice because they somehow lost it. In the meantime he was getting notices advising that he was late on his payment. Whenever we called, emailed, or texted to inquire as to what was going on, most went unanswered and unreturned. My boyfriend had to actually drive to the dealership to actually talk to someone about the payoff for his trade and he was told it would be sent within 3-4 days (this is after it had already been over 2 weeks). They actually did not send the check for another 11 days. This is quite possibly the worst customer service we have ever received from a car dealer. We will never purchase cars from Lokey again."
Automotive,2.0,CG,"This dealership used to be a great car dealership, but I will not ever go back. I bought a used car from this dealership. The car was advertised on the lot and was not sold. It was a total scam. I would not recommend this dealership. I had a 2 year old car and it had a major problem and they told me they would take care of it for free. I was there for two weeks and it was still not fixed. They told me they would fix the car but would not pay for it. They told me that they would not do anything. When I went to pick up my car, they told me they had found a broken bolt in my tire. When I questioned the issue, they told me that they were going to fix it, but that they were going to have to fix it. I gave them the car back and was told that they did not find anything wrong. I was not given a written estimate on the car, but was told that it was fixed, so I would be paying for it. When I picked up the car the car, they told me that it was not fixed, but it was not fixed. I was not fixed. They told me it was not fixed. They said they had to check all the tires and told me that it. They didn't need a week before the day before. because they should have to drive the tires were not drive it. but was not drive. I didn't drive it would be fixed."
Automotive,4.5,OR,"After arriving for my appointment, I was told the price would be more than they quoted me the week before. This should've been my sign. I told them they entered the information into their computer system, but they failed to look at the information while I was at the store. After I left, they called and texted me telling me that indeed the quoted price was in the system. I agreed to come back for the agreed upon service. After the service was performed, a large hole was noted in my bumper. I notified the shop of the issue. 
 I arrived at the shop when they opened and was shown a video of how the damage occurred. It was an accident (which happens). Initially the manager said they'd take care of everything, but then he changed his mind stating there was preexisting damage-even though there's no proof of preexisting damage. They did 2 different intake forms for my vehicle, and neither noted any damage on the bumper. My bumper had no damage or holes prior to my arrival-their video evidence supports this. The only thing we have proof of is that the technician damage my bumper, to the point it is in no longer functional and needs to be replaced. They admitted to the damage but refused to replace the bumper due to unproven ""preexisting damage"". What are the odds that a 9 day old car has damage and is then damaged again in the same exact spot and is caught on camera? I bet my odds are better to win the lottery.
Sad thing is, tbey are nice enough guys and did a good jobs on the tint, just be aware that they won't fix damage done at their facility. I discussed the situation at length with the manager. He asked for a 3 days to review the video to prove there was existing damage. I agreed to the time frame but never heard back."

We bought a used car from here and I am extremely disappointed. This dealership is a joke.

When I asked the guy if they could fix it, he said ""we don't do that, we just put the mats back in the car and it was not cleaned"". When we went back to pick it up, the guy said it was not cleaned properly. We had to pay for the service and to have the windshield replaced. This is the worst service I've ever received. We should have went somewhere else. Don't even bother going here. You should be ashamed of yourself. I bought a car from this dealer in November. I was told by the salesman I could not buy a car without the warranty. I was told that the warranty would cover the cost of the repairs. When I got home I discovered that the car was not only covered and I was told by the salesman that it was not covered. I was never signed the papers. I did not and the warranty. I will never get my own a car and I purchased a car. I did not even though the warranty and had a warranty. I had a new car. So now I would never buy a new car with this warranty.

I purchased my first car from them. I had an excellent experience. The process was smooth, and the sales people were courteous and professional. The finance department was a bit of a pain in the butt. The financing department was a bit confusing as I was told it would take about 3-4 days to get the paperwork completed.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"I bought a certified used 2014 Dodge RAM 1500 from Reedman toll in August 2018. I have had it in the service department 3 times since then. The first time was for almost dying due to a lug nut being under torqued and snapping when I was on the highway. After this was fixed I received a check engine light and had it read. Turns out I had an issues with my EVAP sensor. It apparently was covered under my warranty so I had to pay a $100 deductible. The day after I picked it up from the shop the check engine light came back on for the same issue. When I called to set up another appointment I was told they would not be able to look at it for a few weeks. I asked to speak to the manager and left a voicemail for him to call me back. Naturally I NEVER received a call back. Fast forward a few weeks later and I set up my next appointment. I explained what the problem was and they said if it was the same issue it would be no charge to me. 2 hours later I received a call from the person handling my case. They explained that a rodent had ate through my gas tank causing the reading and it was not covered by my warranty. The quoted me $1500 for just the part. I asked if I could call my insurance to take a look at it. They agreed but said my rental would not be covered because it wasn't under my warranty. I picked up the truck a few hours later after having to pay $125 ""diagnostic"". My insurance told me the damage would be covered if I brought it to their certified mechanic. That Mechanic explained I did not have any problem with the gas tank. HOWEVER, My oil pan is almost completely rusted through and I was leaking power steering fluid!"
Automotive,2.0,OR,"I have taken my car to a different Dobbs location since getting my first car as a teen. I've always had good experiences there, so when my car had a flat tire and the Brentwood location was closest, I thought I could trust them as much as I've been able to trust the other location. 

Wrong.

Not only did I have to wait more than two hours (and fair enough, it was the last of the month and I had no appointment as it was an emergency), but they also failed to accurately diagnose and fix the problem. That said, they somehow had time (and the audacity) to look for and talk me into other ""fixes.""

As soon as I paid for the new tire and other ""needed"" repairs and left, my tire pressure light came back on. I pulled back in and asked the employees if that was normal and to please double-check the work. I was told ""don't worry about it; you'll have to drive about 50 miles for the sensor to reset"" in a condescending tone that made it clear how little that guy respected me.

And so off I drove, still trusting these people.

The next day, I drove to work. So far, so good. Then, an hour or so into my workday, security alerted me that I had a flat tire. Again. The same one.

I called the Brentwood Dobbs back and, to their credit, they did pay for towing and fix the tire for free. But it shouldn't have happened. I trusted them to actually bother to look at the wheel and tire (and again, this despite finding the time to identify other alleged problems they could charge me for), and I brought it back as soon as the light came on again.

I am deeply disappointed in the unethical, unprofessional work done at this location. I will never be back, and this fiasco may have cost the Dobbs location I've patronized for 15 years my business."

Automotive,3.5,OR,"(Before my story) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE TRAVELING INTO NASHVILLE!! 

These guys are fantastic. I was driving from Austin to Nashville for a weekend trip. Every time I had to start my car, I had to use a jumper box to jump start the car. When I was about 120 miles out from Nashville, I decided to start calling places to figure out when I could get a new battery or how I should go about fixing my car. I found this place on Yelp (thanks Yelp!) and called in. The owner said that it would cost them a fair amount to do the battery work, but that I could save money by going to O'Reilly AutoParts and just purchasing a new battery there. This was the first of many wonderful interactions that I had with the staff of Precision Auto-Tune. Once I was at O'Reilly's, they tested my battery and said that my alternator was broken! $190+ later, I had a new alternator and was bound for nashville and somewhat dangerously since O'Reily Autoparts INSISTED that I got the repair done nearby rather than making the drive. However, I arrived safely to Nashville, where I stared to get a little suspicious of O'Reily's. The next day, I drove my car to Precision Auto-Tune, where after a small check up they told me that, after all, my battery was the thing that was not working! They charged me the minimum they could (instead of charging me almost double that!) and sent me on my way back to O'Reilys to get a new battery. The short of it is this: Even though I'm a college student from out of town, these folks at Precision Auto Tune did their very best to make sure I could figure out my problem within my financial restraints. It's sad that I don't live in Nashville or I would make this my GO TO auto repair shop. Kudos and bless everyone that works here."

Automotive,3.0,OR,"Piss poor salesmen and service.

Went here for an MDX because we bought a TL from Piazza in Ardmore and they were awesome. Lets get started. 

We took a test drive and we literally asked the ""salesman"" about a dozen questions. He answered maybe one of them. The response for the others were ""I'm not really sure"". Even after we bought the car he was ""showing"" us the features - that he didn't even know how to use. It was SO bad, we had to tell him to stop talking because we would just figure it out for ourselves and that it basically like ALL THE OTHER ACURAS. Its literally like it was his first day as a car salesman, but hes been one for like 35 years.

So one of the reasons we bought it from here is because I figured I could take the car to the Ardmore location because its the same owner and is less than 10 minutes from my work. No dice. Apparently, they're independent of each other and basically have to deal with incompetent people from West Chester now.

One of the keys didn't work so he said just bring it in. When I did, he said he had to order the parts for it. So I drove there for NOTHING cause of an incompetent lazy salesman. A week goes by and I call to see whats up - there's NO record of the order ever going through. Awesome.

After finally getting pissed off enough, I call and explain all the shitty stuff we've been going through and then he says ""I'm new, I'll have the used car sales manager call you"". Another week goes by, no call.

Your dealership is crap! Your salesmen are inexperienced/incompetent, your service department is horrible and your car sales managers don't seem to care about feedback .I will NEVER buy another car from here again.

FYI - it took a bad Yelp review to get a response out of someone from the dealership."

But I was feeling a little cheap today and I always get coupons from Calverts so I thought I would give them a try for the $14.99 oil change special. I found the guy at the counter to be very helpful and friendly. I did bring my dog with me and I started to tie her up outside and then I sat inside and the guy told me I can bring my dog in with me so I thought that was cool. My only complaint about my experience was the amount of wait time, it took 2 hours and 15 minutes total from me arriving and leaving, which I find extremely long for an oil change. So I sat there for about an hour and 15 minutes and my car was still in the same spot that I parked it, then it took them about an hour to do the actual oil change. I don't know if that's because of the amount of staff that they had in the shop or if it's just because they do more than just oil changes, they do all types of services and repairs and some of those things take longer and I do believe they go on a first-come first-serve basis. I feel like maybe if they had one person who was there just to do oil changes to get those people in and out quicker might be helpful. I believe the oil change went good I've heard mixed reviews of people who leave and their check engine light might be on or they get harassed with a long list of all these things that's going on with their car I didn't experience none of that so that's a plus. Overall with tax I paid $20.17 and I would consider returning there for my future oil change haven't decided yet."
Automotive,3.0,OR,"I will never buy another Nissan, I am so disappointed. I bought a brand new Sentra not even 6 months after owning this vehicle I had to take it in for repairs for what I am certain was a Transmission, well they said there was nothing wrong. Few weeks after that same issue so I took it in again and they said oh it's the Mass Air Flow Sensor. Well a month after that same problem, take it in again and they say oh it's only an Oxygen Sensor I believe they said and replaced it. Well guess what? Month later I am driving with my wife and 2 young children ages 11 & 6 on a very busy 4 lane highway suddenly same exact issue car will not accelerate above 35 MPH and then stalls out in the middle of the highway causing my family to literally miss getting rear ended by a Semi by maybe a foot, again I was nearly certain it's the Transmission have it towed there and again they say no, this time it's the Throttle Body. I have wrote corporate, my local dealer ship and all they keep saying is the Warranty is now up, however, if the problem persist they will cover it. I am literally petrified to put my family back in this  lemon and now it literally sits in my driveway reminding me of what a poor brand is. Bought the vehicle brand new and for 2 years it's been in the shop half a dozen times or more for the same issue that they keep saying is something else when I am certain it is the transmission, so I am stuck with a lemon and the payments on a lemon that myself nor my wife are comfortable driving for fear of the next close call with a semi becoming reality thanks Nissan for refusing to admit it's the Transmission and replacing every part in the car but the transmission."
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I will share two polar opposite experiences I've had at this location.

1. The shuttle driver was not very friendly. The driver took my car out of the garage and left it with the shuttle. It was a long wait for the driver. I had to call the driver to ask if he could come pick me up. I had to call the driver to come pick me up. He didn't call me back. I called the driver again and told him I had to drive it to the garage. The driver told me he would pick me up. I waited for the driver and he told me he would pick me up. I went back to my car and waited for the driver. I arrived at the airport to pick up my car and the driver was not there. He was in a hurry to pick me up from my car. I was told he would call me back. I waited and waited again. Finally got my car. I was told by the driver that he would call me back. I had to wait another half hour for the driver to pick me up. I called the driver again, he told me he was working for another 30 minutes and he was working on my car. He never told me he was picking me up. I would pick me up the driver. He was on the driver. I called and I asked him. I waited another driver. He said he was not there. I told him. He asked if I should be there. He was there. He was sitting at the driver. I was waiting for my car and he was at the driver and he was on the driver. I told me."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"I paid for the full service wash and the inside was not vacuumed, the floor mats were still dirty and the floor mats had streaks. The windows were not vacuumed, and the tires were not vacuumed. I will never use this car wash again. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was in and out in under an hour and they did a great job. They even cleaned my car! I highly recommend this place. I was looking for a new car for my daughter. I was looking for a new car, but unfortunately my daughter was going to be in a car accident, and we ended up with a beautiful Honda Accord. I had a wonderful experience with Mark and the team at Sloane Honda. I had a great experience with them and would recommend them to anyone looking for a new car. I'm happy to say that we are not the only Honda dealer in the area, and I will recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new Honda. The dealership is clean, professional, and very helpful. I would highly recommend Sloane Honda of Sloane Honda of Sloane Honda for your next Honda car purchase!I needed a new headlight bulb on my car, and a little old guy at the dealership. It was super busy. I had to work on the phone. I called them. They were able to get my appointment. When I told them to give me a quote me a quote, he would be there in 1 hour. I wanted to have a loaner the bulb

Automotive,2.0,OR,"I normally never post reviews of services but felt my experience with Wax werks today might save others from being inconvenienced, at best, or not served at all. I called yesterday to schedule an appointment to have the interior of my car detailed for the first time. I asked approximately how long it might take and was told two hours since they had a couple of other cars they were working on. That was fine with me. I dropped off my car at 11:30 am today and reconfirmed with the manager that it would take two hours- or closer to 2:00 pm and that they would call me. After not hearing anything from them by 2:30, I called and first was told that the technician ""was gone for about 10 minutes."" I did receive a return call and was informed that they had ""just pulled my car in and it would be 4:00 before it was done.""  This was unacceptable to me and I instructed them to pull my car back out and I was on my way to retrieve it. After two back and forth trips, I arrived to see that my car was still sitting in the same parking spot where I had left it that morning and clearly had not been touched, let alone moved. The manager informed me that ""we tell people to leave their cars all day"" to which I stated,""You were the one who told me, in person, this morning, that my car would be done by 2 pm.""  I also was not informed to leave my car all day when I scheduled the appointment the previous day. After a couple of tepid ""sorry about that""s and no sense that this business cared one hoot whether or not I left a satisfied customer or would potentially return one day for additional services, I left.  I will chalk this up to a lesson on how not to run a business and move on."
Automotive,2.5,OR,"I drove 45 minutes to this dealership yesterday since they had the specific Jeep Wrangler I was looking for. I test drove it and loved it! I then came inside and worked with Richard Levine to negotiate a lease payment. I had been offered a good deal by a dealership that was further away, so I came to see if they could give me a better one, hoping to avoid the long drive. Well, after probably an hour or so of negotiating, Richard kept coming back with offers lower than his previous, but still not better than the other dealer. Finally he offered to match the deal, but Richards car didnt have the LED lights/fog lights option, which the other dealerships car did. When I asked if he could do better, he became infuriated. I simply stated it's okay if you can't but why would I lease the car for the same price with less options? When I pointed this out he acted as if I was being completely ridiculous for not buying his car at the same price as the other one over one silly option. In the end, I thanked him for his time and went to shake his hand, but he just shook his head at me, repeatedly said ""goodluck"" in an rude sarcastic tone, stormed off, and left me sitting at his desk. In the end, I called the other dealership and he made me an even better offer than the one Richard could barely match! Nevertheless, I drove my brand new wrangler home today and I am in love! If you are looking for an exceptional experience buying a car with sales reps who are kind honest respectful patient and well informed, steer clear of this place and check out Savage 61 Chrysler Dodge Jeep and Ram in Reading, PA. TOTALLY worth the trip!! The sales manager Sean is absolutely incredible(and he gave me a great deal!!) and Louis is also extremely kind!!! Happy car shopping:)"
Automotive,4.0,CG,"Please don't waste your time here. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the owner is a jerk. 

I've been here twice and both times it was pretty bad. They had no clue where to find a rental car. I called to check on how long it would take to get my car to the shop. They told me it would take about 30-45 minutes. When I came in to pick it up they told me it would take 30-45 minutes. I waited another 30-45 minutes. I finally got my car back, and it was still sitting in the parking lot. I asked them to check it out. They said it would take another 45 minutes. I told them I was at work and would be picking it up. They said it would take another 20-45 minutes. I asked the owner for a receipt. He said he would check it out. I said ""oh I didn't get a receipt."" He said that he would call me back. I never heard from him.

I called back another mechanic and he said he had called me back, and told me he was working on my car and I was leaving for the day. He said he would call me back. He said he would call me back and I told him to check on the next day. He said he never called me.


I left a message and he would call me back. I never did. So he never called me back and he said he had to check my car was on the next day. I didn't call him. The day. I left the following up and I then again"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"First of all, I did not end up buying a Mazda -- so this is not a review of any car. But I wanted to write a review for this dealership, because even though I selected a different vehicle for purchase, I had a very good experience with the Ray Skillman team.

The friendly chief sales guy came out to greet me, and I was assigned to one of the sales and leasing consultants, named Drew. Drew and I reviewed some things about the car for which I'd requested a test drive, and then we went out for a spin.

Drew did not talk down to me as a woman buying a car, or ask me what color I wanted, or treat me like anything but a grown human looking to spend a significant sum of money on a piece of technology. I also didn't get any hard sales push, as that is definitely a turn-off to me; he seemed to let me set the pace of discussion, while still anticipating some questions without being pushy. We had a comfortable and friendly drive; I (again, a woman shopping alone) didn't feel awkward or uncomfortable at all. I was grateful for his expertise on their line of vehicles, and his interest in helping me find the right car for me, rather than just pushing something that he wanted to sell me. Drew also surprised me with a piece of good advice -- if test-driving multiple cars, try to do so within a short amount of time, so you have the most fresh memories by which to compare them. I thought that advice showed an understanding of the broad shopping experience many (most?) car buyers need to undertake, in order to make sure this large expenditure produces the best result.

I would recommend the Ray Skillman Mazda West dealership as a place to include in your vehicle search. Didn't try the cookies, which seem to be popular in other reviews here -- I'm sure they're delicious! :)"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Pros:  great product, great customer service, and very friendly people.  Highly recommend!Very rude. Went in for a simple oil change.  The guy who checked me in was rude and condescending.  It was clear I was being taken advantage of and charged for something I didn't need.  I ended up going to a different place and the guy who checked me in was very nice.  This place is a rip off and they will rip you off.I had a great experience with this company. I was looking for a used car and ended up with a beautiful new one. I was greeted by a salesman named Aamco. He was great. He took the time to explain everything and was very knowledgeable about the car. He was patient with me and helped me choose what was best for me. I definitely recommend this dealership.I have never had such a pleasant experience at a car dealership. I was greeted by my salesman, Mark. He was very patient and thorough with me and made me feel comfortable. He was very friendly and respectful of my needs and would not pressure me into buying a car. I felt that I was not only buying a car. I never felt pressured to purchase. I was offered a car. Mark made the decision I did not to buy it. He made me feel comfortable with Mark made me feel comfortable with my decision to buy it. I didn't feel comfortable with him. I was a decision. He also.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"Wow Wow Wow!

That's all I can say about Enterprise Car Sales on Dunn road.  We got referred to Enterprise because we were turned down for a loan at a local credit union.  We were contacted by a senior sales consultant named Stanico Church.  He asked us if we were interested in buying a car and if so he would be more than happy to help us find what we were looking for.  I was very leary because of all I had read and heard regarding car salesmen and their ruthless tactics when it comes to trying to ""get the sale"", but we were so surprised upon actually meeting him how different he and Enterprise car sales actually were.  What's great about Enterprise car sales is their cars are priced fairly and under fair market value by a decent amount.  They also offer no haggle pricing meaning there is no need to go in and negotiate the price; it's fair, and you have full access to the Carfax report to see if maintenance has been recorded.  Nico brought out a couple of cars and it wasn't hard to find exactly what we wanted, a 2018 Kia Sportage.  It didn't take long at all to get financed, and at an APR that we were happy with.  Next, we went to sign the paperwork with Jeremy Hearn, the finance manager.  Jeremy was also great.  He was extremely funny and made us feel at ease to the end part of the process.  There were two other sales consultants we had the pleasure of meeting and dealing with briefly by the names of Terrance Cosby and James Sachar; they were also very kind, cordial and easy to talk to.  Overall we had an A+ experience at Enterprise Car Sales at 623 Dunn Road. We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to buy a great car at a great price with a great experience!"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Avoid this dealership! We got fed completely wrong information from everyone there. We went to look at a potential new car, and got swindled from everyone. The first SALESMAN took our info, including social security numbers and walked away. 30 minutes later we find out he took someone else on a test drive without even telling us as we were sitting there struggling to keep out 2 year old occupied. There were 10+ other salesman around and NOBODY bothered to help us. Finally, my husband demanded our info back and another salesman decided to help us. We told him we had to leave but he said he would call us with info on a new vehicle. After numerous phone calls back and forth they found a vehicle in our price range that they had to order from another location. He told us the offer would only be good that day so we had to put our 2 year old back in the car at 9:30pm and drive back to Tampa from St. Pete. Once we got there, we were told that the car was just sold but they could get us a different color. Okay, whatever. That's fine. So we fill out all of the paperwork for the vehicle. The lease and everything. Leave and the next morning continue calling the dealership to tell them there was an error with the vehicle description on the lease. Well, hours later we hear back from them and they tell us that the new car we leased was sold after we signed the paper work. WHAT?! Then decided to tell us that there were more fees to be paid that were never discussed with the financial department. Management didn't attempt to help resolve the issue all of the employees screwed up!? What kind of management is that? 

I'm writing this long review because cars are EXPENSIVE. Do not let these salesman work you for your money. We are taking our business to another local VW dealership."

I was recommended to them by my brother, who has taken his cars to John Kennedy for years. I have been a loyal customer for many years and I have no issue recommending them to anyone in the area. They have always been honest and upfront with me about what is going on with my car, and they have always been fair with their pricing. 

They also offer shuttle service so you can take your car to and pick you up when you arrive. The service is a couple of times are a little slow because they have to do not have time to do it. They also. 






If you don't leave your car and you have a loaner or even if you don't have a ride to leave your car, they'll call them with a car, they'll be there for 3 hours or leave your car for a couple of hours and they won't pick you

Automotive,2.5,OR,"THEIVES & LIARS! I was due for my 60,000 mi service. I received a flyer in the mail to remind me of it as well as offering me a coupon for that service. I went on to the website to schedule my service and was given a price on what a 60,000 mi service costs. When I got to the service area, I was greeted very quickly and was happy so far. The service supervisor helping with my service, Gary Piccininni, was getting me all checked in and then he tells me the price for the service would be way higher than what the website told me. (Now, anytime I've ever gotten a repair on a vehicle in my life, I never took the quoted price as their word. But when you're talking about a standard service the price should always be the same). I tried to kindly let him know what the website had quoted me and he quickly became annoyed. He asked me if I had a print out (which I didn't think I would need one, so no I did not) and complained that he has no idea where they get the prices from on the website. He matched the price from the website but did not do so happily. Once my service was completed I tried handing the cashier the coupon that was sent to me, from them, and she informs me that I need to give it to the guy that checked me in. I did as such and his contempt and annoyance grew. He treated me as though I was doing something to him and a terrible customer. As if I should not have expected the price provided on THEIR website and that I should also not expect to get the discount that THEY sent me for that service!

Then the cherry on top, the nice reusable (NOT disposable) air filter I went into the shop with was stolen from my car and replaced with a cheap disposable one!!"

I had an issue with my tire and went to get it fixed. I went in and they told me that I needed to have it fixed right away. I went back in, and they said they could not fix it. I told them that I would like to have it fixed, but they would not honor the warranty on the tires. I would have to wait to get it fixed right away. They said I would need to go to a different place, which is far away from my house. They said they could not do it, but that I would have to pay for it. I went to a different tire shop and they said that the tire was bad, but they could fix it. I took it to another shop, and they said it was the same tire, and the same tire was not the same tire, which was the same. They told me it was the same, but it was the same tire, but I asked me to get the same tire and that I asked them to put it on it. They said they put air pressure sensor on the sensor. They said they had to check the sensor on and it. They charged me to see the sensor on. I asked me. They said I needed to be a sensor. I wanted to check it would be replaced the sensor."

Automotive,3.0,OR,"I would've given negative stars to this place! AAA called this company to tow my car after it broke down on a highway, and AAA said they would tow my car to 'main line collision' body shop. After a few days of not being able to hear back anything, I called mainline collision and they said they never had my car there and they had me called 'tommy's towing'. Turned out they had my car stored in their lot and the guy on phone said I'd have to pay more than $700 for less than a week of storage. I told AAA and them it was never my intention to store my car there, but they said Tommy's towing and main line collision have the same address, so I'll be responsible for the expense; also it's cash only. Whenever I called Tommy's towing, the guy was extremely rude and impatient, and said I had to go in person to pay in cash before I can take my car. So I called my own tow guy and went up there. There was no one in the towing office, so I had to call and wait. Finally my tow guy came also, but my car was still blocked by other cars, so I called the same number again as asked if someone could come move the other cars. Then this same rude guy just yelled at me and even say 'don't waste my fucking time, just fucking pay in cash first'. It was extremely unbelievable and obnoxious. Also I found out from one worker here, one day of storage is only $25, and my car was there for only 10 days, so it's $250 not $700!!!! And now he still hasn't sent anyone to move the cars that are blocking my car, and I'm waiting under the sun with no one to assist me. This is completely unbelievable, I would NEVER recommend anyone to use their service.  I don't understand why AAA would be using them."
Automotive,5.0,OR,"As we were new to the area, we needed to find a good honest mechanic.  In various places I've lived, I've always had the best luck with a small shop where you get to know the mechanic and they become familiar with your car through repeated work on it.

My wife's car wouldn't start and the battery was brand new, so based on a few favorable online reviews, it was towed to Tampa Bay Auto Care.  Tim determined quickly it was a very minor problem (loose wiring connection) and only charged my wife for a half hour labor.  He could have easily told us it was a much bigger job and charged us hundreds of dollars for it.  I was so impressed, I booked a tire rotation and oil change a couple days later.

I noticed Tim used a torque wrench to finish the tightening of my tire lug nuts.  I've never seen a mechanic properly torque your lug nuts, very important!

Not only did Tim do a great job with the rotation and oil change, he identified an oil leak near the timing chain cover on the underside of my almost-new car and helped me document it so I could get the dealer to repair it (still under warranty).  I'd only been going to the dealer previously for service, and the dealer probably missed this leak on earlier oil changes based on the amount of oil on the cover on the bottom of the car.   So much for using the dealer while under warranty!  I have more trust now in Tim.

The shop is spotless.  Tim himself is clean, polite, friendly and organized.  You get an electronic invitation for an appointment to your email address.  There is a small air conditioned waiting room, which is also spotless.  

Tim's only been in business at this location for few months, but I am very impressed and want to get the word out to help his business thrive."

Automotive,3.5,OR,"Wrong part put in my car. Resulting in 2. 5mths later the entire axle and car seizing up. No one within the shop or on the corporate cell phone, which their manager Cody gave, willing to address this, in the entirety of the wrong done to me and overcharging for WRONG parts and labor. The 'corporate' guy, Robert, only on a cell phone refused to give me a landline number for his corporate office and denied they had insurance for when they're dodgy mechanics pulled something like this! Before my car seized up, I went back on 4 separate occasions and was blown off. I called countless times. I gave them every opportunity to observe their wrong part in my car and they did nothing, except send me and my child out in a very dangerous vehicle having wrong parts mounted to it! And eventually completely seizing up! Never go to these guys or anyone else associated with their franchise. The length they are willing to go to and lie about service and parts is painful. Just save yourself the trouble. They have used car salesmen mentality, jack the price up at least 3 times, convince you it a bargain, then give you the wrong part and end up endangering you and your child's life. Actually, they give used car salesmen a bad rep, so my apologies to those guys for the comparison there. Update: The dealership has confirmed that manual ONLY axles are to be fitted to my car, which ANY mechanic could've easily looked up by my cars year number. They also were semi horrified your franchise isn't  looking up simple details, overcharging, and jeopardizing ppls lives! How many other ppl have you done this to?!? You guys messed up, so if whoever with BridgeStone would like to make this right, you have my email and telephone contact details.

Automotive,3.5,OR,"""Please for the love of god...someone save me from this waiting room"". 

There are many things to love about Big O Tires. From the friendly staff to the quick service to the clean facilities. I know I'm probably getting a little bit swindled, going to a corporate auto shop and all. But I'm blissfully ignorant about most of that. I'm willing to overlook it all for the sake of convenience and friendliness and really, quality. I've never had a problem with any of the work Big O has done on my car. Never had a problem with them at all. 

However, I DID have a problem with the guy sitting in the waiting room with me. Not that he was obnoxious or loud or commanding attention or anything...it's that he was all those things, old enough to be my dad, AND trying to flirt with me. Me. With earbuds on and a clearly disinterested look of ""hey I'm in a relationship, buddy"". That's a look, right? Trust me, it's a look. 

Now, I know Big O does quick work. I've known it for a long time. It's part of why I go there. But I swear to all that is holy, that was THE LONGEST OIL CHANGE. Seconds ticked by with all the speediness of a tortoise in a tar pit. In that time, I learned that Mr. Waiting Room Flirty Guy moonlights as an auctioneer and he makes ""really good money"" and he loves motorcycles especially the big ones that let a ""little lady sit behind you"". *gag* Also, he's good friends with some local car dealers. So, you know, he's kind of a big deal. 

Luckily, after what seemed like a full rotation of the sun, I was able to leave. The words ""my boyfriend"" had left my lips as many times as they could, not that that did anything. I'll keep coming back to Big O. But I""ll do my waiting at the Starbucks across the street. That waiting room is a Big NO."
Automotive,5.0,CG,"My Jetta has been a nightmare. The dealership has been dishonest, and they have ruined my vehicle. I had an appointment to get a quote and then the manager told me it would take two weeks to get it done. I waited 3 weeks for them to come to my house and give me an estimate. I ended up going to another dealer and got the same exact quote from another dealer. I was shocked. When I went to pick up my car they told me that I had to drive it to the dealer for a repair. I was already told that they would have to order the part and it would take a week or so. I got it back and my car was ready for pick up. I have never had a problem at any of these other dealerships. I would recommend this place to anyone!I had the best experience at this dealership. My salesman was very knowledgeable and took the time to make the experience a pleasant one. I would highly recommend them.I just bought a new 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee and had a great experience. I needed to get a headlight replaced and needed a headlight replaced, and was quoted a price of $800. The work. I called ahead and the price was $1200. I dropped the price, he said I did not much less than I said no work, got my job and said well I would have a price and it would be a $500 and I said I would be a co sign and a great deal. I should have the price. I would be done with $200. I agreed to pick it would be at $500 and he said $200 for the price. I said and got the total and he"
Automotive,2.5,OR,"Such a lack of professionalism and courtesy. 

I lost a key fob.  I purchased a replacement Hyundai key fob on-line ($50 - cheaper that the dealership cost) and initially scheduled an appointment at Fred Beans in Langhorne, PA last week where I purchased my car and had it serviced over the years (mainly when it was McCafferty).  The Hyundai rep Joe M. was extremely rude and told me that because I did not purchase the fob from them, I am probably wasting their time and my money even though Joe M. even showed the fob I purchased to a mechanic who nodded that they could do it.  I was informed it would cost me $100 regardless if it worked or not, and around $200 when I asked what it would cost if I bought a fob from them to program.  He then became annoyed that I was going to wait for my car instead of just dropping it off because he didn't know when it would be done because they were busy!  Like I said, I had an appointment, so...Anyway, I ended up walking out because he stormed away after I ""failed"" to fill out the customer form upon entry because Joe M. took all my info upon arrival and I didn't realize it was still necessary, and at that point, there was no way I was giving them any business with that attitude!  

Fast forward a week, I had an appointment for today with Faulkner Hyundai of Philadelphia to program the same key fob I purchased.  They programmed it for the set fee of $50, not $100, and I was out of there in less than 20 minutes.  No nasty attitude or grief because I did not purchase the fob from them.  Very polite and professional.  I will definitely go  to Faulkner Hyundai for all my car service needs and purchases!  

The quality of service really deteriorated when it switched from McCafferty to Fred Beans!"
Automotive,2.5,CG,"I want to tell you that I am very pleased with the service I received from the mechanic and the owner. I had a bad experience with the dealership, and I had a very positive experience with the service department. I spoke with a very nice gentleman named Dan who was very friendly and seemed to genuinely care about my situation and concerns. I had a very positive experience with the service department. I was very pleased with the service department and the experience overall. I will definitely be back for service on my car.My experience with this shop was really great. I was referred to them by a friend and it was a pleasure to have them take a look at my car. It took about an hour and a half and they were able to fix my problem for free. They were also very helpful and very knowledgeable about the work they did. I highly recommend this shop.I've been coming here for years.  I've taken my cars here for service and repairs, and they've always been very professional and fair with their pricing.  They offer a variety of services such as window tinting, window tinting, windshield repair, and window tinting, and window cleaning, and other services.  I've never felt pressured to buy a car wash it. 





I've recommended them to anyone who needs an honest service my cars.I bought a car from here, and will go there.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"Extremely, extremely lazy workers. I had a terrible experience getting my car washed at this place. It all began upon me entering the wash. I ordered a full-service wash, which includes vacuuming. And they did an absolutely horrible job vacuuming my car, and decided to do it really quickly. I was extremely surprised by the terrible job that they did, so instead of asking them to redo it because I didn't want to seem like a ""pain of a customer"", I took matters into my own hands and started to vacuum the vehicle myself. upon vacuuming the second row, I started to vacuum my third row. That I hear an employee go ""well that's gonna cost you another three dollars"" I looked at him in total surprise, and replied ""OK"" he persisted to ask me for my ticket so he could check off that I need to be charged an additional three dollars because I vacuumed my own third row by myself. Upon the car exiting the wash, it was ready to be dried and cleaned off by a hand towel. I politely asked for the wheels to be cleaned thoroughly because there was still dirt on them. After they were clean, I noticed some more dirt and I asked for one of the representatives kindly to clean the dirt off one of my wheels. Upon me asking, one of the managers goes ""that is the fourth time we are cleaning that wheel"", when in actuality it was only the second time I asked. They are extremely rude and lazy. They expect to get paid for a job that's not 100% complete. Do yourself a favor and go to Car Wash USA if you are looking for a true car wash. I am not coming back here unless ownership or management changes at this facility. They need to get their head straight if they're looking to sell good car washes. As of right now it's just a ""fly-by"" operation. Serious changes with the cleaning staff have to be made."
Automotive,4.0,CG,"The service department at Santa Barbara AutoNation Honda is amazing.  We had a very pleasant experience.  The service department is the most pleasant and efficient car dealership we have ever been to.  They are friendly and efficient.  We came in for an oil change and they had us in and out in about 20 minutes.  We are very happy with our experience at Santa Barbara Honda.We just bought a new Ford F-150 and they did a great job. The salesman was very professional and friendly. We were very happy with the vehicle and the service. The only thing that we had to ask them to do was give us a ride home and pick us up. We had a good experience with this dealership and would recommend to anyone looking for a Ford.I've been a customer for many years and have never been disappointed. I have been going to this Jiffy Lube for years. They have always done a great job and have always been honest about the prices. They have always been fair on the pricing, but have been honest with me. I don't know much about cars, but they are very honest and will tell me what my options and I can't take advantage of that. They are not to get a car from them. I trust. I don't waste time or will go to another mechanic.This is a lot of money.

Automotive,5.0,OR,"Early on weekday mornings, you'll find the guys at Jack's counseling distraught and sometimes grieving car owners.  Often there is a queue three or four deep, and I've listened as each takes a turn on the bar stool at the counter, and shares his or her sad story of auto misfortune.   No matter how hot the weather or busy the schedule, and no matter how impatient the customer with the process of garage triage, he or she gets a listening ear, and a careful explanation of potential problems and options for treatment.
   During the past week, I've visited three times. Lou got my son's Grand Prix running after a tow for an electrical failure.  Todd fixed up my Trailblazer with a new idler pulley assembly and serpentine belt.  I also stopped by to see Steve and Lou for advice on an emissions repair and inspection.  I've been happy not only with the quality of work, but also the price: upcharge on parts seems modest, and labor charges never seem overbooked.  If a part is going to be expensive, they will let you know; if a job will be particularly time-intensive, they will explain why. 
   My first trip to Jack's was for an electrical problem.  A previous trip to the dealer had resulted in a $150 partial fix, and recommendation of an expensive new gauge cluster.  One hour at Jack's, and the short was tracked down and repaired for one hour labor.  It was just a wire pulled free of its contact point in a long harness. That was eight years ago, and I've been going back ever since.  
   Jack was the original owner, and moved the business a short distance to N. Main from its former location actually on the old Route 66 in Edwardsville.  Steve bought the place a few years ago, and Lou is his master mechanic right hand man. These guys are smart: they make cars GO!"
Automotive,3.5,CG,"Mixed feelings on this place.

A few weeks ago I took my car in for an oil change and the guy who changed the oil didn't even charge me for the oil change.

I was so happy I found this place. I will be coming back. I will be back.I would give a zero if I could.  I went in to get a simple tire repair and they told me my tire had to be replaced.  They told me I needed a new tire and that they could do it for $75.  I walked out of there and got a new tire.  When I got there the next day, they told me that the tire had a nail in it, but I should have told them I was going to get new tires for $50.  I was so angry that I went back to get my car and was told that they could fix it for $20.  I went back to the store and they told me that the nail was not in the tire and that the tire was actually in the tire.  They didn't tell me to change it for $75.  When I told them that I would have them to check the tire for free.  because it was in the tire and they never did, they said they did not do not check.  and they asked me if I could check it and I said I bought the tire.  They said I had a used the tire that.  I should have to check the tire and they would not check it for free.  before I said that they checked it.  I checked the tire and told them and told me to give me.  and didn't be happy"
Automotive,2.0,CG,"If you intend to patronize this dealership, go elsewhere. I will not recommend buying a car from here. If you want to get your car serviced, you're in a bind. We bought a used car from here and I am very pleased. I brought my car here after having a flat tire. They fixed it within 30 minutes. They did a great job and they were extremely friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend them. Great experience. I came in to get a tire patched and they were able to get me in immediately. I will definitely be back. They got me in and out in under an hour. Thanks so much!Horrible experience. We bought a 2019 Honda Pilot from them and it was a nightmare. We went in to look at a specific vehicle and the salesman was very rude and unprofessional. He tried to sell us a different vehicle but we wouldn't go any further. We were told the vehicle had a service recall. We went to another dealership and they said that the recall was covered. We went to another Honda dealership to see if the service advisor was able to help us. They told us that they would not only cover the recall. We were told us that the recall and they would have a recall on the recall which dealership. We are not covered. We will go in the recall and we would be reimbursed. We bought the recall. We were told us we bought a car and that the recall which they had to do not cover the recall and they said it would be reimbursed us to come in full refund.

Automotive,4.0,OR,"Probably the worst experience with a mechanic that i've ever had. I went to Coachman because my usual mechanic was backed up 3 weeks. I needed a simple brake job done. Replace brake pads and rotors cut. I provided the mechanic with the pads. I was told my brake caliper was broken so I had to pay $200 to fix it on my Lexus. Didn't mind. I was also given a hard time about having my rotors cut. But after talking to the actual mechanic and not Frank I was able to just have them cut. My bill was $406. Went on my way and that was it. About a day later or so I started hearing a serious vibration in my right front tire. I took it back after about a week and they put my car up on the lift and started to take my tires off and in doing so started snapping off my lug nuts. 6 in total. So i had to pay to replace the lug bolts on my hub. Still annoyed but it was nothing too serious so I paid it and left. The next day a Check VSC light came on in my car. I was feeling extremely aggravated so I took my car to my usual mechanic and paid an $80 diagnostic fee. My mechanic found that Coachman put my left hub on the right side and my right on the left. This was going to require about $250 in labor to switch them back. I called Coachman and calmly told them what the issue was. This is when I was screamed at by FRANK that ""HE WAS DONE WITH ME, HE WASN'T FIXING IT...etc etc""  I honestly couldn't believe how this company was treating a paying customer. I had given them almost $500 and went in for a simple brake job. Now I know why people stick with one mechanic and NEVER use another one. I'm not one to write reviews about companies but felt obligated to after this terrible experience."
Automotive,2.0,OR,"UPDATE: I was contacted regarding this review and was assured this matter would get resolved. In the end I was told the same story and that they could not falsify paperwork. All I know is that my car needed a oil change and a transmission flush the day after I purchased it. They refuse to reimburse me for my costs because the person who promised me this is not employed by Go Dodge anymore. Yet they WERE ABLE to contact him and confirm that this was promised to me. I feel extremely lied to and the stories keep changing. This is quite possibly the worst customer service I have ever received. 


I would highly recommend not purchasing a vehicle from here. Upon myself purchasing one, the next day my vehicle was lagging and not running properly. I stopped by jiffy lube to see what was going on as it seemed it was about to break down. I was told they had not done the transmission fluid or the oil change and they showed me how dirty the stick was and that it needed to be done or the car wasn't going to be running for very long! I was very upset about this as I had just bought the car yesterday. I called south town Chrysler aka go dodge... they said sorry it wasn't done, and to proceed with jiffy lubes services and go dodge would write us a cheque for the cost. It has now been 5 months and they have failed to reimburse us for the cost. It was 411 dollars for us to get the car on the road. The worst part about this is how much this car dealership has lied to us, even going as far as making up paperwork that said these services were done 2 weeks prior to us purchasing the vehicle! Which makes no sense as it literally was about to break down when we bought it. Please save yourself the headache and do not shop here unless you want the same experience."
Automotive,2.0,CG,Service department is a joke! We have been dealing with these people for years and have never been treated so poorly by them. The people are rude and they have no customer service skills. We were told we had to call in to schedule a rental car for the day and they would not give us a rental. We ended up going to the dealer and got the car back the same day. They didn't give us a rental car even though we had called earlier and told them we had to drive it to the dealer for service. The service manager said he would call us back within 48 hours. We went to the dealership and had a different customer service rep (who was not there) call us back. We were told to wait till the next day and they would call us back. No one called. We had to call the dealer again to get a rental car. We were told that we had to get a rental car from the dealer in order to get our car back. After a week of waiting and waiting on hold for over 20 minutes we finally got our car back. The service rep told us that we had to drive it to the next day to get a rental car. We never got there because we have to get a rental car. We had to wait for the day and when we had to be told they said they had to wait on the day that we had to wait. We were told us we had to wait. The car. We had a rental car. We should have to be there for the rental car. We said we were told us it towed. We needed to wait and we needed to be told us to wait. We would be there to wait. We have to be there
Automotive,2.0,OR,"Took my husband's truck into the service department to have some recall issues fixed. Made the appointment the week before, so they had plenty of time to make sure they had all the necessary parts. Was told that they would need to keep it most of the day, because there were three recalls, but their courtesy shuttle could take me home & bring me back. 

I had to wait almost an hour & a half for the shuttle, which was fine because at least they had coffee. Not even ten minutes after the shuttle leaves, they call to say two of the three issues were fixed, but they were missing a part for the third. The part was being overnighted from Portland, so I could either leave the truck overnight or come back & get it, I chose to leave it as it would have been more convenient.

By two o' clock the next afternoon they hadn't called, so my husband called to find out what was going on. The service guy he spoke to said the part still hadn't come in, but they were hoping to get it soon & be finished by the time they closed at five. He said they'd call when it was done.

This morning at eleven a.m., two days after I dropped it off, we still hadn't received a call. So my husband called them. He was told that the truck had been ready since three thirty yesterday. No explanation as to why we weren't called yesterday to pick it up, which would have been more convenient & no explanation as to why no one had called today. Then my husband was told that the shuttle driver might not be able to pick me up do I can get my truck; my husband is at work & can't leave until almost six, which is when they close.

Not one person apologized. However they did make sure the shuttle picked me up.

As far as customer service goes, the only redeeming factor is the shuttle driver. He was very polite & courteous."

Few weeks months later,  bring car back for repair, the car is stalling while driving, my instrument panel lights are flickering and none of gauges are working, had to jump start the car 3x to get it there. They run there diagnosis again $62 fine. They call me and tell me the alternator is bad, spent another $700+ and have them replace alternator....get the car back, 1st thing I noticed when I go to start car, is my dash lights flicker when starting it up. Let them know and there response "" sometimes it takes a little while/ few miles for system to reset "".

Is not related to this issue at all, even if the symptoms was what I originally dropped it off for !! This place is only interested in taking peoples money and not actually caring if they fix your vehicle.

Automotive,2.0,OR,"I had a water issue with my Rogue.  Turns out there is tubing running from the top of the sunroof down each side of the car that empty's any water out somewhere under or behind the wheel well.  IF these get clogged, then the water backs up and pools inside the car.  I had my tubes replaced in December 2015, and had the mechanic drill the holes a little larger so it was easier for the water to escape.  Dirt and tree sap can clog these tubes.  Unfortunately, this did not solve the whole problem.   Weeks later, the carpet was damp again, so I had to bring it back in.  Turns out that the liner under the carpet was holding moisture and every time the temperature outside rose, the insulation would ""sweat"" causing more dampness.  So they wanted to replace each piece under the driverside, passenger, and both back seat pieces.  These pieces cost about $86 per sheet.  Well, I've alread spent about $400 for the tube replacement and I feel they should have handled the drying out of the insulation under the carpet at that time, cuz now it's too late.  I also waited too long to realize they had in fact not ordered the replacements (after being told they had been ordered), and now the lining is mildewed and my car totally stinks.  Moisture is inside everytime the temp rises.  (Louisiana).  They want another $800 for the parts and labor (almost 5hrs) to go back and replace the liners.  Im beyond frustrated!!  All of this, in my opinion, is a ""manufacture defect"" and not an ""owner defect"".  All they have to do is read some of these blogs and other entries on the web to realize that this is a problem with design that needs to be addressed.  I""ve only ever owned Nissan's (five of them), and this will be my last one!!  And this issue and this dealership is the reason why!"

Automotive,2.5,OR,"Let's just say I walked in a skeptic and left a believer! I absolutely despise all car dealerships in Tampa, except for this one. I feel like the car industry in Tampa is very shady with no one to trust...but after my experience here I feel like I've finally found a dealership I can trust in Tampa now. I owe my wonderful experience to Nick Waddell, Bob Novak, and Joe Hossain- THANK YOU! From the moment I met Nick Waddell, I knew I was in good hands which immediately put me at ease. Bob Novak deserves a lot of credit for putting up with my poker face and hard bargaining, I'm definitely not the easy customer. I'm the kind of customer who wants the best deal and won't take no for an answer! I was adamant about not making a decision that day but Nick and Bob offered me the best deals and made the process so painless that I just couldn't say no. I felt so confident with what they were offering me that I went from being a 'no' customer to being a 'YES' customer. That says a lot because, like I said, I can be a hard bargainer. Last, but not least, Joe Hossain was like the cherry on top...he made the dreadful paperwork process not so dreadful with his sweet and kind manner. The dealership closed at 9pm and these guys stayed past 10p to help get me in my new car. I didn't even hear not one complaint from either one, not even Joe and it was his birthday (Yes he was working late on his birthday)! These guys are dedicated, trustworthy, all-around great people. So glad I went in that day and chose that specific dealership and dealt with those specific people. I never thought I would ever say anything like this about a car dealership. Ever. Props to the higher ups for keeping the morale and integrity of the staff at such a high level! I'M A BELIEVER IN TOYOTA OF TAMPA BAY!!!! THANK YOU NICK WADDELL!!!! YOU'RE THE BEST!!!!"

I've bought a 2013 civic I didn't be a car and had a used car and had a year and got a great deal. 


Bought it I was a good price to buy a good deal I have a 2015 Ford. The 
5 and wanted a number and I just wanted to buy it. 

The one, 

I couldn't buy"
Automotive,4.0,OR,"My taxi was hit an run in the middle of an AC issue that was on going.   I had bought 3  (NOT 1) ""3"", AC compressors from LKQ 2 used, and then this was my fourth, 2 NEW.  They (Cubbon's) installed the 3 one for me and came out to my HORROR and told me this one has a leak in the front where the belt goes OMG REALLY!  It has cost me over $1000.00 in just Freon and Mechanics to pull out and put in the compressor in this KIA Sedona and now it is bad AGAIN!  SO SCREW LKQ'S PARTS THEY SUCK! 
But Diana Cubbon took me in her vehicle and I went and got another AC unit from LKQ (had to wait 25 mins and they knew exactly what I was there for cause I was just there 10 mins before) it was 4:10PM the shop closes at 5:00 I had to start getting mad cause this was bullcrap.  Hand me the 4th frickin AC unit guys!  The shop owner is outside waiting (how embarrassing).  Diana (she kept me calm which isn't easy) gets me and the AC back to the shop and they (mechanics and owners) stay 45 mins. late to finish MY TAXI so I could finally use it in this heat!  THEY ARE THE BEST!  I DID NOT SAY THEY ARE THE CHEAPEST, BUT THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY!  Because by far you will only spend more trying to figure out what is wrong, fix this fix that.  
Get a diagnostic, and I don't mean from Autozone, I mean from Cubbon's Automotive!  Then you can at least know your options on how to get it running correctly, even if it is in stages they can tell you where to start.
They are a great place to do business with. WHY!  
BECAUSE THEY ARE HONEST WHETHER YOU WANT TO HEAR IT OR NOT!
I have a mechanic and he doesn't do somethings and he recommended CUBBON'S!  AS DO I NOW!"
