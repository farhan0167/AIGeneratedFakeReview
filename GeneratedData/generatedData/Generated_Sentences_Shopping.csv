Shopping,2.5,OR,"Needs some renovations: a place to put coats and shoes, more seating, outlets for phones. Runs out of skate rentals and long lines due primarily to a single card reader that still requires signatures even for low amounts; only one person letting people in, too.

Fond of this place but it really needs some changes."
Shopping,2.0,OR,"Steer clear, there is absolutely no customer service once the papers are signed (you're screwed). Don't try to save money, they disrespect that and will double up a cost on another end. They will not care about how you feel about what you'll have to live with and pay for."

So I drove for 40 fcking minutes to get here cause it's the only Apple Store around, only to be told that I don't have an appointment and would have to wait for 1.5-2 HOURS. I'm glad they're being sued."
Shopping,4.5,OR,Super cute clothing here. They were having a summer sale. All clearance items were only $5 for the weekend! I stocked up on some cute summer dresses.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I wanted to like this place, but the truth is, I wouldn't go back. The staff is nice, but I felt like the doctor gave short shrift to the eye exam, the main vision part of which took about two minutes. So I ended up with the wrong prescription, and can't get proper glasses under this prescription."
Shopping,3.5,OR,I have been a fan of the vitamin Shoppe for years and for the most part customer service is always top notch but that's not the case here. Maybe I just came in on a bad day but you never get a second chance to make a first impression. All the staff seemed unhappy today and busy.
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Ladies were super friendly but when it came time to check out, the staff at the register were obviously Christmas help and not familiar with register and questions we had. Manager was too busy on the phone with a personal call to be bothered!  When you pay that much for a product you expect better service!!"
Shopping,4.5,OR,Great idea but he entire experience was over and done in 10 minutes. I received a gift card for this and when I went to do it the price had gone up so they made me pay the extra five dollars- just thought that was bad business practices  ‍ I wish them the best of luck.

Shopping,5.0,OR,Every one of the shoes feel one of a kind. They only keep one pair in only a few sizes of every shoe in the store. I've bought a few pairs from here over the years and I've never seen anyone else wearing my pair. They all feel unique to me and they are truly my favorite shoes.

I recommend going literally anywhere else!

She helped us transfer everything very quickly. She double checked to make sure things were done right. It was a great experience and we will go back next to her next time we need a new phone or service.
Shopping,4.0,OR,Nothing but excellent customer service at this store. The quality and selection of jeans are unparalleled and they tailor them quickly. The salespeople are a little pushy in up selling you but they're just trying to do their job so it doesn't offend me. I definitely recommend Charlie's! Another awesome thing to note is that all jeans are made in the USA! Woo!
Shopping,2.5,OR,"They are a big store with a variety of items.  The wait to get assistance can be longer, so be patient.  Sometimes you have to look for someone and wait.  We have done some DYI's and good price for what we were doing.. but the wait can be a bit much for customer service and checking out is longer... longer..."
Shopping,4.5,OR,Had an awesome experience here. They do a whole foot assessment on you before you try anything on to find the shoe for you and they do custom inserts. Kim took awesome care of me. I will defiantly be buying all my gym shoes here now. I even signed up for the VIP which gives you 10% off and 90 day customer satisfaction.

This Polites Florist location is located on Baltimore Pike. 

I've drove past a few times but have yet to visit the location. 

I received a BEAUTIFUL Christmas tree made of flowers .. roses and pinecones.  See my pic as it is breathtaking.

The delivery guy was really nice and friendly.   

I will definitely use them when I place my flower order."
Shopping,3.5,OR,Do not go here if you want any customer service. If you spend $600 on your suit for your wedding you can't get your $70 shirt steamed. This is unacceptable for such a large corporation that should be committed to customer service. My wedding is in 17 days and I can't even get them to do something as simple as steaming a shirt.
Shopping,5.0,OR,"Stopped by Saturday to have my violin evaluated. Was meet by a friendly staff upon entering. Derek Coons sat with me to discuss the violin. He is truly a violin expert. I learned so much in a comfortable setting. Very impressive and beautiful shop to boot. Lots of people there.Best of all the Evaluation was Free !
Will be doing business with this shop."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I went here originally to check out what cars they had but the pandemic has increased the want for RC cars and they are short on inventory but can help you find and order one still if you ask. They have a lot of parts, batteries, wheels, body clips etc. Super helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I am looking forward to using the track."
Shopping,4.5,OR,Love the experience so far. I walked in. Had questions. Ms Jill answered them very well and clearly that I walked out with a unit. It was what I needed to get my 2017 on track on getting my things organized. Love the customer service they give and renting is very easy process. I can foresee very great long relationship with this business.

With a July  4 celebration at our home, I ran to patio 2000 at the recommendation of another retailer and 2 hours later, great quality chairs are delivered (free) and set up by 2 polite guys. Good value. Enthusiastic owner and staff. Thoroughly enjoyed the process and results!"
Shopping,3.5,OR,"My dad lives in town and insisted we stop here when I needed a new cellphone charger while visiting.

What a cool store.  It is nothing special, probably lower level than Walmart.. but they have overstock of just about everything, name brand of most things. 

Friendly workers.  Simple check out.

But if they are out of something, then they are out of something."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"I just moved to west Philly and their staff was dope. Very knowledgeable and inviting. They gave to options to either be cost effective or to have great quality wheels and tubes for mountain biking. Location is close too so no complaints!
I also thought it was dope that they rent out the shop on Wednesday's for women, bringing a sense of community together."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"Igor has consistently provided me incredible assembly services. The latest was putting together an extremely complicated and time consuming Murphy-bed/sectional/bookcase. As usual he was on-time, provided great communication and left the place cleaner than he found it. This was also at a great value.

They had plus size hoodies which I thought I wouldn't find here and I'm so glad I did.  We got a few souvenirs to take home for friends and family in Missouri. We might have to stop back by before we leave!"
Shopping,2.0,OR,"I have found SO MANY great clothing items here in the many years that I have been shopping at this particular Plato's location! Unless you are getting something that is a big brand, it is almost guaranteed to be $12 or less! To make things even better, they just remodeled the entire store, which was absolutely necessary, it was beginning to look pretty rough!"
Shopping,3.0,OR,"STAY AWAY FROM THE MAGAZINE ANTIQUE MALL. When we questioned the price of an exorbitant item, the store manager actually made my daughter cry. She hissed in a voice as vituperative as her glare and jabbing finger, ""Welcome to New Orleans."" I've never been in a retail store where the service was designed to repel customers, but, alas, there's a first time for everything."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"First time here and my mission is floor trim/molding. 
They have a lot of everything but what I wanted was lacking. 
I need white. 
I need choices
I need some thing that will complement the Shaker Doors in the house. 

I found 8  choices so close to each other as to be little options. 

I ll keep looking , this is my first stop."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"I actually prefer shopping on their website. I have been to the Greenwood store, looking for something I saw on line, but the staff was less than helpful trying to find the item and didn't even seem to know that there was a website... Also it is rather pricey. Fairly good selection ifyou are working with kids, not so good for teens and/or adults."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"I cannot say enough good things about this nursery!  My sister and I are new to desert living and really enjoy moseying around this property looking at all the different plants.  We have purchased many items, which are all doing well, because we were given a care sheet.  The staff is very friendly and patient with our many, MANY questions lol"
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I love New Orleans. So so so much to do. The people are all very friendly. The town has a lot of left over damage from Katrina/Ivan that is just left to rot. In many cases I feel it makes the city look more ""rundown"" than it actually is. But it seems to be coming around a lot more than it used to be."

Told her what we were looking for and her response was ""I'd vote against that""...excuse me?! Who's wedding is this?? She had absolutely no interest in helping us at all! I see why their reviews are so low, should've looked at that before wasting our time!"
Shopping,3.0,OR,This was the worst and probably only bad customer experience I have had with Apple. I have owned a lot of Apple hardware over a few decades. This store showed no willingness to try and fix a 1 day old 15 MacBook Pro that was basically DOA. The store/shift manager basically wanted to get rid of the problem. Very dissatisfied/ disappointed in this store.
Shopping,2.0,OR,This place is horrible. From the front desk to management. Have given them three different opportunities to get it right and failed every time assembling the product wrong and sloppy after telling me they would call when completed and never calling. Made me have to call and wait 30 min just to find my order. Not once but three different occasions. Unacceptable and disorganized.
Shopping,4.5,OR,"Great place for outdoor stuff. Its very clean, well organized, knowledgeable staff. They have a lot of good high end climbing, riding, camping products. I went in for kneepads and wanted to leave with a cart full of fun toys and cloths. It is pricey but it's top end stuff there selling. I highly recommend you check this place out if you need something."
Shopping,5.0,OR,Great place to by plants and fertilizer. They are pricey but it's worth the buy because their plants an trees are healthy and well managed unlike getting them from Lowe's and having them die on you at least from my experience. The staff are friendly and kind as well as very knowledgeable about plants and trees of all sorts! I definitely recommend Aventura Nursery!
Shopping,3.5,OR,Cool place colorful nursery but I wasn't willing to spend double or twice as much for a specific plant I could buy for half as much ( or less) at other local nurseries . I asked if there's any type of warranty ( wrong verb? Or adverb ? Or other form of speech forgive me ) for failure to grow but they said no.

I ordered hardwood floor, bathroom tile and shower floor from Bell, with my contractor installing. Highly recommend Bell Floor Covering if you are looking for great design options and customer service from Michael."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Great place to shop for running shoes.  They apply the individuals running style captured on camera on a treadmill.  Then they go over all of the viable options available to you and have you try out the recommended shoes.  It's like shopping for a new car, you get fitted and you get to test drive.  Highly recommended for the serious runner."

Compare this to West Coast Optical in Center City, which asked for $5 to repair the same spare when I had spent $885 on a pair of glasses. I know where I'll be going next time."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Being my first visit, I didn't know what to expect. The store shares its space with another business. It's very small but clean, well-organized and stocked with good quality essentials at decent prices. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. I consider New Orleans Art Supply a solid resource for artists in the area who, like me, prefer to keep their spending dollars in Orleans Parish."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"It would be a great place to buy golf balls and equipment....

But 75% of the time I go there I leave my merchandise at the customer service counter because I'm 8th in line and there is only one person (slowly) checking people out. 

Not sure if this is a problem with all Dick's or just poor management at this location.

Go somewhere else of you can."

Very happy to have found a quality tailor in the area.
Shopping,5.0,OR,I have spent some what I seem serious $ here. No more. I went to buy some pots and they acted like I was bothering them with wanting a cart and asking for help. Then they wouldn't help load. These are the most arrogant and useless nursery people. Go out to Perrino's  or the plant gallery and get decent service and help. Screw them.

Shopping,2.5,OR,"I think this store would do much better at a different location. The parking is insanely small, people will park anywhere and block you in without any problems. The location itself it's smaller than expected. As fas as Halloween customs they have a good variety. I don't know which days would be better to go to this store but I would personally avoid the weekend madness."

Shopping,2.5,OR,I found them to have a great selection of designer things. I had a nice experience from the cashier that relocated here from Texas. Sorry I cannot remember his name. He was a gem!  So glad I stopped by and he told us about the BOGO on Designer Sunglasses! The place is well organized and cleaned for a discount retailer. I thoroughly enjoyed their store!
Shopping,2.0,OR,Took an hour for the worker to attempt to look up my information on whether or not I could have an upgraded phone. They have no hustle and don't respect customers time. This seems more like a hood hangout for workers instead of a place of business. Customers are least important. Thinking of switching to another company. Extremely low budget service for such a nice area.

They called me a half hour later and said the screen wasn't cracked, just the tempered glass cover that was on the screen.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"I was fortunate to work with Michele Wiese at the LaSalle St. location.  She handled my unusual themed request with ease and excitement.  Then, not only did she ensure that the delivery was coordinated with the arrival of a personalized card, but she was sure that I received a picture of the themed plant before it was delivered. She truly could not have provided better service! And the plant was great!"
Shopping,4.0,OR,"Went there with kids, 1st and 3rd grader. Right there at kids' eye-level there were books with the ""f"" word being displayed at the checkout!! My 1st grader read it.. The owner attacked my 1st grader for doing that, though she has no idea what that means. Very rude lady there. And at the end, just order from Amazon or get from Barnes and noble where things are placed in the right place."

Never going back and I do not recommend"
Shopping,2.5,OR,"Jim Lincoln is the guy to go to. He is helpful, attentive and helps you shop until you find the right merchandise. Everything is good when dealing with him.

The negative is it always seems to take a long time to get delivery (not his fault) and my first experience with the delivery people was not pleasant.

However overall shopping at Ashley is a good experience - must be I have bought twice with Jim."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"I absolutely LUV this place. When their coupon book is out....NOBODY and that means AMAZON can come close to this store. 2 people that I must mention are 
JOHN (the greeter who smiles in his SLEEP) and YVETTE who calls me the ""Breaking Bad"" man. YVETTE is also funny, funny and always a pleasure to see. Many others but I had to mention them. Don't think we ALL don't appreciate your kindness....we DO."

Their staff is knowledgable in everything they sell, and I can't brag enough on the water testing staff and all the miracles they've worked on our green water.  I definitely know where I'll be headed when I'm ready for the hot tub to go by the pool!"
Shopping,5.0,OR,"Sales rep provide great customer service.

I came in with ideas but no plan. The sales rep walked me through options - sharing pros and cons. They carry many herb varieties that look fresh and ready for harvest.

Sales rep seem more intent on sharing their passion than pushing products. Consequently I find myself making smart and purposeful purchases.

A bunny greets you at the register and keeps you entertained while they ring up your ticket."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"While I liked the layout and some of the selections at this place, it was mostly a disappointment in terms of overall selection and price. I typically shop for soundtracks and old metal on vinyl, neither of which were in large supply here. The soundtrack section was thin, and the few titles they did have were the unpopular stuff no one buys. 

I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating, though."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"As a New Yorker that loves my Macy's, I was shocked to see this one so empty on the many times I have visited Philadelphia. This place though has always been good to me when I was in town. I have bought shirts,pants and shoes all on sale. It is in the historic Wanamaker  building and is pretty nice to shop in and walk around on a lazy traveling day around Philly."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I had to move between apartments in the same complex (up 2 flights of stairs) and Bellhops was the perfect service for this! They were on time, fast, and very respectful of my things. They worked hard to get a particularly large couch out of a very narrow room (nearly impossible) and did so with only a few scratches. It was fun having them around and I would recommend this company to anybody."

The staff in this store always seem right there - love it :)"
Shopping,3.5,OR,"One of my favorite outlets. Reminds me of the old National Wholesale Liquidators store. This place is NOT for people Who are loyal to specific brands. Some items are irregular as far as the clothes . They have good prices on most items, especially housewares. Food items seem a little overpriced. Huge automotive selection. I like this store..you'll rarely find the same things twice.. but That's the ""thrill of the hunt""! I love it."
Shopping,1.5,OR,They make it impossible to get help. The are a communications company that works extremely hard not to talk to you. The service is crazy unreliable and they refuse to fix it. They have a take it or leave it attitude because there are no other options in the area. Cable one/sparklight extort their customers and don't even try to hide it anymore. I pay for gigaone service and I'm lucky to get 100mbs.

They do a great job in maintaining the cleanliness of our house and handling any other special requests (shampooing couch etc. ) The products that they use always leave the house smelling great and not like chemicals. They are extremely accommodating with any changes in scheduling that come up.

I always get something sweet or something like a Rocky Patel Sungrown. We luv to sit & watch the traffic pass with walkers, they always look in to see what is going on. You can bring food in if you like plus they let you smoke cigarettes, some do not allow that."
Shopping,3.0,OR,used to like this company but they're shoes are too expensive given the quality. My oxford shoes wore down in less than 1 year. They literally have holes in the bottom. I have NEVER had that happen before and when I contacted the company they said that is to be expected as part of wear and tear. Last time I checked $125 leather shoes should last more than 1 year.

The selection is pretty boutique-y and so they are happy to order items for you. The customer service we experienced was 5 stars and above. I love the super localized touches.

I think it's safe to say that I have found my stitching shop! Looking forward to my next visit."

Shopping,5.0,OR,I had been checking their availability almost everyday the week leading up to Memorial Day because I've had a few bad waxing experiences and heard great things about sugared and bronzed. It was definitely worth the extra effort and the wait going there. I've always been a big advocate for sugaring and this place is the best I've found in Philly since moving to the area. Friendly staff and very clean facilities.

Shopping,2.5,OR,This location was the worst experience I have ever encountered at an AT&T store. Waited over 30 minutes for an online pick up. When we arrived we were asked to go on the waiting list but associates roamed about the store and were not helping anyone. We actually had to wait for an employee to clock in and assist us with the watch pick up. WORST customer service I've seen by far in AT&T.

Definitely a mush for consignment shoppers and sellers."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"Great place for the combination of quality clothing for bargain prices!

It really cannot be beat. Better prices than even tjmaxx. The drawbacks:
1. the fitting rooms are sparse and usually packed.
2. Restroom is located in the second floor and can only be accessed by elevator 
3. You may not be able to find a certain item in your size 

These are pretty normal negatives for clearance sale places. Altogether - great prices and pretty friendly employees."
Shopping,3.0,OR,Warning!!! This is NOT a thrift store location! I wasted hours of valuable time driving here only to find that this location is only a church and after school program! Please don't waste your time like I did. I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about as there is no store here! It's a shady area to boot! I hope I can save someone out there a lot of time and hassle.
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I've always enjoyed coming here since I was a kid! It's very pretty, they have a lot different dining options but this time we sat outside, our server was super friendly and awesome! And the food was delicious! Try the cocoa coffee pasta! As weird it sounded it didn't taste like either of those things and was very good! In the summer they have a great pool area and my parents are constantly golfing here."
Shopping,1.5,OR,"Not helpful and when I asked to speak to a manager she says I am the manager: well you're not helpful nor kind, I had to just leave out of frustration. Can't they get a real manager in there who understands polite useful help? And train the employees. There was a tall kind young man at the front register who let me use his phone to call mine as I searched my car."

Returns are incredibly easy too. Anything within 30 days, even clearance, can be returned with tags and the receipt."
Shopping,3.0,OR,This is probably the most inadequate Apple Store I have ever been too. Being from the Silicon Valley I would expect apple to have a well rounded group of stores around the nation but the Brandon location really made me think different. Every single worker in this location specializes I think in sending you to a new direction and they speak to you as if you are swine. I will never return to this location.
Shopping,2.0,OR,We had a great experience at Bob's! Right away we were greeted by a salesman who helped us through our entire sectional-buying process. We took a while to make our selection and he continually checked in with us and answered all of our questions. At the end he introduced us to a manager to make sure that we were getting exactly what we need. They also have free ice cream and coffee while you shop!
Shopping,2.0,OR,"The most inconsiderate customer service I have ever experienced. If you have a claim for a broken phone,need tech support or have a question they direct you to an 800 number. That is after they ignore you for 20 minutes. Clearly the staff has no desire but to sell the newest device ..with no regard for the customer experience. Do they work on commision ? The attitude of the staff in this store is horrendous."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"What a great little spot within a few blocks of my house. The patio is welcoming and have seen many people with their dogs out there (I have yet to bring the pug, but soon he will make an appearance).

Shopping,4.0,OR,"I can not say enough good about my experience with the owner. She is educated, professional, passionate and just an amazing person who is just a whole lot of fun!  The store is amazing.  I felt like I was in a 1940's movie..when women illuminated class and beauty.  And the prices..you get what you pay for!  If you want low quality made in china..lets just say you will not find it here!"
Shopping,4.0,OR,"We were all very impressed with arrangement!! Everyone at my uncle's funeral and my relatives commented how it was the best and largest of all the floral arrangements. In an era where finding a florist online can be very ""hit or miss"" and the final product does not always match like the online photos, I so am glad my Yelp search led me to this company which takes pride to provide such a very impressive product!!"

They helped educate me on diamonds in general, and they guided me towards the best purchase for me and my fiancé. Brentwood Jewelry was already my exclusive jeweler, but after this experience I will be sending all friends and family their way too!"

Our sales rep, and I forget her name but she was very, very nice, was professional and extremely helpful getting him fitted and matched with his date's colors. In 15 minutes she had him fitted and ordered, and the prom special was very affordable. $99 for everything? Muy bueno! I will update after we pick up the tux."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"Best pedicure ever! I was visiting Nashville from Los Angeles, and we decided stop in for a break. What I love most about this place is how nice it smells. Most pedi places are filled with the overwhelming odor of acetone and chemicals. This spot is calm, serene, and spa-like. Recliner chairs took pressure off my feet and I nearly fell asleep I was so content. Lovely owners, friendly staff. Please open a branch in LA!!"
Shopping,3.5,OR,This is not a discount store. The prices are pretty good on the granite until they charge for cutting it then charge more for cutting the sink hole then charge more for a bevel then charge more for polishing it  and they don't install......after all that it ends up more than all those services combined with installation from other retailers. So the word discount is only in their name. It is not a discount store

I highly recommend the physicians as well as the facility as a whole for eye exams, wide selection of frames, etc. I was welcomed with a smile and exited with a newly updated prescription. I was told my eye glasses (regular seeing glasses as well as sunglasses) would be ready in an average time frame of 2 weeks and I got a text that both were ready before that 14th day! Amaaaazing!!"
Shopping,2.5,OR,Went to Best Buy in search of new washer and dryer.  The selection was great and the service was awesome.  Our sales representative Neil G was knowledgeable and courteous.  He wasn't pushy like most sells representatives at most electronic or appliance stores.  We've always shopped at Best Buy and will continue to do so.  The flexibility with pricing and wanting to help the customer is what will keeps is shopping here.

There's a bar where you can purchase wine and beer or you can bring your own. If you're not from the area please do this earlier in your trip as you have to pick up the candles later. Already looking forward to coming back the next time i'm in town"
Shopping,2.0,OR,"DO NOT, EVER, purchase kitchen cabinets from Lowe's, or use their kitchen designers. Six months of waiting for our kitchen cabinets to arrive (in full and without errors)...kitchen installation is half done after two weeks, while we wait for missing cabinets...no reliable answers, help, or responsibility taken by anyone. The list goes on and on, and on. 

If you ever want to do a study on ""How Not To Provide Customer Service"", I would recommend Lowe's."

Wish this place was closer - they have all of the finer / high equality e liquids and I've never seen so many different options for mech mods and box mods in one store. If you get the opportunity, visit this store and give some love to the local b&m - this one deserves it."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"I walked in and spent 20 minutes wondering the store and was not greeted one time. I walked past at least 3 employees and got not one word. Usually their customer service is great but today was just sad. To top it off one of the ""beauty advisors"" told me the reason no one acknowledged me was because they were busy with the truck. That's not my problem. I'm a paying customer and want good customer service."

The only downside is that it is not closer.
If you have not been there, you gotta check it out."

Plus the entire visit only took like 20 minutes."
Shopping,4.5,OR,It was alright. They didn't have the arrangement i wanted even though it was listed as available online. I then asked for help with something modern / contemporary for a chic friend's birthday. I got something pretty meh for the price and the card was misspelled. Think I could have gotten an arrangement with the same aesthetic value for 40 dollars less at Whole Foods.  Three stars because it was ready on time and hassle free.

They also have your other non-frame goods, like clothes, knick-knacks, mugs, dishes and furniture. The women's clothing section was decent, and I saw many nice pieces.

This Goodwill is tucked behind and catty-corner to the Lowes, so you might miss it if you're not looking."

The people who work here are friendly, but only if recognize them first, and sometimes they're not too helpful. The prices are pretty fair, and unless it's the holidays it's not too crowded. If you need something quickly, check it out, but if it's specialty or you're going to need a lot of help, maybe go somewhere else."

They were red roses, but the arrangement was very haphazard and the vase used was much cheaper than the one in the advertisement.

Final update: They made good and the second delivery was much nicer."

Then we picked out dining room table w/6 chairs on last day of Labor Day sale, saved another $200.00 dealing w/Rueben and Steve the store Mgr. No hassle, no pressure just overall great business acumen, pleasant atmosphere and honest employees. Five (5) stars out of 5.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"The sales people were very helpful assuring me that I could return the shades, (2) if they did not fit. I was disappointed to receive only a store credit when I did return the shades and couldn't find anything in my price range that worked. I assumed a return was a refund, but wasn't told that.  I was looking for two simple shades for a guest room, most shades were upwards of $100 each, not what I needed."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"First of all a kids hair cut is 16.00! Their prices are not out so I guess they just charge randomly anything they feel like. It says on website even kids get towel treatment included in price, didn't get it for either child I brought in. Will not be going back! I could see why now they had no costumers waiting. I feel I was rushed and didn't receive my money's worth of 32.00 for two kids hair cuts!"
Shopping,4.5,OR,My wife and I stopped by on our last day in town to check out some VooDoo dolls. The store has a rustic shop feel straight out of a movie. You walk in and instantly smell the incense and see the tarot card room off to the side. They have a great selection of dolls and other VooDoo products. The shop owner was very helpful in suggesting some incense and oils for dealing with specific issue as as well
Shopping,3.0,OR,Great prices but horrible customer service. They have to hand-sort through binders of invoices to look up your order. The owner Kelvyn talks in circles and reminds me of a car salesman. He's also never there. I had problems with my couch and it took 3 months to address the problem to my satisfaction. The sales lady I had was nice but she couldn't do much to help with the problem. I will never go back to this place.
Shopping,4.0,OR,"One of the best customer services experiences you could ask for. I am not surprised to see that this shop has amazing reviews. I've had the opportunity to deal with a few shops over the past several years, and none compare to this one. Bill and his guys do a wonderful job. I will update and complete the review once my interaction with them has been completed, so far so good."
Shopping,3.0,OR,I ordered 3 pairs of shoes from them online. I was supposed to get 30% off (because they were having a flash sale) but the discount wasn't applied. It took about 3 weeks to get the order and when it arrived they sent me the wrong colour sandals. Trying to resolve it with customer service has been very difficult (they keep asking for me to send pictures) and now the colour I ordered are no longer available.

The shop is filled with beautiful pieces that go hand in hand with gorgeous art. We were especially impressed with the selection of glassware, jewelry, and vintage pieces. I will definitely be back. I ordered a wedding band from this store."

The staff is friendly and helpful.  The products are high quality.  The facial itself is pretty great.  The color is great and the facial itself is perfect.  I love how the facial itself is not overpowering.  I have also noticed that the massage can be more relaxing than the facial itself.

Otherwise the minimum fee is three dollars to drop off leaves or sticks or grass or other yard debris that is listed on their website. 

I love the fact that the materials are being turned into compost and mulch and are not going to the landfill."

Great selection and the service was nice considering I walked in 30 mins prior to closing and these poor ladies just wanted to go home. I don't blame them. Clean. Nice. Respectful. Everything you need from a thrift store. As I continue to explore my new surroundings, I'll update."

Their policy to get it fixed is ridiculous so much for a lifetime guarantee. I should be able to return it. Not mail it out for 4/8 weeks and if it's not broken to their stands they will charge me. Some ring company y'all work with!!!"

Hopefully, I wont destroy my phone again, but if I do... I will be sure to go back to The Cell Specialists."

I guess I should be grateful they fixed their mistake without charging me."

Poor customer service when trying to fix mistakes. Things happen I get it but how you handle it is what matters. Go somewhere else I warn.

My 11 year old was forced to put her 1 item on the rack to be counted prior to going in the dressing room. Isnt that why the magnetic strips are there? Will not return to a place that treats their customers as though they are a criminal. Dressing room personnel was very nasty about what was mentioned above."

In addition to cutting glass, they also perform screen and storm window repair.  Super helpful with great prices."

We were expecting more of a botanical garden with tons of colorful flowers and didn't get that. The scattered animals were interesting but also kind of random. I guess I just expected more due to high ratings and was let down. Also, wear bug spray! I was eaten alive by mosquitos."

Very professional job. Really top notch. They even polished them for me too.

The flowers looked really pretty, although, it looked smaller in comparison to their sample photo online. Otherwise, overall good and will order from again 

Delivery fee is VERY reasonable. I say that because another florist in Sparks was going to charge me $25 which I find exorbitant. Any delivery fee more than $12-13 is just ridiculous in my opinion."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I'm so glad we circled back and walked the five blocks to get to this shop. It was Halloween and they had some sort of event going on so it was packed. Being such a tiny store it was hard to navigate with all the people. Nonetheless, it had oil based potions, candles for whatever you want (love, money, success), voodoo dolls and a million other cool things. We went to another nearby voodoo shop afterwards, and it didn't compare to this one."

Target has always been there as well as Home Depot, but they've added Petsmart which is really nice.  You have your typical fast food joints which are kind of meh, in my opinion.  The parking lot is kind of a disaster and people don't really follow the traffic signs.  Could be better, but has been worse."

We have bought arrangements from Oberers Carmel IN for years sometimes the daily special sometimes not.  This is sad the 2 dozen rose are cut to the vase and dumped in.  The only reason for the 3/5 stars is because corporate stepped in and fixed it by refunding my whole purchase.  We will try again in a few weeks.  Fingers crossed for next time.

The main reason for this review is that I wanted to take the time to thank Diana Lee for the amazing customer service she offered my son and I.

You can tell she genuinely cared about us and making sure we were happy with our purchase.

George is professional, timely and communicates really well.  The crew was also timely and courteous, not to mention they did an awesome job.  I appreciated their attention to keeping the site clean, inside the house and out.  I'm looking for projects to work with these guys again!"

Shopping,4.0,CG,This has got to be one of the worst airports in the world. There is a large number of people waiting in the terminal. The line to get through is long and it is not easy to get through security. The security guard was extremely rude. I was told to sit in the back and wait. I was also told to sit in the back and wait. I was also told that I was not allowed to take photos.

It also bothered me that I called them to see if they offer shopping cart pick-ups when people leave them in neighborhoods (shame on you, cart thieves!) and the young woman laughed at me when I asked...she didn't even try to appease me with asking where it is or telling me she'd tell her supervisor.

Of course you'll find the staples as well, but this whole store is meant to be setup so you don't feel awkward about what you're buying and instead have a good chuckle at it. 3 stars for having too much stuff jammed packed into a little room causing people having to constantly push past each other."

Beyond that,Dr. Denis travels to places where folks not so fortunate need medical attention. He is an outstanding human being and anyone associated with him can not help but be influenced by his dedication to others."

I've made 4 phone calls and left 4 messages over a 1 week period and ""no one"" has returned my call.

Shipping is expensive, even for the East Coast (I live in Northern Virginia), but the total price still beats my local discount nursery (which is far from where I live).  I ordered a couple of different items to find the best balance on quantity and shipping costs, which lowered my unit cost considerably.

I'm sure it will bake in the summer like Logan Square and not offer the cool, leafy respite of Rittenhouse or Washington Squares. The new fountains are nice but they just used the same design at the Sister Cities Plaza at Logan Square. It looks like they've got a lot of events planned for the space, I'm curious to see how that works out."

The owner and staff are more than accommodating and went the extra mile to make sure that I was happy with what I was purchasing (I spent 2 hours in the store trying on jackets and asking them a million questions). Would much rather support this local business than purchase online somewhere else. They even offer 10% off for things they don't have in stock and have to order for you for this reason.

Shopping,2.5,OR,"Purchasing a washer and dryer was quite easy. Arrived at store when we were the only customer. Sales rep asked what were our preferences, immediately showed us his recommended manufacturer, we signed the contract, and the appliances were delivered the Monday following our Saturday visit. Delivery was made at the promised time, delivery men were careful going through the doors, cleaned up the floor, tested the washer and dryer to make sure everything was working properly, and were on their way with minimum disruption to our day."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Saw a lot of men here and liked that because it means the men's clothing here is likely to be more serious than the other clothing stores.

""Like a sale that never ends"" is the motto of this store. Picked up a shirt and a nice wooden chair for the beach thatll be thrown into the back of my truck. Im now waiting in line. This store seems busy and popilar so It looks like I probably wouldnt be the only one recommending Marshall's. Check out was quick and easy."

Keven goes above and beyond as a manager, and I like the way that he treats his staff and other customers as well.  Not only is he a leather working expert, he is dynamic, intuitive and knowledgeable about sales and the needs of modern working artists.  New management at Tandy Nashville means better customer service for everyone in the area!"

The staff is very helpful and friendly . My two daughters like to try everything on before buying anything, the store has a large fitting room so that's always a plus. My dog destroyed my daughter's blouse so I ordered another one online and even though they had to monogram her name, it was ready for pickup the next day . The uniforms are high quality and at a very reasonable price. 
I would definitely recommend Schumacher's."

I was working with no insurance and of course, was a little worried about cost, this location had a wonderful coupon that allowed me to walk out paying about $100.00 for an exam, lenses, and frames. The staff was pleasant, the doctor was lovely and the glasses were done in less than an hour."

Next time have a better communication with your customers, instead of giving them bullshit run around!mystery un rivals, there where extra furniture charges to my account that was mistake by a salesman. So extra furniture was not a loaner, was just extra that u didn't order. And back orders that's too long too write!"

A huge variety and selection arranged by style and color cover the store from floor to ceiling. Don't forget to look in the second building in the back too. They have a very good selection of thread and sewing notions along with other craft items. I recently moved to Nyc and even here there is nothing that beats Rainbow's End for quilting selection."

There are also some fun activities for kids.
Shopping,4.0,CG,They have a no refund policy. The only reason I've never left my credit card number is because I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a product. They should be able to do this in the store. I will never shop here again.I visited the store for the first time last week to look at some things I had in mind for my new home.

I couldn't have had a better associate, Destiny, helping me. She was wonderful finding my perfect dress for me. And when the dress I had on ended up having a stain that couldn't be removed:( she was great at finding the same dress, just a slightly different color. The dress is beautiful. I felt beautiful. I would recommend David's Bridal in Greenwood for your bridal gown needs."
Shopping,3.5,OR,Aidan or how ever you spell his name is not a very friendly or helpful associate. Made the experience bad with terrible customer service. Scoffed when asked for a size 14 pretty much calling me a freak. We spent over $65 dollars and he never gave us a promotion card to get a percentage off on our next purchase. Even tho I over heard him talking about the promotion to another associate. He was prolly angry because he was interrupted while trying to spit mediocre game to a girl there.

Norma was very helpful and there was no pressure (and she was so kind despite our 15 mo old daughter running around). Gary helped with the resizing. My fiancée also ended up buying her wedding band there--a beautiful white gold and diamond band that she loved. They also helped resize her engagement ring, even though we purchased it elsewhere. We were very happy with our experience and highly recommend this store."

Recently had Nick & Steven for my bartenders. They are amazing. Nick took the time to hear what I like and picked a beer on tap that would fulfill my cravings. 

Love coming here on Friday & Saturday nights. Everyone is relaxed and ready to have a good time. Bouncers make sure there are no shenanigans and one of them is real easy on the eyes 

Just learned that there are some community events here. So I'll be coming through more often."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"I came to return some items I bought at the Lowe's in Brentwood. There was no hassle here, the cashier was friendly and polite. I shopped around a bit, and ended my visit in the Garden Center. The entire store was very quiet, not a lot of customers. It looked very neat, everything in its place. The cashier in the Garden Center seemed starved for human contact - he was joking around with me, trying to get me to buy some end-of-season, wilted plants. The staff is generally very helpful."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"I haven't skated or bought a skateboard in 12+ years so I was skeptical going in but I felt very welcomed and the atmosphere was warm and inviting as well. I was taken care of by Stephen who was eager to help and assist me in picking a board and building it as well. The location is a bit hard to find so you have to look for it, but overall, it was a great experience and it made me miss the skater community. Shop was full of positive energy."

Also couldn't find a 2t shirt for under $5 which again, is the same price as Target sells their toddler shirts and more expensive than Walmart or Carter's buying brand new."

d.  At no time during the order process did I receive these instructions.  If I had, I wouldn't have purchased from this company
e.  Long story short, the appliances came crushed, customer service was non-existent, it took 3 months to receive replacements
f.  Christian company?  I think not"
Shopping,4.0,OR,If you shop here watch these folks like a hawk at checkout.  They charge you higher prices than those marked on the shelves and they try and trick you by leaving old sale tags on the shelves and not honoring those prices.  If they are caught they just claim that those prices expired.  Really?!  This is a consistent and re-occurring experience over several trips to this store.  My last experience had me sorting through 4 different prices for the same item.   really pathetic.
Shopping,2.0,OR,"I am giving this location a 3 because even though they had a good variety (colors, styles, size, etc.) the sales people are SHARKS. You will not have a relaxed shopping experienced here. 

I felt that some of the items were overpriced. A fabric loveseat for $979.99? A bit much don't you think? Their delivery price ($80 for items under $1000) also seemed high to me.

They should do a better job of advertising their sales too. Simply slashing the original price of the furniture in red doesn't tell me much."

He was out within a few hours and was extremely professional and friendly. Quickly diagnosed our issue and came back to repair later in the day. I also appreciated that he called 15 minutes prior to let us know he was on the way. If you are in need of a great repair place, look no further."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"If I could score zero, I would've. These people are worse than car salesmen. They stuck me on warranties for items we didn't know, they want us to take the furniture back for repairs because they won't pick it up. And when we went to get a bar stool they owed us they gave me a floor model that was tore up because the manager said it was discontinued, but when I took it back and raised hell the magically made a brand new one appear outta thin air!! Buyer beware!"

Gizmo Pros were by far the best price around (I checked Tampa & Wesley Chapel).  The owner of the store was very friendly.  The job was completed in the time frame he gave me.  The workmanship was top notch.   I would recommend Gizmo Pros to anyone needing a screen replaced on their electronic device.  Will definitely go there for any future repairs."
Shopping,3.5,OR,I have used Zakian on several ocassions for carpet cleaning and they have done an outstanding job.  They got what I think was actually an oil stain or something similar off a carpet that had been on it for years and after many attempts by us and another company to clean it up.  You can't even tell it was there it basically vanished!  They are a little pricey but if you want a really good and really deep clean they do an excellent job and are worth it.

The Apple ""Geniuses"" are very knowledgable and genuinely interested & determined to help answer any questions you may have as well as providing the highest of standards in customer service to each & every customer.

One draw back that I must mention; is that the Apple Store is always packed. Making it a bit difficult navigating through all those crowds.  

I would recommend visiting The Apple Store on the weekdays Mon-Thursday to avoid the stampede."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"This is one of those places that has a very interesting clientele, similar to what you would see on the people of W mart pages. It pays to know normal retail store prices to know if you are getting a good deal or not, some items are off brands that cost more than one you would find at a regular retail store. They have a decent selection of produce and a small refrigerator/freezer section as well. Careful driving through the parking lot, for some reason people are quite reckless around here."
Shopping,3.0,OR,Bought two pairs of shoes from them - the James Oxford and the Ecuador. I can't say those pairs will be my go-to. The Oxford is too stiff (referring to both the leather material and the bottom sole) to wear even after 5/6 times wearing them out and the Ecuador is way too snug and provides zero arch support. Their product line is very elegant but I'm just dissapointed by how uncomfortable it is to wear. I don't understand how they come to garner so many positive reviews on their website

I would definitely recommend this place. I will be traveling from Lansdale to get my bike inspection done and all other repairs from now on.
Shopping,5.0,OR,"I first went into Awesome Jewelry to have some adjustments and repairs done to a couple watches. They made the adjustments to one watch band and added a battery in the other for free, which truly was awesome. I ended up working with Jeff to design a pendant and it turned out great. It was completed very quickly and he stayed in communication with me about the progress. The overall price was better than anywhere else I had inquired, and overall my experience was excellent. They even threw in some cleaning supplies."
Shopping,2.0,OR,I read a review this morning about this place been low class and I thought the reviewer was been plain rude. But I came (I have been here in the past about a year or two ago) and she was right! I walked in and out in 20 minutes top. I didn't buy nothing at all. No one was welcoming. The displays gave me a headache. It just seemed like a whole bunch of crap in different little rooms. Sure they had okay prices but I didn't even bother. Never coming back.
Shopping,3.0,OR,"I hate this parking lot.  And the bathrooms are gross.

And maybe it's just because we're always working on the house so in the trim section, but there's a dude there that ALWAYS is I guess auditing the molding (which I can't believe because their stock is so hit or miss) and refuses to get out of my husband's way.  Which makes my husband batshit, which then makes me batshit, then the dog wants to cheer us up but doesn't get that a soggy toy isn't going to help the situation...oy."

Picked up my order that evening. I was early and it was already ready. Was having a hard time choosing the appropriate card

Shopping,4.0,OR,"Tampa Airport is one of my favorite airports when going to Florida just because the service is quick and easy and everyone is very nice and help you when your lost or not sure of the next step. Sometimes the rental car places can get a little crazy and also don't have a lot of staff when you have about 40plus customers and only 3staff, so I would say that's the only down fall to Tampa airport, the airport has a lot of different restaurants to choose from, and nice clean place."

Even when they answer the phone they sounds bored and can be quite short if not rude in person and on the phone.

Upma was not friendly at all and kept complaining that her next client was already waiting which made the threading feel rushed. And made me feel uncomfortable."

After that, that same attendant called the person that was behind me, knowing that I had been standing there for a while. It was like she didn't even see me! When the attendant was finished and it was my turn, she left. Very rude! And to think that I only had 2 items for checkout (chocolate bar and a key chain)"

The store is clean (a major bonus) and prices are extremely reasonable. I've even been able to haggle them down on a few things by buying multiples or pointing out imperfections.

My favorite part of this thrift store is it supports the Homeless Emergency Project, a wonderful program that gives back to the community."

Tried to exchange 2 pairs of shorts for a different size from Xmas and both shorts were the same size bought on the same receipt and they refused to exchange the pair where the tags were accidentally removed. This should have been a situation where common sense and saving customer loyalty should have been practiced. Thanks Lululemon for ensuring that I provide feedback to everyone who wants to shop at your store.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"I stopped in to inquire about a Bonneville and some accessories - I first spoke with Max and then talked to Mike for awhile about some different options - It was one of the best retail experiences I've ever had. Both guys were very knowledgable, were comfortable explaining things in a way that was accessible, and were really friendly in general - they even introduced me to some of the guys in the shop. When I'm ready to buy there is no question that this is where I will buy. Hands down best shop ever."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"Bought a couples class for my girlfriends birthday and we both really enjoyed working with Saul. You can really tell when someone loves their craft, and with his patience he was able to teach both of us beginners how to make a couple of different pieces. I like to learn and make, and Saul really lets you do as much as possible for a beginner. He is an excellent teacher and if you don't smile when you see your piece taking shape, you don't have a soul. Thank you guys for such a wonderful experience."

Parking is a breeze, concession items are reasonably priced for an event venue, and the bathrooms are always clean. The event staff is also fantastic, I have never had an issue or bad word to say about any of them. Everything about the actual venue makes the concert/game experience perfect. I was impressed with how quickly we were able to leave through the crowd afterward, which just proves how knowledgeable the event staff is! I love this place."

Well worth it and I'd recommend to anyone that wanted to try something different.  Saul, the owner was super chill and friendly.  Good times...."

If you go see him with a drawing already made, he's going to make you get it bigger, with more detail than you want and probably on a different area of your body (like he tried with me).

Such a cool family or date night activity."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"Plato's Closet used to be affordable with their prices at their old location; but since they've moved to the new location they are really expensive now. In some cases you're better off going to the mall to purchase the things they offer. If you're looking to sell your gently used items and want bang for your buck, try using Poshmark or some other online sales site. This place will give you next to nothing for your items, even if the item is fairly new or designer. Wouldn't really recommend this place unless they have a really good sale."

I would recommend Sposabella to all brides who are looking for a beautiful dress and the experience all brides deserve.

Also, for the record, my lawn is completely green, it's professionally treated, and this is too late in the year to begin a treatment program.  Of course if they were a professional company, they would have already been aware of that."

I've never had a great experience here and I've never really been able to get exactly what I went in for. The last time I was here was a perfect example of why I don't like coming to this store. The employees are unfriendly and walk by without acknowledging you, they have a lot of product out of stock, and I can never get anyone to help me find anything..
I left empty handed."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"This place is the W-----  of dispensaries, starting with the location??
 (horrible parking situation)  Then you have to figure out what the policy of the day is, stand here, go stand in the bushes? (I get uncertain times)
 Other issues are what can I buy, how much per day?, management actually had to post only one visit a day? 
 PA medical doctors aren't helping this situation in dispensaries either, by giving out licences like candy at Halloween!
 To many issues with the growers, etc, pricing. Yikes.

So I called the store I purchased the products and was advised there is no appointments this week. I received call back advising that I was called yesterday - no message left and they could deliver next week. Only thing positive is the gentlemen who delivered the first part of my package they were absolutely amazing. The poorest care, after the sale, I have ever received."

Absolutely the best place I've taken her for different classes, art, music, sports - her skill development and confidence has grown immensely and the staffs knowledge of her strengths and areas that she isn't confident in have helped by not pushing her before she's ready.

If this means wearing an ill shaped bag which could be mistaken for a dress if it wasn't ten sizes too big than do it. Sewrob is awful. The stiching on my alterations was poorly executed with the fabric puckering in places its not supposed to pucker. Oh and lets not dwell too long on the cost. It cost more money to alter the clothing I brought than the original price of the clothing. We're talking upwards of $50 per piece. Just awful.

The other cool part is that they sell mason jars. Probably not food safe anymore, but if you're planning to head to the beach, you can buy one to collect shells."

Shopping,3.0,OR,"I don't shop here often but recently had a sale which was unbeatable! I ended up getting about 20 shirts and shorts and so on for maybe 2 bucks each. This deal was really a shocker. Flip flops of many colors ended up being about 73 cents each. I think old navy was having this crazy sale which may people should always be on the look out. The items sold were things that would fit anyone's style.

Visit them, especially when they have crazy sales! Their normal priced clothing are also cute! They also have some cute little items for your pets ^_^"

She made me feel comfortable and beautiful, and included my personal preferences while helping me find my dress. I went into David's Bridal excited but nervous at the same time and came out with a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders because I found my dress in 90 minutes or less. I can't wait to wear my dress at my wedding, and I thank Dana and the helpful staff at David's Bridal for making me feel special!"
Shopping,2.5,OR,"I walked into the store today with the intent of purchasing three new suits.  Not a single sales associate made a move to assist me.  The closest I got was some furtive eye contact followed by a lowered head and walking the other direction.  I immediately felt like I was an intrusion on their day.  After circling the store twice trying to find suits in my size, I finally just walked out.  And as I left, not a single sales associate even acknowledged that I was there.  The sad thing, I assume they work on commission."
Shopping,2.0,OR,"I've sold here every now and then for the last 4 year. I usually sell clothes I get as gifts and don't want. Recently they tried to tell me the clothes I was trying to sell were worn out. They still had the tags on them and I've never worn them. They also only offered me $15 for a brand new pair of black tims with the tags and box. That is nuts. The new employees are very rude, and judgmental. I don't even feel comfortable going there anymore, I now have to travel to either Bensalem or Deptford to feel welcome."

Today I walked in looking for a gift. While some of the things are extremely expensive, there are some very reasonable options. Additionally, there are many sales going on right now. The staff was friendly, and I ended up getting two unique wine glasses to go along with a bottle of wine I already bought for the gift. I'll definitely be back if I need another gift."

It only took a few days to get my computer diagnosed and then to fix it was even faster. Originally they gave me a 1-3 week time range, but I got a text in 1 day saying it was ready for pick-up. AND it didn't cost me an arm and a leg. They are very fair with their pricing and my computer is working good as new with nothing lost! Thank you so much!!"

They did not disappoint! We requested special songs that weren't listed on their repertoire list and they played them beautifully. It truly made our ceremony so much more special and romantic. Also, Eric was so easy to work with and communicate with. Due to the pandemic, our wedding had to be postponed twice and Eric was extremely understanding and easy to work with through it all. Couldn't recommend Main Street Music more!"

I walked right in, found the USPS dept. and was greeted by a cheerful USPS associate who had just what I was looking for.  From what I could see, they have everything you would need to mail anything. 

I've always know about this USPS satellite location but it was never on my 'radar' when I needed to mail a package.  Now, I can't image dealing with the big USPS location on Belcher Rd. ever again."

Someone went and got me a cart for my little things.  Later, after more shopping, someone offered to carry my rug, and then my picture.  And the cashiers were super friendly and even laughed at my jokes (and I'm not that funny).

Signage as to where to park and a new store sign may be in order and the website could maybe use a little love, but the content, the prices, and the service were reeeeeeally great!"
Shopping,2.5,OR,"I've noticed that items at Best Buy rarely have price tags but most of the featured sale items are displayed with the price displayed on tags. Unfortunately store personnel/management are NOT competent enough to put the correct product on the shelf above the price.  You only find out when you bring your items to the register. 

I have visited the Goleta store periodically since I've moved to the area (probably 5-7 times now) and EACH time - 1 or more of  the items I went to purchase were a different price than what was posted.   Ridiculous!!!  Buyer beware."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I really like thrifty threads! I come into see what unique items they have and this is my go to donations spot.  They support the Julian Center and their mission.  The store has clothing, housewares, furniture, and other random bits.  The store is smaller than goodwill locations and the employees are kind.  There are nice quality items in the store and there is always a lot to look at.  They also have some higher end items that have been donated and you can get at a good price, but higher than you would expect at a thrift store."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"This place is very cool. The chicks working the front were very helpful in finding me a smaller nose stud. I like something very dainty and they found something that met all my desires.
They even put the jewelry in for me before I left. This is a huge thing for me because sometimes I have a hard time changing my jewelry and I get frustrated doing it, ans it ends up sore. They cleaned the stud, my nose, and quickly changed it for me and I was on my merry little way. 

Thank you, Black Hole Body Piercing for exceeding my expectations :)"

I remember going to a place like this when I was a kid, but totally thought they were a thing of the past.  In fact, I always just assumed that the ""pharmacy"" sign outside was just a remnant of a past life.  You probably did, too.  It's for real!  A great place to buy local without sacrificing on selection or cost.  I'll never walk all the way down to CVS again."

Also there is ALWAYS a line at check out. (At least on weekdays after 5 PM and Saturday mornings, which is usually when we go.

I can't count the number of accidents I've very narrowly avoided by rubber-necking at the clothes on my way past this charming, chandelier-ed little store. Once I finally decided to park the car and venture inside, I was met with about what I expected, price-wise: that is, it's hella expensive. But it's beautiful inside, the clerks are smiling and unobtrusive, and the clothes really are dreamy. Give it a look-see if you have a lot of money or , failing that, a lot of self-control."

I came in to look for an item and was told that I would have to return it to them.
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Made an online order.  Tractors supply was about 25% more expensive then everyone else, but decided to support the new store down the street and it would be easier to deal with if the item had a problem.  After hearing nothing for a week, my order was canceled.  This is not a bad review about the staff at the location, but the overall company as you should not sell an item you don't have on hand.  This isn't the stock market after Amal.  Now I have to have one shipped and it will not be near when I need it."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"Last Bedrodsians store I visited was in Sacramento 2005!!

Never knew I'd be living in another state and upgrading another home..

I've watched the store in stages when it was being built.

We walked in and was very impressed with the showroom.

Basically allowed to roam the warehouse, take pictures of the barcode, and they can create an invoice with info and pricing.

Although they only carry slabs (no prefab)..

I liked the choices they had.

I had seven different slabs and pricing was various $$$$..

Still surprised the prices were lower than I thought.

Still need to find a fabricator, and probably one more estimate on slabs.

Im really glad they are in town."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I have been very impressed and pampered at Evolutions Medical Spa. I felt very welcome and my initial consultation was handled with a lot of care and patience. The atmosphere is exactly what a client desires. Relaxing, calm, beautiful, with the nicest, most knowledgeable staff. I have been extremely happy with my results. I congratulate Dr. Perkins on his accomplishment in bringing such a great spa and staff to Santa Barbara, with the latest in technology as well. I visited a couple of other medical spas in town before entering Evolutions. What a difference."

I called Leon's and they said "" it's not our problem, I think it's covered by your warranty-I dunno. You have to call Bosch"".
I called Leon's a second time and they said they would arrange maintenance but ,of course, they didn't.
Then I called Bosch and they said "" if its an installation issue, the warranty doesn't cover the problem and I will have to pay for the service provider""
I called Leon's back and they said there is nothing they can do."

I had a boring plain necklace transformed into a Mardi Gras worthy piece in about a week by the wonderful Georgia who took my vision and made it better than I could ever imagine. Not only do they offer prompt customer service, you can also learn how to make your own pieces through their classes! 

You could spend hours browsing through all the beautiful beads!"
Shopping,4.0,OR,The Clearwater dispensary was great when they first opened but now....twice recently I ordered on line and got confirmation they were working on it and never heard from them. Called next day to only find out it wasn't pulled but sorry they didn't have product I ordered. The same issue happened to my husband a few wks ago. But with his order we drove there to find they didn't have it. Clearwater has really went downhill. Sure if u are new customer they treat u great but after they reel u in....they don't care anymore. To many places around to put up with their charades!!!
Shopping,4.5,OR,"Well art is art. and There are so many styles. And Dali is definitely a style of his own. To be able to see so many pieces of his, hung in such an interesting space, is almost overwhelming. If you have an inkling of being a Dali fan, this place will win you over. If you are a Dali fan, this will be a stop of a lifetime. There aren't enough words to speak to the life's work of this man. He followed his own drumbeat and this museum captures the song of one of the world's top artists.
This is a must visit for all."

It moved underneath my skin when she tried to change the jewelry and now its irritated and rejecting even though it healed perfectly and wasn't irritated for 6 months. If it wasn't put on so tightly I would be able to keep it but now I'll have to get it removed, so sadly a waste of money and I really liked having it."

Essentially all they do is mow my lawn which takes about 5 mins a few times a month.  I have discussed the weed issue with Aurora Marin the Residential Operations Manager and she told me that I would have to increase my package to alleviate the issue.  This past week I spent two hours pulling weeds which I thought I had paid them to do.  Been using their service for almost 2.5 years - think they would treat their customers better.

I really enjoy the ease of uploading my prints from home and being able to swing by the next day to pick up my order. The quality of the prints are better than your Walgreens or Walmart, plus you support a local business! Orders rarely take more than 24 hours to process. The prices are affordable and comparable to most other printers. 

I've had to get prints made on archival quality paper and Roberts gets the job done. Although it is downtown, their parking lot makes getting in and out of the store a breeze."

I have told them about the problem. No one seems interested. No one in my family will ever deal with this place again.

I was told that if I didn't pick a different dishwasher, they would charge me an extra $100 dollars to ship the microwave because my order was now too low for free shipping. Needless to say, I canceled the rest of the order. Horrible customer service--when you offer a bogus item for sale, and can't supply it, charging extra to ship the item that is available is just nasty business. Avoid this seller."

The one time they did have it, it was pre-made I'm all for making stuff in advance, but when you run out of the advance prep you don't just say you're out of the ingredients.

We were told that the item in question was indeed in stock at this Lowe's (about 12) at the Lowe's in Arnold.  We couldn't find any at all.  No one could tell us where this item was/is.

The fruits aren't that inspiring or super fresh, people act like they haven't seen cut fruit before.  It's all about that acai which is prepared ahead of time. 

Maybe this used to be the ISH, but new juice bars do the same thing better with well designed spaces, seating and great customer service.  Now why would I pay premium prices for a food court establishment?

Sit down. Be humble."

Shopping,2.5,OR,"We ordered a fridge that was delivered to our new home in Caldwell. However, it didn't work. It did not cool 8-10 hours upon receipt as promised. We called Home Depot incessantly, at least one phone call a day. They bounced our calls from customer service to Maytag/Whirlpool, to the delivery dept., etc. A week later, we received a loan fridge that is half the size of our fridge. Two weeks later, we still do not have our replacement fridge and the delivery date has been pushed yet again. We don't appreciate this Home Depot's lack of empathy, especially having two young children where a refrigerator is integral."

Google and Yelp reviews led me here and Michael Fox responded very quickly to my email inquiry. I called a couple days later and spoke to Becky who was super friendly, helpful, professional, and she mailed out the gift certificate to me which I received in a short four days time. I really hope my friend enjoys this bookshop as I am a fan just by their customer service!"

I am a spa and massage junky so I have visited many spas and have had a lot of different massage therapists but Jacob hands down is THE BEST! This guy is truly gifted, extremely passionate about making others feel better, and tailors your massage to exactly what your body needs!

Upon arrival, I was greeted by a cute personalized welcome sign. I was the only one dress shopping so i had Mackenzie's undivided attention. She listened to my every wants, likes, and dislikes. I probably tried on around 10-15 dresses and Mackenzie was just super patient the whole time. It was definitely an amazing bridal experience. & i said yes to the dress that same day! Its been 4 months since i committed to the dress and i haven't had any dress regrets at all."

On a side note, when shopping at the Manayunk store, their manager Lisa let me know about their bridal sample sale that they have on Friday, November 28th.  I'm not getting married, however I'm letting all of my girlfriends know about the event!  The dresses are amazing, and the customer service is spectacular, I KNOW that this is something worth checking out!"
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I came across this shop while my husband and I were visiting New Orleans for a convention. 

It was the best 'shopping' find ever. The owner has a great aesthetic and an amazing knack  for finding and selling 'rare', 'one of a kind', 'must have' items. I literally visited this store every day of my visit. I brought a sterling silver vintage clutch, a Whiting and Davis metal mesh purse, gorgeous custom jewelry and a vintage ladies night jacket.. The owner sells these AMAZING one of a kind leather bags I strongly feel everyone must have. 

Everyone must visit this shop a least once in your lifetime."

To having Joel and Ed design jewelry for my staff designed after my company logo. They also were able to take an antique (circa 500 bc) celtic non functioning cloak clasp and make it into an amazing broach for my wife. They manage to find parts and service for my many mechanical watches and are my go to place for my hard to buy jewelry for wife. The classic/perfect hometown jewelers, beautiful store, great selection and they really care about their customers, many of which are multi generational customers."

The doctor was very nice and the receptionist was great. The eye exam was okay and the exam was free. The receptionist was very friendly and did not try to upsell me. I was the only one in the room and she did a great job. I will definitely be coming back for my eye exam and Dr. Barnes will be my new go to doctor for glasses. Amazing place.

I took the fridge back to the store and they were able to get it fixed in 30 minutes.  I wish I had known that they would have said no.  I have to do it again.

The store is very small and not very well organized. There are some things you can't find in other stores. They had a few things I liked, but it was not very organized. There were several items I was looking at that I didn't want to buy. I didn't think they had all of them. There were some things I liked but not quite as much as I wanted.

The actual store was pretty small. There was a lot of clothing, and then there was a clothing section. There were a couple of older ladies in the back, and one of them was wearing a white sweater. I think it's pretty gross to see people wearing a sweater in the back.

I also like that there were plenty of stores that were pretty big on men's clothes. I didn't see anything like that in the men's section, but I"

Shopping,3.0,CG,"We LOVE Costco!!!! This one is an amazing place to stop in and find some great things! 

The employees are all very friendly and helpful and the store is clean and organized. The only thing I wish I could give 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food was very expensive. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they are a little overpriced. I live in a city and I can't afford to spend over $1,000 for a dining table. I would not recommend going here."

I had an appointment the week of November 8 at another optician and was unable to make a purchase because Visionworks has a hold on my insurance. Furthermore, they do not answer the phone. I was on hold for 20 minutes!  I had to relinquish the appointment and drive over there to get my insurance issue fixed. Now it's another week for another appointment.

They are a great place to kill an afternoon or evening just looking at what is available in print media these days.

Starbucks inside is.....starbucks.  Nothing to get all blathery over.

I don't really like their magazine section...seems to be just strangely organized.

If you need a book now and you wanna go here...I wont stop ya.

Will I go back?  Probably but not as much as Sundance or Borders.

Would I recommend to a friend.  Sure if the above are out of it."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"Definitely the place to go if you're in need of household items in bulk. Especially since this is the only Costco in the city, they've maintained good customer service and cleanliness since opening. Costco also has special deals on electronic items if you're in search of a new television or computer. In comparison to Sam's Club, Costco provides more unique, organic items you may not find in other stores, whereas Sam's would provide more in-store items your usual Wal-mart or Target may carry. You have to have a membership to enter and purchase items in store, but be careful. You may very much spend more money than you anticipate!"

They had a limited selection of home goods, and for some weird reason, in between the racks of the clothing were essentially little shelves that held miscellaneous goods, that would have made more sense somewhere else on a real shelf.  Like, toys, kitchenwares, random crap, in between racks of clothing.  Am I supposed to go through every single rack of clothing, down every aisle, to find something worthwhile hidden in between?  Ain't nobody got time for that!"

I am a fan of promoting safe sex so think it is wonderful to have an approachable store where a woman or a man can pick out condoms. The staff seemed friendly and our group had a good time oohing and aahhing over all of the penis and vagina gadgets. There was an underwear section in the back that I glimpsed at and was surprised that they looked mostly like granny panties! Guess that goes with my earlier comment - something for everyone."

I think his name was Josh or Hugh or some other 4 letter word.   This was at the 3330 E Speedway location.  I used to love this place, but I will never go back due to this treatment.

Both times I went during one of their open house type deals, where you pay like $10 and get a reading from some random person sitting at a table. Definitely interesting if that's your cup of tea.

They have a good selection but nothing made in America, just Vietnam and China. I did get a pair of Altras. They sell some products made in America like the Xinglet lighted vest.

They have recycled/reclaimed yarns and every type of fiber imaginable. Even if you don't knit or crochet, go in and enjoy the colors. They also have needlepoint/cross stitch pieces and patterns for sale. Prices are totally reasonable for the uniqueness and quality of their products.

My only complaint is that they don't sell any of their yarns in tiny amounts. I use yarn and fibers primarily for embellishments on crazy quilts, so I don't need a whole skein. I wish I had the cash to buy whole skeins, though, just to own them!"

I spoke to them about the extra charge and they said they would submit it to their manager and call me back the next day.

After stopping in there a few days ago cause I loved a tee in the window, I saw that it hasn't changed much- the jewerly is still silver. The clothing is artsy and embroidered. Frida Kahlo images are silkcreened on totes. 

Frankly, there just isn't that much in there. It doesn't have a whole lot of much else- sunglasses maybe. Inexpensive espedrilla like shoes. Candles. Cards.

I called back and was told they were out of town and that I would need to get the furniture back to them.  I was told that they would call me back.  I called back and was told that

The only problem we have had was I ordered 3 chairs for pick up the next day, I called before I went to get them and they said they were ready for pick up, so we went but upon arrival we were told there were only 2 chairs ready for pick up.
I then went and talked with the sales person and he got us the 3rd chair off the floor, as we were unable to return to pick up the chair another day.  So they made it right for us."
Shopping,2.0,OR,This is my first review ever!  My father sent me flowers for my birthday.  There was some miscommunication and a bouquet of flowers got sent instead of the arrangement paid for.  After a few phone calls they did send out a new arrangement  that looked awful. They asked for the old flowers back.  I don't understand who thought the arrangement was appropriate to send out to a customer.  The flowers didn't even last two days.  It was such a disappointment.  I literally found nicer flowers in Aldi's. I wish they would of put some effort for a future repeated customer or any attempt to make this right.

I walked in and was immediately greeted by the friendly sales associates and then proceeded to browse the vast selection of instruments, including ukeleles, kazoos, and harmonicas, all of which I plan on getting to increase my repertoire of instruments!   In fact, I was informed that Bridgeset also hosts meetings for the South Street Ukulele Club and will guide ukulele players of all levels in learning popular songs (ie: Beatles).  On my way out, I signed their mailing list and assured them I'd definitely stop back in to purchase my ukulele and some other supplementary instruments! These guys ROCK!"

I wandered the store for about 15 minutes and no one acknowledged my presence. I finally got the attention of a gal at the back desk. I told her what I wanted and she found someone in the back to come out and talk to me. The salesman said that I would need to make an appointment (7-10 days out) and return at that time. He also said that custom cabinets would take several months to build.
I found the staff to have an air of pretentiousness. Certainly not showing any desire to help."

First they give you misinformation, second they do not honor there word and last the employees are rude. You do not need to be an a-hole just cause you are standing near a cop. You could at least provide some service at not act like you are bad a! You are not. Your managers are a little more helpful but at the end of the day they told me apple phone customer service cannot be trusted and to never drive an hour if apple phone or online tell you something as it is probably not true."

They'll push a tigher size than feels comfortable when you first try them on. Listen to them. The pain you endure for the first 4-6-8 weeks gives way eventually to a stage I like to call mini-muffin-top, which several months later gives way to the fit you really wanted in the first place. Hopefully by that time the luxury-denim fad is still going strong."

Another reason for loving IRB is that they're pretty damn stylish. I have yet to do it, but I would like to add this space to my rotation of businesses that make for good popup office hours.

I have stopped in your establishment a total of four times, two of which resulted in sales.  Each time I felt unwelcome, like I was bothering you and your negative attitude was palpable.  

Now, I travel a lot and I always make a point to stop in the few remaining camera shops  that are to be found. I always try to buy something even if I don't really need the item. I'd like a world where you can still walk in to one.

Now, your attitude if continued would likely result in your business joining the ever growing number of ex-camera shop owners. I for one would think twice before stopping in your shop again."

The selection doesn't quite contend with Books-a-million, but this establishment also refuses to force unnecessary promos at you during the check out. 

It's an experience when you visit this place. Stationed in historic downtown Edwardsville, they could not have selected a more quintessential piece of real estate for this vintage bookstore. They have something for every faction and generation. And because these books are mostly used, they're dirt cheap, yet their presentation is of brand new quality. 

A well-groomed establishment. And you can expect a short tour of the place upon first arrival. Cordial and professional owner.

Everyone at TFP is incredibly nice and accommodating, and isn't that what you want when you visit a business? Can't say enough about this place, other than that if you enjoy your anonymity at CVS or Walgreens, you don't know what you're missing here. Five stars all the way!"

I am not an artist by any means but Jessica, who guided us through our design choice made it so much easier and fun. Her artistic ability and suggestions really helped so much and if I made an error or something wasn't working out right she had a way to work around it. 
I highly recommend giving this a try! My painting is not perfect but I was happy with the end result. Thanks Jessica! You were awesome and so very nice!"
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I am so grateful that the Humane Society has this thrift store, so I can donate items to benefit animals! I know they cannot completely control the products they sell because they have to rely on the generosity of donors, and the variety of items donated. Since i want to do all I can for critters, I donate the best items I can find in my home whenever it's time to clear space in my closets and shelves, or change furnishings. I appreciate the people who work there, as it is clear to me they care about animals too. I choose to give to this thrift store over any other, because this is my charitable organization of choice."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"The fact that I was in no way prepared for this impromptu rent-a-bike adventure doesn't mean I didn't have a good time. 
The fact that I was almost killed when my fellow adventurer flipped a bitch in the middle of the sidewalk, sending us careening in to the well-manicured grassy area nearby couldn't even ruin the sense of sheer 5-year-old-like excitement I felt at seeing a bike built for two! WIth a basket!!! 
If I hadn't been wearing a dress I may actually have peddled and would have been happy about the fact that this was potentially considered exercise.

They will sell you things you don't want or need.  I spent $250 in here for a pair of shoes and they were all ripped.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a bit overwhelmed by the customer service. I went to go to pick up my phone and I was told it would take about 4-6 weeks for the phone to be fixed. I called and they said they would call me back and they would give me a call back. When I got there they were on hold for an hour waiting for me to come back to them. I left the store and walked out of there with my phone fixed!

They had a lot of unique things to choose from. 

They also had a lot of specialty items.

She listened carefully to what I wanted and I ended up picking the first dress she pulled for me over any of the dresses I picked myself. Every other bride and bridesmaid that came in for fittings while I was there looked beautiful and happy--one bride even told me that Melanie came up with the idea to put 2 dresses together to make her fabulous custom dress! All of this and more at a very wide array of price points. If you're looking for a great salon with a kind (not pushy and not snooty) staff and a gorgeous selection of gowns, Sincerely Yours is for you!!"

Soooo, why only three stars?  Every time I go to the register area to pay, I have to wait a very long time.  Each time only one cashier with a line of five to seven customers waiting to purchase.  Once I waited in the checkout line for a while, then dropped books on a shelf and left.  

It equates to going to a restaurant, having a delicious meal with fabulous service, then waiting forever for the bill to arrive."
Shopping,1.5,OR,I am extremely upset. This company charged my credit card without permission!! I have not ordered in over 6 months. I have left 4 messages in the last 3 days and no call backs. I told them I would not be using their service ever again and yet they still calling me to get supplies. I Never gave them permission to charge my card on auto payment. I did pay for orders as I received them with a credit card but never did I give permission to bill 6 months after my last purchase. Do not use!!!!! They have no right!!! Claim was filed with banking company who will hopefully resolve issues. DO NOT USE.
Shopping,4.5,OR,"This store is my true definition of happiness!!! Everytime I go in here I better have the afternoon free because I look at my watch and it's definitely an hour later. The aesthetic of this brand is perfection. Everything flows so well from home decor to clothes. And it has been that way since I first discovered it in high school. Whoever is in charge of visual here is a gift from God. Also their candles and books are amazing. This Nashville store always has the best selection in the sale room!! So peruse around, look at all the pretty new things and then buy something from the sale room that is just as pretty just half off."

At the start of my experience, their parts guy told me they could not get one of the tires I wanted, and that I should order it elsewhere. I did that, and then when it arrived, he told me they could not instal parts unless I bought them there. They eventually did the instal. To cap off the whole bad experience, the tech who worked on my bike was insulting to me when I picked it up. If I could give these guys zero stars, I would."

I would need the combination of two younger sister's discounts to be able to afford the stuff at Charlie's.  What drew me in was a pair of shoes in the window.  With no price tag to be found, I asked ""how much?""  ""$195.""  ""Are they lined in gold!?"" I returned.  At that point the clerk knew I was not buying anything and quickly ignored me.  They have some cool stuff in here, just nothing I would waste my paycheck on."

Now I have to tell you, I have only been here one time but it was a great experience.  The salesman asked us a few questions, I looked at a few bicycles and made a choice. We ended up getting a great deal and I can't wait for it to be delivered. 

Would I come back here?  Of course I will."

The proprietor couldn't have been nicer and service was super fast!  Very fair pricing to do a flat tire repair on the spot.  I am very appreciative for Bokah being open on a Saturday afternoon, as they truly saved the day and allowed us to continue on our ride for a couple more hours.  Thank you and I will definitely be back for any bike repair or parts that I need in the future!  Stay safe!"

Because I was unable to get the watchbands I wanted at 2 other places, I looked on Yelp and saw the excellent reviews for this place. When I went there, I found the review to be accurate. Angela was particularly nice and helpful. I got one watchband right away - it's perfect - and the second one had to be ordered. Then the second watch stopped working before they installed the watchband and I didn't want to pay for repair, so they gave me a refund on the order (minus a small shipping cost). I am very pleased with my experience. I will return and recommend it to others."

The three guys who showed up ten minutes EARLY were professional and even funny. They roll with the punches, which is great, since I'm not exactly my best self on moving day. They were also really smart and seemed to work there to pay the bills while they wait for their art/music/whatever break. Smart is crucial (so is spatial reasoning), Philly row houses and apartments being what they are. It took some pretty heroic maneuvers to get my stuff in, but they did it with a smile. And about 15 jokes. Would give them 10 stars if I could."

I also ask about the set on the floor and was told there are 60 other people who have purchased that set so are they all gonna wait months to get their furniture. And Carol house is still selling this set

I had heard the women here were rude, but what I experienced was beyond a qualification of rude. The shop's sales women were exceptionally nasty and unhelpful. We were a group of women in seek of a very special dress for our friend's wedding. They watched us like hawks, making us feel as if we were more of a bother than a benefit. When others came into the shop it was the exact same experience. On the way out of the store, one of the sales women nearly came to blows with one of our girls. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or money!!"
Shopping,4.5,OR,"This is a family run business by some very friendly and patriotic people. They fixed a gun of mine for a great price and and did a good job, and from what I saw the guns and ammo there are well stocked and priced as well. Cole (the owner) is a great guy and you'll have some interesting conversations with him about our American history while your in there waiting. His wife and son work there as well and are always eager to help out. This is far from the stereotype of many gun stores where the staff are rude and don't care. Just a great atmosphere to be in. Certainly one of the best places to go in Tampa!"

They told me about the two rooms for $49 and I said sure, we'll throw in his bedroom too.  Then the guy gets here and tells me it will be $79!!  What?!  Then  he tells me it's because my living room area is over the maximum square feet allowed on the ""special"".  The guy who sold me the two rooms for $49 NEVER said anything about their being a room size requirement.
As far as the steam clean, steam cleaning is steam cleaning - no problems there.

Perhaps the planners needed to balance information that would be interesting to people of all faiths. I had expected a theater that would run short documentaries throughout the day. Also, When I saw the room to record a memory, I had hoped it would be a place to talk about the Jewish immigrant experience or another important time or fact about American Jewish History, but the questions were general about camp or food.

I also expected a cafe that would sell traditional Jewish food with a modern spin.

The event space itself was great and perfect for the speakers to present. The AV was sharp, they clearly know what they are doing.

Vision part of appointment went ok but was told only need to sit in the waiting room for people to dilate for 10 minutes. Well about a half of an hour later we left at 11:10 AM. It should never take over an hour for a vision appointment in my opinion. The doctor got caught up with another patient and she left us hanging. What's MY time worth?

For the most part, everything was in order and relatively organized, but there was trash and detritus on the floor, and some parts of the store were empty, which lent to an abandoned-feeling air about the place. 

I saw lots and lots of nice coats and jackets, though -- even in the summer, which seems like a good time to buy such things, because they are less expensive! It's not just coats, though. There are toys, home goods (like water bottles, cutlery, flatware, etc.), towels, shoes, jewelry, purses. Lots o' things."

They are a certified Apply technician facility. They couldn't have been nicer and suggested a liquid damage repair, but were very clear there is no telling if it would work. They communicated via email every step of the way and were responsive to my update calls. They repaired additional internal damage they found under the same repair fee. 
While the process eventually didn't work, these guys were terrific!!! And the store is beautifully laid out with lots of options for Apple product sale and repair. They are the best."

Went up front and found the pallet, and while checking out, informed the cashier that I would like 3 bags of pellets, and pointed to the pallet of bags. Another cashier overheard me, gave me a look of disgust and told me they didn't have any for sale. I pointed the pallet out to her, informed her what the gentlemen in the back told me, and she just repeated that they didn't have any for sale. Guess the app showing them in stock and the picture of the pallet is a figment of my imagination then."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"As a vintage lover, collector, hoarder, etc, this place is absolute heaven.

There is so much to look at and I only wish that I could have had more time to search through it all! I made a visit there specifically to look at Trashy Diva items, as no store around me carries the line and I wanted to try them on. The staff was very polite and helpful, and were an absolute joy to chat with. I ended up leaving with a dress that I had been eyeing for a while at a nice sale price.
Fun fact: they offer layaway!

My next visit will be specifically for vintage. I can tell there are hidden gems in there waiting for me to find them."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Bought NuCore floor faux wood / acrylic floor, figured with its premium price, it would be a premium brand.  Scratches VERY easy (shoes, etc), and rep from the store said there was nothing that could be done to eliminate scratches.  He described paints available, but said the scratches would still show (?).

Literature said it was very scratch resistant - NOT!

Learned NuCore is not even a company, but a store brand, one of their priciest.  Nobody from store would even come look at it.  Gave me a claim to fill out for removal.  Extremely disappointed - scratches are so apparent everywhere - especially in daylight. 

Will never do business with them again, and have more rooms to do."
Shopping,2.0,OR,This place sucks harder that a cheerleader on prom night. In addition to not stocking perfectly good cables they always force monster cables and higher end brands on you that retail for 100s as much. And they don't even use lube when screwing you on those. And absolute worst of all is the prices you get online don't match to store sales. So if you don't pay attention you won't get the online sale price. And if you want the sale price when you check out you have to piss off the 9 people behind you while you're finding the merchendice price online. AND ..AND when you call the store for an availability and price check they give you the ONLINE price.

Shopping,2.0,OR,After a horrendous experience with Kanes Furniture came to Ashley's in search of a sofa. We were so pleased to have professional and honest people helping us the entire time. We had to wait for the ottoman to be delivered after the sofa but that was explained up front and we were ok with that. The delivery department was on time for each delivery and send reminder texts and even allow you to track where you are on the delivery route in order to have a better idea of what time they will actually be arriving. The delivery men are quick to put any pieces together and take away all trash. I would recommend them over and over as compared to Kanes.

I had them drill a safe Larry was out of breath in 10  minutes. He complained how hard it was . 
After speaking with several  lock and safe companies without mentioning the name they mentioned Houdini .They mentioned Larry  . It took him a total amount of 25 min to open a safe he charged me over $ 1100 he also did not fix it he wanted an additonal $350. 
It was a basic fire safe. I guess I was the fool for paying them but they would have charged the CCard anyway. Use Houdini if you would like to watch your money disappear ."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"They originally quoted me $50 to repair the cracked glass on my daughters S4 Galaxy. The DIY repair kits sell for less than $15 on ebay so that sounded fair to me but when my daughter and I met at the mall the price had gone up to $95. We decided to go for it since we were already there and had it done while we went to lunch. By the next day a bubble formed in the middle of the screen and before we get back to the mall the new glass cracked. The Fixitpro people refused to honor the warranty offering to do it again for $75. These people are overpriced, use substandard replacement parts and don't honor their warranty."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Definitely a mixed experience with these guys. They called to confirm the time with me the day before, but then on the day off they were nearly two hours late because they had a different time in their system. They made it up by sending an extra two guys to help me meet the time I needed the pod complete by. 

I only had them loading some moving pods, and when unloading them at my destination found a number of damages, including broken lamp shades, torn fabric, scratched wood surfaces and completely destroyed screws from my bed. 

I know they were rushed to get everything loaded, but the damages along with the timing mixup definitely didn't lead to a good experience overall."

Side note, we ended up the tour at Cafe Du Monde and I didn't realize that it is a cash only establishment. The other woman on the tour gave me $20 to buy beignets and a coffee. While this has nothing to do with the tour, I was touched and thankful for the good people in this world and wanted to recognize that."

I walked in to get 6 balloons. I understand it is prom and graduation season but to tell me they can't blow up 6 balloons until 2 1/2 hours later is absolutely ridiculous and terrible customer service. I walked out without buying not only those 6 balloons but any paper products I needed. I will go elsewhere. If they are that swamped with balloon orders for other things they should invest in another helium machine to work on walkins. I did not know it was necessary to call an order in for SIX balloons.

Also great lipsticks which is my addiction. Only negative is some lines aren't here like Armani. No sales tax on your purchases either. Store should have more pre packaged samples to give away.

I was called out I'm front of the entire store and it was extremely humiliating. A simple Pat on the shoulder and ""you can't do that"" would have been acceptable.

Fast forward a few years and doesn't feel quite as exclusive as it did before, but it's still good-looking stuff.  It's unapologetically preppy, but there's enough variety to allow you to find something for the office and something else for that crazy weekend lawn party that Muffy is throwing on her veranda, just off the polo grounds.

Fun to poke around the garage areas as well as inside the shop itself.  Liked 'The Pink Panther' dvd playing too.

After I selected my bike, (I got the Verve 3 Disc Lowstep) he guided me around the store, suggesting accessories. I never felt any pressure to purchase anything extra, and Louie was very knowledgeable and candid about what would be best for my bicycling needs.

It is half a block from my place, so it is extremely convenient, but the space is cramped and even though I walked into the store before 3 other people, I was last to get waited on.  

The reason it is getting 4 stars is because when I first moved into the neighborhood, I had some overflowage in my bathroom and ran to the hardware store to buy a mop and bucket.  It was slow in the store and the sales guy was nice enough to come back to my place and give me an education on how to deal with said overflow."

They both went above and beyond the call of duty when she began feeling weak whole shopping in their department. They made sure she got safely to the parking garage while my sister went to get the car and drive to the closet spot to pick my mother up. They both stayed with her until she was safely ensconced in the car. This was after their expert help they provided in finding the lingerie she needed to buy. My mother is sorry she can't remember the colleague's name, but she is grateful for both their help. They say Nordstrom is service oriented, but Dillard's equally deserves that reputation."

We bought a Hybrid body board and the owner threw in a little discount just to be cool. it is not my neighborhood shop but always worth a stop. Check out the 60's and 70's surf films on DVD.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"I'm a very inexperienced runner, but I've decided to start running. In the process I developed plantar fasciitis and I decided it was time to buy the appropriate shoe for my foot and gait. They didn't do the video analysis, but it's not really necessary. The staff ended up finding a shoe that takes most of my pain away and fits the rest of my foot comfortably and is perfect for my stride. Unfortunately, the shoe is really ugly but I'm not running to be fashionable. 

I browsed a little bit of the store and I was surprised to see sports bras in larger sizes. I didn't buy any because they're really expensive, but now I know which brands to look for. 

I'll definitely be back."

I made a really cool dog treat jar customized with my puppy's name on it. The next time I went I made personalized Christmas tree ornaments for family and friends.

The owner of Mobile Pros Nevada, Jaison, explained all my options, quoted me a great price and even came to my house to do the installation.  What could be easier.  His price quote was the best l found in Reno and it could not have been more convenient.   His final price was exactly what he quoted - no extra fees or charges.   I would recommend this business to anyone interested in a remote start or for auto stereo for their car or boat."

I just moved into my first apartment and needed new bedding for my new bed, lights, a hamper, and a trash can. I found them all, but couldn't fit it all in my cart and didn't want to try to pull two carts through the store. So I decided to leave the hamper and trash can and come back later. I waited too long and of course they've been snatched up since, but the store is also very low on inventory in general just 4 days later."

Thought I could pay the difference and get the pictures These are digital prints. Does not cost them a darn thing. They would not do it. I would need to pay another $99. I admit we made a mistake but this is horrible customer service. He had 15 head shots. When I did this I got a good 35 -40 shots; if not more. This really makes the store look bad.

Guys got me in on short notice, took care of the window, and I was done in under half an hour. The loss of stars was for the attempts to upsell - I am sensitive to this as a woman - and the proposed charge to diagnose a radio problem. I'd probably go back, especially for tinting. but I almost always have my guard up around car shops - just like being a chick in a bar, you have to be careful to make sure some guy doesn't try to take advantage of you, and this place was better than most but I'd still watch it."

But we walked in with very specific instructions for the stylist that we were working with her. Her demeanor from the beginning just seemed off. She was not personable and just seem to be destracted. She couldn't even string together an intelligent sentenence. We sort of took over the appointment since the stylist was useless. I complained and she returned with the manager. The manager was nice but by then it was too late to save our appointment. We were done - couldn't get out of there fast enough."

Both  representatives already made up their mind that insurance would not cover it.  Instead of helping me go over my benefits, the female representative acted like I was inconveniencing her.  She looked at my benefits and quickly decided that it was not covered.  She quoted me a price of $549 before adding in all of the costs.  Keep in mind I i already owned the frames.  Truly low rent and not worthy of the brands they carry.  I had a far better experience at Target."

We went to the store without any research into competitors, pricing etc but to just buy.  When we were told there would be a $40 delivery charge unless we were veterans, we replied that maybe that consideration should also go to very loyal customers.  They refused to adjust the price or delivery charge.  We went home and bought the same unit online, at a lower price and with no delivery charge.  Here was a loyal customer, detemined to support a local business that was forced to buy on line by a very disinterested company."

They claimed they had been very busy and had not had the chance to call the other store.  The guy said he would call the other place immediately after we hung up.

I've visited a few Racks and this is the worst one I've been in. There is stuff just everywhere and I feel like I'm visiting a hoarder. Management needs to step it up - clean and reorganize this place.

I heard Amazon has a store with no employees, just walk in and out by using you phone. Maybe this location would like to try that.

They are a tad bit on the pricey end but priced appropriately for the brands they offer.

Stopped in Trend Eye Care a day after making an appointment, and was greeted by a friendly front-office staff and a bright room. The reception staff worked through a somewhat complicated insurance situation and after a short wait, I was in the examination room. An assistant got me started with some quick tests, and Dr. Dinh was in shortly thereafter. Following his examination, I was off to look at glasses, picked them out and had them all set up within about 20 minutes. The next day I went to pick up -- super easy (they even tightened my fiancee's glasses, free of charge).

She never steers me wrong and will always be honest about how you look in the items you try on. While perusing and enjoying my complementary bubbly, I also found a very cute ring that I HAD to have.  I cannot wait to be able to come back and shop here again and enjoy some ""girl time"" with the associates!

There were so many cool and interesting things to see. I didn't plan on spending money on the first visit because I didn't have much to spare but we ended up spending $7 and we both bought things we wanted and needed. The merchandise was reasonably priced and worth much more then we paid. I will 100 percent be going back at least once a week. They have frames, fabric, rubber stamps, scrap booking items, beads, sewing items,Jewelry, lamps and so much more. Can't wait to go again! The resource exchange is my new best friend."

The Dyson service man was intimidating in appearance and did not smile.  He ""sighed"" and took my vacuum into the back without explaining what he was doing.  He came back in a few minutes with an angry look and said ""someone tried to break the filter"".  Obviously, as I am the owner and user, he was accusing me, the customer.  Maybe I did break it, but obviously I didn't intend that. He could have very nicely explained what I was doing wrong instead of mishandling this transaction.  Had this been the case, I would now be leaving a positive review."

I am not saying she's a jerk, but I'm saying that she is a great hair stylist. If you are going to spend $40 on a haircut and a suit, then I think it's worth the $20-$40 you save on the haircut and suit.

I bought a wig for 199.99 that had a 20% discount and some mousse for 6.99. The total price should have been 166.98 before tax. With tax, @ 8%, the total should have been 180.34. As you can see in the picture, a charge for 16.56. This is the tax the store charged me. I should have been charged 13.36. Instead the shop owner charged me 8% on the total before the 20% off on the wig. SO DECITEFUL.

I called 6 times to order new part (to have someone come out and fix it after we received the parts). I finally received the parts on July 24th and now there is no availability for someone to come fix the $3,000 furniture I purchased. So much for the $250 5-year warranty.

There was a Ben Folds section but no Ben Folds in sight. It's Nashville, how can you let your stash get so low. For shame.

It was less then 5"" in pvc and glue!!! Ridiculous! I'm usually not a sucker, but that day I was. NEVER AGAIN!

They usually ask you to make appointments, so if you try to walk in and they don't have he manpower to serve right then they will ask you to come back a little later or make an appointment for another day. This might annoy some people, but it is so nice to know that they are taking quality time on you rather than quickly getting things done so that they can get to a lobby full of people waiting (like some other places in the area do).

He continued to talk about the base, to get my message across I said ""I literally just told you I am not interested in a base.""  He continued to tell me that doctors recommend the base ... etc etc. I thanked him and told him to have a good day, then walked out without looking at a single mattress.

The then excuses himself, walked over to the manager, talked to her for a while, then comes back and immediately hammers me again. He obviously got some coaching from her to hit me again.

Wonderfully, because we didn't start eating until 8:30, the chefs had a complimentary appetizer to curb our appetite, which was called spaghetti pie, and it was delicious!

I'm very pleased with the service I received and will definitely be going back again for all of my jewelry needs. They also have a great selection of jewelry and accessories.

They had no idea where to put them. They told me I had to wait 30 minutes. I was in and out within 10 minutes. I had to wait 30 minutes for them to get in.

Shopping,5.0,OR,"All I have to say about this place is WOW! First, the beautiful smells captivate your nose from the outside. Once you walk in, your nose is wonderfully overwhelmed by all the smells. When we went, the owner was there and immediately greeted us. He gave us a tour of the place and their soap making process plus had us smell a bunch of the different ingredients. We also got to meet Soapy, super cute dog. They took a GIF of us using a repurposed old camera. Then the owner walked us upstairs to show us his inverted camera (not sure of correct name for this) super cool. Definitely got some soaps to take back to Texas with me and I plan on ordering more stuff online for personal use and as gifts!"

Long story short our refrigerator did not come as scheduled.  I was upset at this point and driving over to deal with it when Tristan the guy I had been dealing with from appliances is called me.  He offered to find me a comparable refrigerator and have it delivered the next day.  We ended up getting to the store, worked with Tristan to pick out a replacement, and I ended up putting it in my truck and installing it myself.  He was very helpful and we were very glad to be out of our jam."

Great inventory selections, I do like the lotion that they sell here, personal opinion, I am not an expert, but I really do, it goes on nice, has a good fragrance and I don't feel greasy afterwards. Always wonderful vintage and gift ideas through out the store. There is a wonderful boutiquey area in the store and she always has great jewelry finds in addition to items for the home (tables, chairs, lamps, table top items, decanters wine glasses, etc). Always a different store, and you can actually move around the store (instead of things being piled so high and deep you're afraid to move, not in this store). Also these great wall hangings made out of plates, very awesome."

Shopping,3.5,OR,"I really don't want to write a review because I want to be able to get designer clothes at thrift store prices.  The store has many positives - it's well laid out, it is clean, the staff are pretty friendly and helpful, and the selection of gently used clothing is huge.  Do come here if you have time to browse and re-check the racks. Do come here if you're willing to put 50 items in your cart (seriously, grab first, cull later), do come here if you like paying $4.95 for a White House Black Market sweater.  There are daily deals, ""senior"" discounts (like Bealls, if you're over 50 or just bring along a friend who is over 50), and mailing list coupons.  This isn't your average thrift store."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"This event/market is very pleasing to the eye.  It's sort of like flipping through a design catalogue because the organizers set up the displays almost as if you're viewing different rooms/sections of a home.  Much of it is antique pieces, some have been refinished with some handmade items mixed in. This is very elegant and pleasing to the eye. I'm a big antique freak and I love the treasure hunt but sometimes it's overwhelming because at most stores things are all over the place.  Gather lets you breath and see things in a coherent way and you can imagine using the items in a similar location/way. The prices can seem moderate to high but if you're looking for a special piece or a gift it can be worth it. Lovely."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"Dear Yelp Diary
Im big size girl and this place has very few selections compared to most Ross. Unfortunately, it is convenient because I was too exhausted to drive to Jersey so I settled for Philly shopping. I like going to different neighborhoods since the more upscale ones usually/more often than not will have more and better things to choose from. Is that just my hallucination or does anyone else notice this too? Do you think bringing a Ross to a lower income area means the better looking items wont sell? Think again. I think Id rather drive to like Willow Grove or more upscale neighborhoods to find a Ross...just because of this little unspoken thing retail management pulls based on areas on income and based on different neighborhoods they plot themselves in.

I appreciate how they have a portion of the store dedicated to all things about film, making it easier to find what I need. As well as spend more time in the area of the store where I want to be. Also, Roberts Camera does a great job of almost always have a reasonable size of film in stock to choose from, ranging from Kodak ColorPlus to Kodak Portra 800. My only wish is that they provided a service where the film had the option to be rushed. However, I would recommend this place for any beginners getting into digital/film or even if you're looking for a place to buy your cameras or camera pieces of equipment."

Shopping,2.5,OR,"I'm still mourning over the closing of the Moorestown & Echelon Macy's. This has always been my least favorite Macy's around, but now it is one of the only options. 

The store is really big and has all of the typical departments you would expect in a Macy's. As a part of the Cherry Hill Mall, the parking lot can be crowded and inside the store can also get pretty busy. I've had to wait in line for a dressing room here, but you can walk around to try to find different ones. 

On my most recent visit, there was only one person working the shoe area which led to inconvenience and delays for people wanting to try shoes on or check out. 

Overall, I still love Macy's but I'd rather just order online."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I had an amazing experience with this store, Loree is the lady to see! She is straight forward doesn't try to make a bigger sale and extremely honest. I have been putting off getting a new mattress for months, I have had poor experiences in the past with purchasing larger furniture.  I bought mid level, I didn't want a temperpedic  mattress and bought a brand I was comfortable with. She said it was the top seller with the least amount of returns. I was sold. Their return policy is straight forward and simple! I could of paid cash but opted for the 6 month interest free financing. They will be here tomorrow to set it up for me. If your looking for a great price and no pressure, this is the place to go."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"I bought my fiancées engagement ring here and the service was good. Quick and what I wanted. 6 months later and the diamond is loose in the setting. Brought it in and they CHARGED us to get it fixed! A diamond should not be loose in 6 months and they certainly shouldn't try to charge us to fix their own mistake. We were going to go here for our wedding bands, but not anymore. Poor work on their part. Won't be going back. 

Update: After getting in contact with David, who initially sold us the ring, it turns out that this was a misunderstanding and we were not supposed to be charged for the fix. They are reimbursing us for the charge and reached out to apologize! Thanks to David for reaching out to fix this!"

We found the perfect chairs for our living room and every day since, living in that room has been the tops. The chairs are comfy and beautiful additions to our home. Enormous thanks to Matt Frick for making our experience such a delight. We were well taken care of throughout the process, from selection to delivery. He had great advice and continued to follow up until the day our chairs arrived. The cherry on top was that my dog got a sweet goody bag of dog treats just for visiting the store. I can't wait to go back. Hopefully, whoever reads this will stop in. This store is a total score. Definitely ask for Matt Frick. He is incredible."

Without a doubt, Gino said that they could be, despite one of the sole's having a hole on the bottom.  He put new soles on both bottoms and stitched up a seam that coming undone on the side.  Not only is Gino a warm and personable man, he stands by his work if anything should go wrong after the repairs.

You'll have to be flexible on style - many in my size were quite...flashy - but if you can find a couple things you like and would wear cowboy boots on the regular you'll be happy. I have a pretty common size and wasn't able to find three styles I would wear, so I left empty-handed. The staff was really friendly, though, and I'd stop back in again if I found myself in the area. 

Sidenote: the best deal is probably the kids section. The boots are priced around $70, meaning each pair ends up being under $25. The kids stuff was super cute and it'd be a great souvenir that's more unique than your standard city theme t-shirt."

I mean I've emailed every online frame distributor and my frame is discontinued. Mind you my lenses cost $300.  So, Ricky offers to tint the hideous white trim from the frame he has.

To get a grilling skillet to cook my bulgogi over the grill without losing my meat to the charcoal gods. It was only 7 bucks! This is a skillet that has holes in it so that you can still get that grilling smoke flavor into your food. Great for grilling veggies and seafood as well as thinly sliced beef for bulgogi.

From their online site, I knew that this store had one. I walked in and didn't know where to look. I asked a clerk, actually she asked me if I needed help, and within 15 seconds, showed me where to look. Out of the store in 5 minutes. Love good customer service.

They claim that ""isn't their issue"" to fix... but if the work was originally done correctly, we wouldn't have this issue. I understand mistakes happen and a couple tiles may need to be replaced, but 65+ tiles is unacceptable and terrible work. Save your money and your time and don't use Rite Rug!"

Nick was so helpful in tweaking our Ikea kitchen design (which we purchased through IKD, www.inspiredkitchendesign.com) and was extremely flexible with scheduling around our contractor. The install guys, especially Travis, were punctual, professional, and extremely skilled. They showed up on the day and time they said they would and were done on the day they said they would. They made extra trips back over the following weeks to finish trimming out the cabinets after the appliances were in. They were a pleasure to work with, were reliable and helpful, and we love how our kitchen turned out. Our Ikea cabinets are beautiful and 100 times more functional than our old cabinets. I would strongly urge anyone who is considering new kitchen cabinets to use ModerNash."

When asked for reassembling the sofa, the guy said he has never done it, were highly reluctant to do the reassembling work.

They later reaffirmed my great decision to switch when I called in for a prescription refill just before the holidays (which was awful on my part), and Steve went out of his way to find my prescription from another area, had it shipped over, and then personally delivered it to my house on a holiday when the pharmacy was closed.

Shopping,3.5,OR,I really enjoyed my experience! Got my conch pierced by Louis about a week ago and the healing process have been great. Louis was informative but I would recommend anyone that is new on getting piercings (like me) to have questions ready before you go in (especially about the cleaning/healing process). My ear stopped hurting after the first night and it barley hurts now even if I bump it on accident. The facility was clean and I appreciated how Louis placed the piercing because he mentioned how if I wanted to change it into a stud in the future this placement will allow it to be visible (which is something I hadn't thought about bc I really love the way the hoop looks). The price is also very affordable. The photo was taken 2 days after initial piercing.

After confirming three times that my order would be delivered on a specific date and having a delivery person confirm, a sales person changed the delivery date, WITHOUT my authorization, because part of the order would be there the next day.  Who cares?! I paid the delivery charge, deliver again the next day! The bulk of my order was delayed AFTER I confirmed three times!!!  And, so far no compensation for my wasted day waiting on them to deliver an order I wasn't going to get on the day I specifically scheduled. If time constraints allowed, I would cancel my whole order and go somewhere else. This is NOT the kind of customer service I like, especially when I spent quite a bit of money at this place."

Not only did the color look AMAZING (it was EXACTLY what I wanted), but she was SUPER careful not to get any on my face where it might get a reaction - first stylist ever to be that careful.  Walked out feeling like a million bucks!

They fedex'd the requested ring size to our home address in no time.  The new ring fits perfectly!  In the meantime, they were incredibly polite and friendly to us.

The baskets were for slat walls, not wire walls. When I tried to return the $28 items, it would be a non-refundable $60. UPS and FedEx all said I should have a return label so I called. The first person said we ""could talk about"" refunding me $60 when the items arrived, and the second person said they would send me a return label. I did not get the label and ""Could talk about it"" does not sound reliable. After 2 months of emails, nothing has been solved and I haven't had reply since 11/15. I even offered to exchange but no response. That ""No Hassle Return Policy"" isn't correct. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE"
Shopping,4.5,OR,"So museums are weird to review because you have to take everything with the perspective of the reviewer into account. 

On this note, the NOMA has a lot of variety of paintings and cultural pieces from all over the world, which makes for a great variety of pieces. I believe this variety will allow you to find at least one section in the NOMA that you'll enjoy. Whether that is cultural pieces, oil paintings, or modern art. 

But then you only have one or two sections you enjoy, which is what happened to me. 

Beyond that the museum is nice, it's laid out well and the special exhibit on Mel Chin when I was there was amazing. For me this museum is a nice visit if you're in the area but I wouldn't hastily recommend it to everyone."

I get that people are probably dumping all sorts of things at Goodwill, so I'm sure the job of taking donations can be frustrating at times, but what business shuts down in the middle of the day or has workers bust out of the door, into the parking lot, and start yelling at people who are dropping off  donations the business has asked for?

Found this place because it claimed to be all artist made, real masks. Purchased 3 masks that were $10/each (pretty cheap) even though I really wanted the $100 masks, but these were gifts and I couldn't spend that much. Was really happy until I walked by a tourist stand in the market only to see the exact same masks I purchased, which were being sold for $4 each, with all the other junky fake tourist masks.

The only reason i go to a salon anywhere is for a trim. I can wash it and straighten it myself. Not only that but she didnt even style it the way i showed her i wanted it. I ended up coming home brushing the curls out and putting coconut oild it because it was dry. I am very disappointed and it really messed up my day."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"What brought me to Zia? I recently  discovered a long-lost 78 rpm record my uncle (who was a Marine stationed in Hawaii) made for my Dad back in 1947.  I have no way to play this record so I thought maybe the folks at Zia could help me. They directed me to Draco's studio nearby for assistance on digitizing it. That will be my next stop. I sure hope they can help me convert it.

While I was in the store I decided to check it out. Yes, the vinyl record selection is huge as well as the wide range of CD's. T-shirts and gag gifts galore. 

I have lots of old vinyl albums and CD's I'll probably never play again so it's nice to know a place like Zia's is available when I'm ready to bring them."

The Barnes Foundation is located in the heart of the historic Haverford Mall, and it's worth stopping in to see.

If you are looking for some basic T-shirt designs, go to the Gold and Silver location. They have a lot of different designs to choose from. There is a lot to choose from and most of the items are made in China. I love that there is a section of clothing that is made in China, but it is hard to find anything that is made in China. The staff is friendly and helpful. If you are looking for some unique jewelry, go to the Shops at the West End."

My roommate & I have had issues with regular vacuums because of all the hair that we both shed so we finally decided to just call a cleaning service.  After doing some research on Yelp, I found that KC Carpet had great reviews so I reached out and found that they were also the most affordable.  The owner replied to my message right away and kept in touch until the day of the appointment.  The cleaners came early and finished their work in 35 minutes.  They were so nice and helped move the furniture around as needed to get all the carpeted areas.  I will definitely be using KC Carpet's services again!!"

He did not try to sell me on lenses even after I had told him what I wanted! He made sure that my order would go through without any of the ""it's gonna be a special order"" nonsense. LensCrafters prides itself on having glasses ready in an hour and he stood by it. After three locations in different parts of California, this one finally had everything I needed. I was able to order over the phone and they're having my order shipped to me. Don't waste your time going to Santa Maria, Santa Barbara gets it done. 

Give Doug a raise or something, he deserves it."

I shopped at Junkee for the several years I lived in Reno and was able to furnish so many unique pieces of clothing for my wardrobe from this store. The prices for most items I found were in the $5-$20 range, with a few spikes for new items. I can't tell you how many compliments I got wearing pieces that I found here, skirts, blouses, shoes, belts, dresses--even rad Burner wear. 

On top of the great clothing, I love their music selection, store design, and general bohemian atmosphere. I was able to attend several Burner costuming parties, and the festive vibe was infectious. The staff has always been cordial and helpful."

I broke my ankle just days after reserving and didn't want to cancel but they accommodated me graciously and even provided a wheelchair. My husband and I received a wonderful, comprehensive 2 hour tour with docent Duane. He was very knowledgeable about the flora and fauna and history of the garden.

The sculpture trail is cool but needed some trail repair, bring shoes that you don't mind getting muddy in case you slip while negotiating work sections of trail. It also seemed that a few of the pieces were in disrepair, a water feature wasn't running, and a sculpture was missing from one group of sculptures.

They said things like ""Our sales counter is not a workbench - don't treat it like one!"" and ""We don't lend out tools - so don't ask!"" Finally there was a several paragraph statement that basically said if you don't have the make and model of the unit you need a part for, you'll be served last.

Even in the clearance room (pretty big space in the back), items that were pretty well damaged were still priced like new.  Strange.

The staff were friendly and not overly pushy, so I guess there's that.  The pricing system was a little difficult to understand, which might be the point (forcing you to ask someone to translate the signage).  I know other folks who found things they liked and seemed ok with the price and service, so obviously it just wasn't our cup of tea."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"I arrived at this store on Feb 11th at 8:05pm. There were 9 customers and approximately 6-7 Verizon employees in the store. The doors were locked when I arrived since they close at 8pm. The manager came to the door I ask him could I come in for a quick second to put cash in the machine to pay my bill and he said "" NO we are CLOSE"". Really ??? this takes less then 5 mins, plus there are server all people still in the store. 
Wow, very poor customer service! I stayed outside in my car for 45 mins to see how long before the last person left. But, they wouldn't let me in for 5mins to pay my bill which involved NO service from any of the Verizon sales rep.

Shopping,2.5,OR,"Every time I walk into this location I wonder why the unemployment rate in this country is so low. Why? Because they never have enough employees working. 

A majority of people (sometimes including myself) know what they are looking for, but just don't know exactly where to find it when they visit a home improvement store. 

The limited staff that they do have isn't the nicest group of employees out there. When you finally do chase an employee down to ask them a question, they always respond like you're bothering them. 

The store itself is nice. It's a good size, clean, and well organized. 

Don't use the self-checkout lanes because they never work and you always end up needing assistance with them, which ends up being more of a hassle. 

Drive the extra mile to the Oldsmar location because it is well worth it."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"BEFORE YOU SHOP HERE READ THIS ASAP!!!

The store is very well put together and well stocked. The sales associates are nice so long as things go the way they should. However, they know very little about the internet presence of the company or the unbelievable amount of red tape it takes to get from one issue to another. The left does not know what the right is doing from the store level to corporate so here's my advice. Do not return anything unless you want them to have your money for weeks and weeks and then tell you all sort of stories about why this person was wrong for saying one thing and that person is wrong for saying another. I would rather see anyone go to Bryn Mawr for their specially fitted shoes."

Ten minutes later we were seated.  Shortly thereafter, another waitress came over to take our order.  However she had far too much to drink and was too hammered to get our order.  She took our order verbally.   Thirty minutes later, and no drinks, we left.  I told the hostess on the way out that we had been there for almost two hours and only had one drink.  She really didn't care.  We will never go back.   It has become too popular for them to care about their customers.  Two bad waitresses, a $10 cover charge, and mediocre cigars.   No thanks."

My friend and I went in to grab something quick-boy was I wrong and should have known better.  There was only one person checking people out and the manager came up multiple times to look up things and move clothing around but not once did she take the time to help out.  The lady that was waiting behind me must have thought it was taking too long because she put the clothes back and left!  If I want to purchase anything from A & F I will order it online!

However, customer service is definitely hit or miss. Yesterday, the girl in the paint section basically just kept doing whatever it was she was doing while I and two other customers waited to get her time. And it wasn't because she didn't notice us. She just couldn't be bothered to say, ""I'll be with you in a moment."" Who just goes about their business while 2 customers are eagerly waiting? I just feel like this shows poor lack of training in customer service. I realize she was in the middle of something, but I could have just walked away and not given Lowe's my business in the minutes I waited on her to help me."

I took a new knitter there on my last visit to buy yarn for her first project, and both of us felt like we were a real bother to the owner who never offered assistance. We ended up buying over $100.00 in yarn and paterns, but had ask and cajole for her to look up from her I pad for help. Maybe it was a bad day for her, but I will find another store.

I just happened upon this store when I was walking around aimlessly at the mall. It's located right by Saks Fifth Avenue, at the end of the mall, just chillin' innocuously, all by itself. 

My sister collects vinyl, so I pawed through their selection to try to find some sick rekkids for her. I did find quite a few, actually, and they were priced right (anywhere from $1 to $10). The selection runs the gamut from Supertramp to Leonard Cohen to Perry Como. There are records for everyone here!

Not the kind of place to go if you're looking for one specific book, because they may not have it (they don't have the LARGEST selection) but a great place to go and get inspired or buy a gift for someone. 

Notable items they sell include coffee table books, many autographed copies of books, NOLA cookbooks, a shelf of staff pics, notebooks and calendars, reading glasses, and postcards.

Prices are reasonable. The autographed books are a little pricier but range from $40-$60 but they have some big names!

He's also very friendly and willing to give you tips on how to get your bike fixed. I'd definitely come back here for any bike needs. I just went there to pick up a new pair of sunglasses. I was standing in line for about 10 minutes before someone finally gave me a half-way to the back. I was just standing there and waiting for someone to help me. They didn't have any of my size, but they were very helpful and friendly."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I've been going here since 1991. Don is awesome. His dad terrific. There is no better hardware store anywhere in this county. They are absolutely the best.

Don will get you anything he can, even if he can transport it in his car from another ace that may have just what you need. He remembers you like a friend. Period.

And when it comes to price, I always thought all aces were the same price. This place has great prices, excellent selection of products from Flora, to decorative arts, to all kinds of bulk product.

I'm here at least two times a week when it's not snowing out, and then I'm even there every other week when it is.

Check out is super fast and efficient compared to any other hardware store. And you get five dollar discounts direct from Ace from the store more than others.

Harleysville Ace is the place."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I went in to hopefully get some advise on how to paint some furniture, as well as get some good quality paint. Let me tell you... they are awesome over there. I found out some awesome knowledge about a primer that sticks to almost anything without sanding, AND bought some awesome paint. The guy was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He helped my pick out the paint I needed ad the colors I liked. Also I went back because I made a mistake on the color of paint I wanted and they helped me out in replacing it. I would highly recommend them to everyone! The are busy so just be patient. They will get to you and they are very friendly.  Don't let the busyness deter you; they will get to you and treat you well. I will go here from now on. They are Awesome."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"As someone who has owned freshwater aquariums for almost 20 years I can tell you without a doubt that this the best fish store in middle Tennessee. They have a very large selection of community fish, south American cichlids, African cichlids, and saltwater fish. 

Most of the staff is very knowledgeable. Some of the younger people that work there are not very experienced but the older guys can give you great advice... much better than the blank stares or misinformation you will most likely get at the pet store chains like petsmart.

I will admit a lot of their dry goods, supplies, and equipment can be pretty pricey but when it comes to fish their prices are very reasonable and their selection is second to none in this area.

Weekends can be quite chaotic. If you are looking to go and get advice I'd recommend going on a weekday."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"I jokingly call this place basic b**** central on the weekends. You get an insane crowd of Jersef but also totally reasonable things. It's kind of weird that I'm sifting through the racks andyites trying to get discount designer and otherwise be annoying. I'm half kidding :) 

But, on weekday evenings, this place is quiet and nice to shop at! I love that they have high end beauty products like Bliss and Stila for cheap. They also have Burberry and some really expensive stuf one thing is $500 and the next is $10. You really have to have patience to look at the clothes but I think for accessories the selection is good and it's easy to shop. 

I've seen a lot of Marc Jacobs, Kate Spade, etc. 

Lovely addition to Center City apart from Macys and it's small, but totally serves the purpose. Friendly customer service."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I drove from DC to visit this salon, more specifically-Emily. It is a beautiful space and everyone was really friendly. Emily did an amazing job and was open to my reference photos and we discussed all the elements of the cut.  I have long hair and was looking for a little layering and baby bangs. She did some precision work on my bangs, which are super short and it was the best they've looked. It's been about 6 months since I got my haircut (way longer than I like to wait but philly is far!) and it's grown out wonderfully. She did some big soft curls and didn't overwhelm my hair with product. 

I'm still shocked at how affordable it was compared to similar salons and caliber in DC. It was worth the drive and I can't say enough nice things about Emily and this salon."
Shopping,1.5,OR,I just went to what I thought was my 6pm apt. Apparently they never scheduled me like they said over the phone. There was nothing they could do to help and the woman working the front desk was horrendous. I believe her name was Marlene. She was very cold and not sincere. When I asked to speak to the General Manager she said she wasn't in and didn't know when she would be back at work. I hate being negative but this lady should find another line of work and not deal with people. It was too bad because I enjoyed Vision Works when I lived in Buffalo. I'm happy to say as soon as I left I was able to schedule an apt with America's Best tomorrow evening. Everything happens for a reason.

I finally made it to this store, instead of just browsing their website. What a beautiful location it is too! They were playing great music from Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. They have all kinds of cards, postcards, pens, calendars, wrapping paper, etc. All very high quality items. They tend to be on the pricier side though. Up the stairs and towards the back, they have an area where you can order personalized items like wedding invitations and things of that sort.

The staff seemed friendly and they have a dog that hangs out under the table to greet people too.

If I were going to splurge on some local NOLA themed stationary, this would be the place to do it!"

The blond woman at the front desk of the eye exams section was so rude.  She ""didn't think I was eligible for coverage"" and after she spoke to the doctor, she asked me to come back on Monday so I wouldn't pay out of pocket.  I would have gladly paid out of pocket today and gotten glasses.  I would have then asked my insurance for a reimbursement.  However, with her rude attitude and lack of being polite and kind, I just walked out.  I'm never coming back.

Costco has a wider selection of items I feel. The people feel more proud to work there it seems and are less grumpy. Everyone is willing to help out. This location is better than the one in Reno because A-It has a gas station, which is much cheaper than normal stations, B-Parking is better. C-Spanish Springs area is much prettier than the Plumb/Freeway area. I've already been there a handful times in the last few months since getting the card. It's made grocery shopping more fun and enjoyable. Definitely very happy with what this location has to offer."

I've taken a friend and my mom to their terrarium workshops before and they are fantastic! I highly recommend going to one. There's a wonderful selection of rocks, moss and plants for your terrarium, they explain the steps so well AND they serve some wine cheese on the side. Doesn't get better than that. If only I had more space in my place for more terrariums but for now, two is probably enough.

They are attentive and give great eye care and they always try to save me money with coupons and samples.  In today's economic climate, private medical practices are having to close left and right and sell to large hospitals where patients then get inferior continuity of care and up-charge you on services (that insurance companies are party to setting by the way) just by being part of this hospital.  It's really sad and forces many of these private practices to take on more patients than they should have to in order to offset the costs of NOT selling.

The answer is that in spite of Gary's aloof, sarcastic, and unpleasant demeanor, his store is excellent - chock full of great stones, fossils, jewelry, etc. But as an enthusiast I walk out of Gary's disappointed at not being able to engage the owner in simple conversation about his merchandise and about rock and fossil collecting generally.  I should have learned that no such conversation is possible by now, but every time I try, Gary manages to put me off, either by making me feel stupid or by making me feel that I am wasting his time.

With that said, I'm not sure if they were low stocked but this was not what I expected.  Basically they sell t-shirts and magnets.  I think I was expecting something more like Wonders on Woodland.  There were a couple of cool signs, a vespa and what not but they all seemed like a back drop.  Maybe the store is a front and it's more about having a centralized work space?

I've found some good buys here.  It is truly a thrift store, although they know when they have something good and mark it up a bit.  I don't fault them for it, but you're not going to find a Betsey Johnson for $3 next to a crappy Dress Barn dress.  Ever since they opened the top floor, it's been better because they can fit more clothes.  Downstairs there's more in the way of housewares, records, decorations, jewelry and general stuff."

I would definitely come back again. I just wish there were more employees there.Great experience. I came in to get a new pair of shoes for my son's gym. The staff was very helpful and pleasant.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"Are you still like buying my trees here in the years past, and I guess you could say they're kind of an institution in Santa Barbara County, but the prices for their trees has just gotten ridiculous. I'm actually surprised they can compete with other sellers considering that their trees are probably the most expensive around. The average 6 1/2 - 8 foot tree that most people would probably get for their living room starts at $99. Smaller 4-5ft trees start at $65.

I'm all about shopping local, but only if the vendor recognizes that we're smart shoppers. 

I ended up purchasing a lovely  8 foot  Nordman Fir tree for $55 at Home Depot. Sure it didn't spur that warm feeling one gets at Christmas tree pop-up, but driving away with that great tree on my car and more $$ in my wallet, made me realize that wasn't my fault."

When changes came about and a 7 day a week digital version was offered in conjunction with a 2 day delivery version of the paper I took that option. Now I come to find out that apparently the Digital version option has been changed and I can only view a certain amount of stories before I need to upgrade my service, sounds to me like data caps on a cell phone service plan.  Strange I never remember that being the case when I signed up for the service. I have other digital newspaper apps and haven't incurred this issue. That and the cost associated to be able to view digitally is obnoxious, $7.99 a month, when I am already paying for that service. Very unhappy with your bait and switch RGJ."

We come here to get them because we save quite a bit. One day if you have time go to Petsmart and look at a few items. Then come here, you will be shocked how much you can save.

They carry tommy bahama stuff every so often. I do love Tommy Bahama and I am always looking for a deal. The scratch and dent selection (clearance) is usually over priced for what is back there. Sometimes they have items that don't look like they would function as they supposed to only marked down a little.

During the warmer months they definitely carry a good selection of beach decor. The stock is always changing so we make it a goal to go once every two weeks."

Today I went and ordered $500 worth of deck materials for a deck rebuild in a few weeks. It seriously took me 5 minutes. The guy who helped me was super friendly and explained the delivery process. I don't have a huge truck that can lug 20' boards, so I was willing to pay to have some dude deliver.  
The store has a user-friendly layout, and I don't get as overwhelmed as I do when I go to Lowes. I love wandering around here. The garden center is quite nice as well."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"Review from a cat owner who has zero regard for dogs, fish, hamsters, jaguars, oysters and other domesticated friends:

Living in South Philly, I dont have many choices for pet food. I would love to support Doggy Style more, but they never have the big bags of Before Grain cat food that I like. They offer to order it, but really, I am there because I need cat food now, not 3 days from now. 

The Monster Pets also has a good selection of cat toys and other cat needs, such as floor cleaners and brushes.

They have a great ongoing sale on Fresh Step kitty litter. 2 huge bags for 15 bucks? Oh word! Go to Target and its 10 bucks a bag! (When they have it, that is...)

Yes, it is a depressing, sort of generally ""bad vibes"" pet store. But I can say Pet Smart does genuinely meet my kitty needs."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"I think this was one of the first (possibly THE first) IKEA to come to the Philly area, and it's massive. Just off 476, as in, it's obnoxiously close to the highway, so it's easy to find. 

Inside, it's the typical maze of half-English, half-Swedish signs and teeny tiny shortcuts.  Then you get to the furniture area, where it looks more like the lumber area of Home Depot than anything. Finally, you pay and escape back into the parking lot (or the underground garage) and breathe a sigh of relief.

The amount of product they have is staggering-- and there's a lot more than just furniture. There's kitchenware, bedding, stuffed animals, you name a furniture item at IKEA, and they're pretty much guaranteed to have four accompanying accessories for it.

Minus one star for the ridiculously intricate maze that ensures you see EVERY display, but four stars for cleanliness, stock, and amenities."

Unfortunately the animal wouldn't come out on it's own and I had to open up the drywall AND VENTS, but Jordan and Walter were there for HOURS helping me with this crazy situation. When I got the animal out, they came back and patched all the vents back together.

$5?! I would pay $25 just to get into this place. It's absolutely astounding. I have lived in Philadelphia for 12 years and can't say there's anything even remotely like this in the city. It's truly one of those gems tucked away at a corner in 10th & South. Why don't more people know about this??!

I went there with a date. She's from Jersey and I showed her all around the city including Center City, Old City, Penn's Landing, Liberty bell, National Constituion Center, etc.. Magic Gardens was the best part of the day for both of us. 

The artist himself, Isaiah Zagar, was there at the end of the block giving a mural/mozaic class to a group of people. It was pretty cool.

I don't really write reviews on here unless I feel very strongly about something. But when it comes to Magic Gardens... really, you should go."

This fall season found me in a great selection of sweaters and leggings. There is never a shortage of cute dresses, regardless of season, that will carry you from work to cocktail hour. Incidentally, I no longer live in Philadelphia, but regularly have clothes shipped to me and am always sure to stop in when I'm in town.

My only complaint is small quantities on hand due to the small space - but if she doesn't have something in stock, she will order it for the following week. I frequently get a 10-25% discount on larger plants that have been on the floor too long. Also her markup is low enough to make the convenience worth paying retail for small loads of plants (15 minute drive vs an hour+ out to the rural growers). It is also worth paying Jene's $1 or $2 more per plant over Home Depot prices because the root ball sizes are full and true to the container.

Precision initially agreed to the return, although I had to pay for return shipping to get them moving. Upon their receipt of the watch? $200 restock fee. For a watch they completely misrepresented. Restock fees with flakey buyers? I understand. Just didn't like it? Yep - Understand that too. I would charge a restocking fee also! But, you want to send me a watch 7 years older than you claimed during the sale? Mistakes happen, understood, but as a watch guy, I have to say that's a BIG mistake.

After checking in and going out to the lanes, I began shooting. After a while, a fellow shooter offered to give me some pointers, which I greatly appreciated.

In the front is the retail section; they have plenty of firearms for rental, and many new and used handguns on sale. One thing that they did not stock much of was revolvers; this seems to be a semi auto preferred place.

Shopping,2.0,OR,"I was dubious about using Colonial when I read other reviews, however, needed to move quickly on my bathroom project and had heard good things about them from my daughter who used them for her kitchen.  They were close by, convenient, and you can't beat their selection.  I worked with Rita, who was a real pro, not to mention extremely patient and helpful.  She has a great design sense and worked closely with me to make sure I was making the right choice.  I totally trusted her guidance and was not disappointed.  My template appointment was not only on time but early to arrive as was my installation!  My end result is a perfectly installed STUNNING bathroom counter top.  I could not be happier or more pleased and look forward to working with Rita to achieve the same results in my two other bathrooms that desperately need remodeling."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"Our future son in law's bridal party was spread out all over the country so he thought it best to use The Black Tux, an online tux supplier. The tux my husband received was horrible and was too tight. They sent the next size and it was huge. At that point we decided to cut our losses and just go to Rochester where we received not only excellent service but a beautiful tux which fit perfectly. 
The next day my son arrived with his tux (from the Black Tux), it was the day before our daughter's wedding and we noticed his pants had a big rip in them. Back we went to Rochester, and luckily they had the same style tux so he was still able to match the bridal party.
I can't recommend Rochester enough! Not only do they have the latest styles in formal wear with a huge selection, they are also great people!!"

My husband spoke to the manager at Geerlings and they said the ""distributor"" will not do anything about our purchase.     We spent $200 on this and did everything they said to do when we first bought it (primed it, laid sand in the bottom, etc...) and they will not reimburse us or allow it to be exchanged.   I hate posting things like this, but wish I would have known what poor customer service they have prior to our purchase.    It's sad to think that if we purchased this from Amazon, they would have a better return policy than this ""local"" business.  The picture I added is the day we bought it vs 3 months later...."

I have flowers delivered to people that mean a lot to me personally and to the business I am in. As a busy man, I don't have time to research the perfect arrangement for a retiring business owner or to send condolensces to a good friend and business partner. I give Irene the reason for the flowers and she nails the PERFECT arrangement. I know this because I call the people she delivers too. They are almost breathless. This sends our friends and customers the message that we were not only thinking about them, but really do care. Her and the staff there have the most pleasant disposition and do this work like it was their calling. I am not using anyone ever. Don't retire Irene, I will need you."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"This place is great if your looking for cheap things. They don't just have a bunch of cloths here. You can also find shoes, toys, and a bunch of home and kitchen stuff. Lots of things here are brand name and I'm always surprised by the deals that can be found here. Sometimes ill find the original tag still on some of the items, and they are usually twice as much as the Ross tag, now thats a deal. 
The lies are a bit small and stuffed, but i guess they have a large inventory to get out. I gave this place a 4 and not a 3 because it feels cleaner than other Ross's and it doesn't have that weird thrift shop feel like some other places do. 
All in all, don't be afraid to take a gander over here. Think of it as a store where its always black Friday...for the most part."

The woman in the fitting rooms was very friendly . I had a question about my Banana Republic rewards and she was able to answer easily and was very helpful.   Checkout was also a breeze and the cashier informed me that I can get my rewards texted to me! I must've been living under a rock. I had no idea.

What I was so impressed by was the service. They two women working walked that thin line between helpful and giving you space to explore. 

We knew what we wanted and the sales person could have easily said, here it is. Thanks for the money. But instead, she walked us through the features. They told us some tips about the car seat.  She encouraged me to push the stroller around a bit. 

I don't enjoy shopping for anything really but this was nice. The store was clean, organized and had parking. The ZukaBaby team was professional and helpful. I would definitely use these guys again."

In brief, the intro class starts with safety, studio description, glassblowing background, then you get a few expert demos,  and voila...you're handling a ball of liquid fire and making it look good.  Hours melt away quickly and a handful of laughs and jokes later, you've got a creation to be proud of.  In fact, whether you've got dexterity or not, you're sure to make something beautiful, especially with the help of very competent and friendly staff.

The first time was in 2015 when I called for an AC inspection. They guy who came was really nice and immediately found an issue with a clogged drain pipe. I was acutely aware of this issue prior to calling for the appointment and never mentioned it. It was awesome when he finished and just mentioned it, no extra charge, already fixed it.

The second time was this year (2017), where again they found an issue before it manifested into a whole undertaking. If I had to guess how much money they saved me from these inspections, I would put it in the thousands. Also, the tech was really personable and gave me all the information I needed and also answered a whole list of questions I had.

So the pieces on display in the gallery rotate very frequently. They also often loan out some of their works to other museums and they have a strong partnership with the Phoenix Art Museum and a permanent gallery there as well.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"This place has the friendliest, most helpful staff!  If Staples isn't the first place you think of for wedding stuff (it wasn't mine either), you should seriously check them out.  We are DIYing our wedding programs and Staples had an excellent selection of cardstock and the copy center will cut them in half for you really cheap.  It's a little more expensive to get them cut evenly (it takes longer and is on a more precision machine), which we didn't realize the first time we went.  When we noticed the half sheets weren't all the same size, we took them back.  They let us return them and offered to cut us even ones free of charge, since they hadn't told us they would come out uneven on the other machine the first time.  They also helped us figure out the logistics of putting together the rest of the program, based on our ideas."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I recently had a wonderful experience with Papier Plume that warranted a yelp review.

I was given a pen by a friend whose father is a pen manufacturer. The fountain pen that I received was somehow dysfunctional, but I didn't want to call my friend and complain... as it was a generous gift and I didn't want to appear unappreciative. 

I went over to Papier Plume, (which admittedly my family has purchased many things from) and informed them of the issue with the pen. They spent a solid week tracking down the necessary parts and emailed and called me with updates. I was extremely impressed with their professionalism. This is the kind of service that you find where people really care about their product and service.

I was a fan of this place before, but now I would refer anyone I know to their little gem of a shop.

If you have a pen need or problem, give these guys a call."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I have been going here for awhile now and its great. I use to go to Philly Archery and Gun Club and Double Action but now I go to DVSC. The range at Philly Archery and Gun Club was far too cramped plus at nights the area gets a little sketchy and parking can be a pain. Double Action is find but the selection I think is limited and its not as much of a welcoming environment though I do like the place. DVSC on the other hand, everyone who works there will spend as much time with you answering all of your questions, telling stories, helping you out, and most importantly, giving you great deals! I wasn't planning on it, but I ended up selling my pistol and moving up to the gun of my dreams for years, because the deal was so good. The staff is excellent and the range is great and has lots of space."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"First, we did find a decent deal here. But compared to the service, it's not worth the minimal savings. We ordered 2 mattresses 13 days ago and they are still not available. I have called a few times, but the phone just rings forever with no answer. I finally went down to the store last night (day 12) to see what was going on and all I could get was: ""The truck will be here sometime this week"". No day specified, no apologies, nothing. Terrible customer service and because of these issues we are never coming back here again to purchase mattresses. I wanted to shop local but this is absolutely ridiculous. They have alot of my money and I have nothing to show for it, not even a day of when I can pick my mattresses up. Here's the kicker, the 'truck' is only coming from Washington!!! Go elsewhere, you can get similar deals and much better service."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"For the price I paid, I was hoping we'd be able to mix our own scents or that the process would be a little more creative/involved. You basically go in, pick a vessel and one of their pre-made scents, and pour. The associates don't really go into any detail about how the scents are made or give you any insight into their case making process (maybe some info about the history of the company, the manufacturing process then vs now?). Overall, this is nice if you have your heart set on a particular Paddywax scent but didn't like the container it came in. 

I get that's all up to corporate though, and I will say that the customer service was really great! My friend and I missed our appointment because we went to the wrong location, and the ladies on the phone were able to switch our reservation last minute. They were also super helpful during the process itself."

I called back and asked if there was anything they could do to help me out.  He said that they would not be able to do anything to help me, and that he would call me back.  I asked if he could call me back to say that there was nothing they could do.  He said no, they had no record of the call, and I would have to call the store to see if it was ok."

I asked if I could get a replacement and they said it would be $35. I said I'm not sure if I would be able to get it back. They said it would be $60.

I was in there with my mother and my aunt on a Saturday afternoon. They said they'd have it for me on Monday. I drove around the block, picked it up, put it in my car and it was delivered today.

I would not recommend this place.  I went there to get my hair cut and they didn't have a good selection of hair cutters.  I asked for the manager.  He said he had no idea why I was looking for a haircut and he couldn't help me.  I left.  I went back and they had some other cutters.  The manager told me he would only give me a $5 tip."

Due to COVID-19, you will have to get your temperature checked through the double doors to the left of the entrance. Other than that, I was very well pleased with the level of professionalism displayed - when I arrived, the gentleman greeted me and told me he would be with me in a short moment. The price may seem a little steep when comparing to other providers but I'm a strong believer in that you get what you pay for. My phone was repaired in less than 30 minutes. Almost two months later and I haven't had any issues with my new screen. I will say the screen protector I chose, the premium option, was a bit on the cheaper side and didn't last me a month before it began chipping away and eventually cracked."

I downloaded the screen home button but it was driving me crazy to use it like that so I looked online at FoxPaw and saw that they could fix it. I live near the Webster Groves location so I brought it in there instead of using a drop station. The woman at the reception area was very friendly and polite. She made sure that they had a home button in stock and then quoted me the price. In about 2.5 hours it was completed and I was able to drop by and pick it up. It was a little pricey - I mean, cheaper than a new ipad but still quite an investment. The ipad is working well and I have no complaints with the work that they did."

I called this morning 7/31 and not only sat on hold for 15, but the women in the framing department who answered the phone was extremely rude, and the tone in her voice was very condescending. I asked her if it would be done by noon today, and She told me that they did not even start the matting yet, and that I might be able to get the picture back today but probably not. We are having a party this weekend and needed the picture back yesterday otherwise we would have went somewhere else. Especially if we would have known that they do not honor their delivery dates for goods. 

Further more, we would never recommend Michael's for any goods or services."

The customer service is horrendous, in that you have to help yourself and if you have a specific dress you are looking for, you have to find it yourself.  When you ask the employees a question, they are rude.  Make sure you take your own measurements before you get there.  The staff member that measured my daughter did not measure correctly and we ended up with a dress 2 sizes too big for $500. I contacted company headquarters and their service is even worse, they never got back to me.  Also, there are no refunds, even due to the fact that their staff is either improperly trained or just don't want to be bothered.  Go someplace else, this store is a waste of time and money!"

I do miss the days when you could get a nice Wolverine for 6.99 instead of the 18 dollars they cost today.

Truth be told I have recently given up the comic book habit. It was cheaper to start collecting wine as comic books prices are about 4 dollars a book. I was spending about 30 bucks a week (don't tell the wife, she thinks it was only about 10). Nowadays if I want to read a particular story line I will go the graphic novel route.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I called this place and spoke with Stanley himself about estate or antique engagement rings. First, I happened to call him during his lunch hour and, though the salesperson patched me through, he asked me to call back in 20 minutes as he was eating. Even though this seemed somewhat rude (I mean, he's eating in his office, after all, just hold off for 5 minutes), I did call him back. I then explained what I was looking for and he said he didn't know offhand, but would check his inventory and call me back by Friday (in two days). This all took about 5 minutes, which again made it seem quite rude that he had not simply answered my questions before instead of asking me to call back. So I provided my number and name, but he never called back! I was in Metairie this weekend, but didn't bother going in. Why patronize a place with such a rude owner!?!"
Shopping,3.5,OR,"You can look at this place as an REI that's cheaper, but with worse selection, or an online store where you can try stuff on before buying, but with worse selection. If those are your expectations, this place is great! The clearance rack has things that are discounted by 50% to 80%. Compare that to a normal outdoor goods store, where the clearance rack will have things that are 20%-30% off!

The selection isn't as good as at the Utah STP or the Denver STP, but they have way more stuff on clearance here than at either of those other locations.

People are complaining that the prices used to be better (perhaps true) and that the selection isn't as good as online (obviously true because you can buy online from a giant warehouse plus multiple store locations and this is just one store), but this is still as good as it gets if you want to try on some deeply discounted outdoor clothing."

It was very expensive, supposedly because of the jewelery. regardless, their experience and knowledge was worth it to me. Long story short I wasn't happy with my piercing, It was off just a tad bit to the point that I felt EVERYONE could notice but realistically probably would never until I pointed it out. Usually I'd feel too bad to say something but did this time. I think it was Jessica I had take it out. She didn't make me feel bad or guilty about it at all. Which is nice. Another cool thing, not that waiting a half hour was awesome but she wanted to make sure the tool she needed was extra clean so it took a minute. I'm still waiting to heal a little longer to go in and have it redone."

He had a swanky website to note every music preference you might have in great detail (particular songs/genres for different events, specific timeframes and versions of the songs, etc). He made us feel at-ease knowing our music would be exactly the way we wanted, and he delivered on that. Justin even rented us out a mini microphone/speaker to use the night before the event, which saved us a big headache. As far as music selection during the dance portion, he kept things varied but still incorporated most of our requested songs. He had just the right mix of original versions of songs with dance/electronic versions, and he kept the crowd energized all night. Many guests of all ages and persuasions came up to us during the reception to tell us how amazing the DJ was."

The prices were good, considering the full prices were much more! I love the fun   style and shape of their frames and different lens color options.

It's obvious the tech who repaired my screen knew they messed up the home button and enabled the virtual instead of fixing the issue they created. This company lacks integrity and this experience has been awful. I now have to get a new phone when the only thing broken when I dropped my phone off was the screen."

They have a fair amount of your usual trading cards, dice for tabletop games, vintage video games and consoles, anime, manga, and board games as well. Seeing as they are still new, I'm sure that collection will grow and I'm looking forward to that as the selection today was... modest. The folks running the place were friendly but seemed very overwhelmed by the amount of customers who were lining up at the register but, again, they are new so I'm sure this will pass with time. I do worry that the proximity this store has to the other two far more established dens of geekdom here in Reno will hurt its business but there's room for everyone in my book.

Shopping,3.0,OR,"The Christmas Light Show in the Grand Court of Macy's is a total Philadelphia holiday tradition! For years of course this was the famous John Wanamaker's Department Store which started this tradition of a light and sound show with thousands of lights dancing high above the Grand Court.  And to add to the festivities, before and at the end of the show the Wanamaker Organ - the world's largest with almost 30,000 pipes - plays Christmas carols.  This show is of course pre-computer era and all it's special effects.  Not to worry - it still delights in its retro-way like perhaps a breathtaking computerized special effects and laser program might not do. I think it may be the best free Christmas show in the world.  And so often do the thousands of shoppers and visitors who pack the Grand Court several times a day during the Christmas season to see and hear the Christmas Light Show majestically unfold above them!"

Her taste in jewelry is unique and not a mass produced looking item in the house. My husband got an Alishan wedding band and I have an eternity motif band. She told me the story of the jewelers and we loved the extra touch. One ring was $700 and one was $2k, I ultimately loved both and chose the latter but she didn't push me toward one or the other. She sees how unique the persons taste is and wants you to love your piece because you love it. For a wonderful time of play and sparkle, artisan and care see 33!"
Shopping,5.0,OR,"A story about the Pedego family. After ankle and knee replacement I was sold on the ebikes. My research narrowed it down to one, the Pedego Classic Interceptor. Living in Pennsylvania I wandered over to Pedego Sourland bikes in NJ to look at a demo they had for sale. Unfortunately neon orange was too bright for me so I ordered a new one from them. Again a disappointment when I found out that they discontinued the Sandstone color that I wanted. Sourland searched the family and came up empty. I lucked out with a call to Pedego La Quinta. Dave reached out to Josh at the Pedego Carmel store and he had one in stock. Josh even went the extra mile in robbing the mag wheels and brown balloon tire package from another bike, added the large capacity battery and shipped me the bike all for less than the retail price. From NJ to California to Indiana, the Pedego family is alive."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"Wow, that three star is mean. Not the stars but the comments. I bought a great little watercolor for a friend. At $21 it was an excellent deal and very pretty. They had some nice jewelry and cute clothes. Thematically, the store is going for the new, curious home farmer type, and yes, the store is geared for the bourgeoise who may be new to pickling, gardening, baking - etc. But let's get real, for the area, the store offers perfectly sweet introductions to things that may become hobbies, or passions. It is like a store that creates introductions to questions in your mind about earthy pleasures you may have forgotten to ask about. 

For the hobbyist, this is perfect- for the passionate, they will find their own way eventually. For a gift item, it is a good bet you'll find a nice kitschy cookbook or trinket. I like it. In fact I love this little store- even though my kid doesn't play soccer."

However, our waiting got us nowhere. The cops shut down the place for being at capacity and having cars lined up the road. We were told that we could not attend Sunday and would have to come back another weekend.

Couple of issues:
1) That's the only weekend my friends and I could go together.
2) What's going to stop this from happening the next time we go?

This venue has no control over how many people are able to buy tickets to their farm. They are overselling tickets and don't seem to care.

When we all went to ask about refunds on social media, the farm simply deleted the original post and any comment that was made on other posts. They are also ignoring emails and phone calls.

Bobby and Stewart handled my situation with care and love and you can tell that they genuinely enjoy helping people.

I love that this store is organized by color options. It is a very simple way to find things. I often decide on the color of jewelery that I need when I am looking for a new piece. I also like that everything is laid out, and there is often only one set per item. It makes it feel as if what I am buying is one of a kind. (I am sure they have other sets in the back.. so no need to fight over an item ladies!)

This place has more than just earring and necklaces too. It has some funky favorites as well: cool bags, knick knack things etc.

Jaime matched my color and cut/styled my hair! She highlighted and cut/styled my sister in law's hair and we were both extremely happy with our hair.

Additionally, the woman giving me my massage was hardly relaxing, though she was very sweet.  She talked the entire time about herself and her anxieties, which put me on edge.  It's perhaps my fault because I could have asked her to quiet down, but I felt like she needed someone to listen to her.  She also stopped numerous times to use Siri to Google standing desks and other healthier desk options for me -while this was sweet, I did not want to waste precious massage time for this.

The decor is classy and the food court boasts many different types of food.  If you want more formal dining there are a variety of places on the north side out facing Broadway, or to the south, and east against Wilmot.

Sadly, like many malls now, there are no more music stores, but the theatre is a nice addition.  On a hot summer day you really could stay cool and dry all day here during monsoon season.

Parking can be harry, especially during the holiday season.  Best bet if you want stress free parking...just go to the far east side of the mall between it and Wilmot and use the auxiliary parking.  You'll have to walk further, but it bets the stress of driving around any day of the week to me."

I think some items are pricey but what isn't nowadays! However my top I found was $35, it would cost $89 at BeBe's and my skirt was $75, which would have been $95 at BeBe's (using BeBe's as an example). I think their prices are about comparable with all clothing stores.

The rooms are designed to be shared so you don't have to go into the main store to find a particular size. This mall is so large that you would think it would be a lot bigger. It is a great place to walk around and check out. I just went there to see if there was anything else I could do. I was so excited to find out that there is a coffee shop inside. I love that they have a coffee shop in the main store so if you are in the area you can try it out. The Starbucks is on the second floor and they have a coffee bar. I loved that they had a Starbucks bar for the entire store. I also love that the coffee bars have

I had to call the owner to come out and get the phone number, but I was told it would be $100 for a service call, and that it would take another month for the repair.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"A great find just minutes from Mt. Rose.  The unassuming presence of the shop wouldn't lead one to expect much.  However, we were drawn in by the large hand painted sign in front advertising equipment rentals for $20.  Knowing that Mt. Rose was closer to $50 for the same package, we gave it a shot.  What a pleasant surprise.  The owner helped us immediately and set us up with this season's skis and boots.  Almost brand new Rossi's and Lange boots.  Great gear.  Along with this, he hot waxed both the rental skis and our personal skis for free with a hot waxing machine he invented and built by himself.   Returning the gear took all of 3 minutes on our way back down the hill from Rose.   Couldn't have asked for a better rental experience.  Highly recommend this overlooked little gem.  Top of the mountain shop, top of the mountain service at great prices."

I came in looking for a vintage dress and I had a couple of styles that I knew I didn't want. I met with Amber and I tried on multiple dresses including a style I thought I didn't want. I ended up falling in love with how I looked in a strapless dress, (which was one of the styles I thought I didn't want) Amber did an amazing job helping me with accessories. She really made my experience at David's Bridal 5 stars. She told me the tradition of veils and it was very heart warming as well as doing my hair in a cute little up-do. My best friend and I were very emotional through the experience. Amber and David's Bridal exceeded my expectations. Thank you so very much!!! I can't wait to show it all off on my wedding day!"

We go to Forever 21 a lot!  They have slutty, one time wear, party clothes for crazy low prices.  We walk out there all them time with like 10 or 15 really cool new threads for under $100.  I love Forever 21.

But, so often these stores are a mess.  Clothes on the floor, Food and drinks left behind by tacky inconsiderate customers, careless employees, not enough employees - these stores always seem to be under-managed.  This store was not like that.  And they had people helping out on the floor!  This was a first!  And everyone who worked there was so nice.  

Soak this store up while it is still hear.  Forever 21 corporate is in trouble financially and they will all be gone soon, so get out and get your Forever 21 freak on now while you still can!"
Shopping,5.0,OR,"My husband and I took our first trip to the sponge docks and saw Lori's. We went in and I knew it was the kind of place I would want to stay for a while. Since it was a Sunday afternoon it was pretty packed. After about five minutes my husband said he would wait outside since the fragrance in the store is pretty strong.

There are tons of different soaps and lots of options to choose from. I ended up getting a gift pack type of thing with 4 soaps and a sponge inside for $14.95. I loved the almond scent and found one that had the almond and a few others to try. If my husband weren't waiting outside I would have spent a lot more time browsing. I love the soaps with the attached sponges and definitely want to try one of those next time. I will definitely be back, maybe on a weekday so I can talk to the owner and see what she recommends."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I'm a big fan of the INDIEana Handicraft Exchange, much moreso than the Art Fair nearby. The organizers curate a good variety of vendors and price-points. There are good food trucks and bands, and it is one of my favorite Indianapolis events. The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is the fact that it is not the easiest to navigate, as there are booths both outside and inside, on the front of the building and in the back parking lot. Previous years have had the indoor booths in different rooms, so you can't even make assumptions about where the vendors are from previous experience. Long story short, it is possible to miss a lot of the vendors. This could be remedied by having signs indicating that there are vendors in other places, having a free map available, or by putting the vendors all together (for instance, reorganizing things to be more in the parking lot - like, a band there instead of two bands out front)."

You can see the presses that they use to make their signature prints and there are some really cool ones they've been commissioned to do- posters for Adult Swim and CNN's coverage of the debates (complete with ink portraits of Cambell Brown and Anderson Cooper) come to mind. It's a tiny little place that's fun to stop in when you're around the Broadway area. It only takes, like, 30 minutes tops to see this place. I really liked the ""One of a kind"" postcards you can buy where they just sortof let loose on cardboard with whatever was lying around in the printing press. The staff were really friendly too, they let me flip through their wedding invitations book, explained any of the posters we asked about, and looked up things they didn't know."

Decided to try this place and are sorely disappointed we did. Wish we could go back and demand our money back. As soon as we got the tree home, we put a fresh cut on it, popped it into the stand, and watered it. By the next morning, the needles were already drying and falling off. Guy ""running"" the place was an older, heavy set white guy. Hard sell started right away and he started ordering around the hired help, a group of very hard working black guys, like they were slave labor. ""Cut that one open! Stand this one up! Move this one over here!"" Extremely rude and condescending. We should have left at that point feeling incredibly uncomfortable. Will never visit again or recommend to anyone. We got a better tree from the lot at the local high school."

I love this Habig's location simply for the beautiful display of flowers and plants that grace its 86th street frontage every season. Plus, the little english cottage building that houses the gifts and where they take your payment just makes me want to stop and buy posies!

Yet, here's what I love best about this place: the half-hour plus that two different staffers devoted to talking with us and helping us make our selections on our two visits. (This is the part of my review when I hate that I didn't get names). I have never felt rushed or ignored here, despite one of those two aforementioned trips being very near closing time. Lots of places of plants, lots of places have really nice plants, but you just can't beat excellent service that goes beyond ""making the sale."" 

Bottom line: I like shopping here so much that I would pass up a cheaper shop in favor of the treatment I get here."

I looked hot!  The staff are very knowledgeable and you can tell that they love their job.  Something I really like about MAC is their recycling program.  If you have enough empty containers (from their makeup) and you bring them back into the store, you get something free!  That's a great incentive (especially because MAC isn't what I would call cheap).  
They have great quality products - not just their makeup, but their brushes are fantastic!

Annual 2 packs were $.84, 4-inch pots mostly $3.29, and prices went up from there. Slightly more expensive than large chains like Walmart, but well worth it for the selection and service! 

Creekside's greatest feature is their hanging baskets! Overflowing, they are hanging from every possible place. They also have pre-arranged pots which would make a great gift or give you ideas on how to arrange new plants in a pot or window box!

Worked with Ernie at Dorado Stone and, after a brief meeting at the tile store prior to my visit to their yard, he had already narrowed down my choices to four pieces that were, frankly, so knock-out gorgeous that I had trouble selecting.  Purchased a remnant, so the price is reasonable and I was treated like a rock star client, even for such a small job!  That's the kind of customer service other companies should emulate.  The stone is so beautiful that I feel like I am bringing a piece of artwork into my home.  I am sure that everything will continue to be exceptional with the service and quality as we move into installation.

Regards to your drop off time and pickup, Your machine was serviced VERY fast for warranty work, normally it takes 3 weeks.

This is not what I'm accustomed to when shopping at Nordstrom. She informed me that she didn't work for Nordstrom. I will never enter a Saks store again. Nordstrom knows customer service.

Shopping,1.5,OR,"As a follow up to my review on July 7, I want you to know that these idiots lied to the Better Business Bureau and said that we were told to pack our valuable items ourselves. They never said anything.

They ruined a lot more then what we claimed - some of which were sentimental items and they which they didn't care for.  We requested a refund of $1000.00 which they said we could not get.  The value of what they ruined was about $1000 but we claimed only $450. They told us that they would pay us $4.60.  Mind you, I had $200 worth of prescription medication eye drops which I actually had to throw away because they needed to be refrigerated.  They wanted to pay us 60 cents for all the medicines.  $1.00 for the Chinese vase, $1.00 each for all the other items I claimed they ruined. 

This company does not care about the customers and I would never recommend them to my worst enemy."

Shopping,5.0,OR,"I had the most amazing experience at The Alteration Shoppe. The team is friendly, dedicated, and talented. The owner met me at arrival to my first fitting and could not have been more warm and welcoming. My seamstress Estrella was FANTASTIC. I am one of those brides who took forever to pick her dress, and I didn't love it going into my alterations. I bought my dress out of state, and was really worried about taking it to a ""random"" alteration studio. Now, it feels like it was made for me. Estrella was tireless in her attention to detail and getting the bust just right. These gals are fantastic and made me feel so special from my first visit to my last! I also felt the pricing was commensurate with the service. 

I won't have the chance to wear my dress for a while due to the coronavirus pandemic, so if any additional alterations are needed in a year or two, I know just where I'm heading. Thank you gals so much!"

Just had two more piercings done by Jessica a daith and tragus piercing.  Love them both. Love all my piercings. Jessica is very good at what she does. Highly recommend Black Hole for all piercing needs. 

So now a year later I finally switched out all of my original jewelry to some beautiful gold pieces that I absolutely love. Derek switched them out for me-6 piercings. Derek is so awesome and soon to be moving on. I will miss him-although my daughter and  I may sneak in a few more piercings before he leaves. Still love Black Hole and recommend it highly.

When the next clerk asked if I needed help, I was tired of just looking around and needed to get to business. He steered me exactly where I needed to be, and it was on the opposite side of the store! Good directions!

Once I gathered my purchases, I got in the checkout line, and another clerk called for me to come to her line -- which was nonexistent. She was so cheerful and talkative! It was a good thing!

It took about 8 weeks to get a new one and they delivered a completely different bed. Over the course of the next 3 months, we had 7 different delivery appointments due to them messing up the order every single time. Each time, we had to take time off work to be there for the delivery. I called to talk to the ""manager"" and she was not helpful at all.

Today (there were probably 4 customers in the store in total) I asked someone I'm not used to applying foundation, since I've only used BB Cream. While she was informative, she spent a total of 10 seconds explaining it, gave a sample, and and went back to merchandizing. 

In the same visit I asked another associate about their lip scrubs. She seemed annoyed and gave a very short, sloppy demonstration.

I went to this place with two friends today just to buy some cheap t-shirts. We spent maybe 20 minutes looking and shopping/checking out. About 15 minutes into it I looked down at my right arm and saw a series of about 7 bites going up it. I said to my friend ""Shit, something must have gotten on me and bitten me."" I just figured, you know, bad luck for me.

Then five minutes later in the car one of my friends said ""Uh, something has got me too,"" and showed me bites going up her arm to her neck.

We all rushed back to my house and everyone threw their clothes and the things we bought into the wash, and I gave my friends some of my shorts and t-shirts. Then we went out and shampooed the upholstery of my friend's car.

There's nothing to explain these bites other than bed bugs, and if there are bed bugs in both the men's and women's section, that means they are running rampant throughout the store.

After two hours of shooting and trying multiple guns, we finally had to stop because they were closing. The staff was great and allowed us to try anything we wanted, while offering advice and/or instructions to help our son in his decisions. We shot everything (22 cal.) from rifles, to revolvers, to semi-automatic handguns, and found the pricing for the range time, gun rentals and ammo to be well priced, compared to similar ranges.

Some were of me and my son and some were him alone. She took about 15-20 poses in one room and took us to another room with different background selections for another 10-12 poses. 

I was very pleased with the photo selections I had, it was hard to chose which to buy! We will definitely be returning here for our holiday pics."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"Let me start off I love Lululemon, probably consists of 50% of my everyday wear.... They have an amazing product that they stand by. Which is not common in this age of cheap disposable clothing. I definitely prefer to spend money on something that will last. I do most of my shopping on their website... 

But on occasion I want an item sooner or want to see a new product. The staff is just rude and unfriendly at this location, maybe because I'm a 30 something with kids. Idk. I have been in this location maybe 10 times and it's always the same. If I have questions, they seem like I'm not worth their time. 

I have been to several other locations and it's completely different. Staff is overly friendly, extremely helpful (but not so much they crowd you) so I'm very disappointed that my location is not the same atmosphere. I went in last week and I think it'll be my last, I don't need to be treated that way. Hopefully something changes in the future."
Shopping,1.5,OR,"The worst service ever. I started with them for oxygen supplies in July 2015.  I got a concentrator and not one person ever follow up or service the machine.  I order ed supplies, that I waited weeks for, when I call office they had no idea the driver never showed up and said they don't have a system that lets them know whether the f\driver goes or not.  I actually signed for the concentrator and never on  7 months signed for anything else, it was dropped at my front door.  Never received any patient education on any equipment. After getting sick 3 times on 7 weeks, I checked the machine and found it had a filter that was covered in mildew and mold. I spent 3 days in the hospital with a COPD episode and treated for mold exposure.
They are the worst company, even though you are on hold for ten minutes listening to all the things their employees are trained in.  I did not see one thing on 7 months."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"We had a great experience at Mattress Land and ended up getting a fantastic deal on a new Tempur-pedic. We pretty much knew what we wanted when we walked into Mattress Land, but Joe Pittman helped answer additional questions and provided suggestions beyond what we were considering. When they didn't have the particular version of the mattress we wanted to try, he sent us down to Carson City and his colleague Dante to try it out in person. Within minutes we knew it was the mattress for us so went back up to Joe and purchased it without hesitation. Sure, we could have spent weeks hopping from various mattress stores searching for the best deal but we knew Joe was giving us a good deal and it was worth it to just close the sale out and get our new mattress. 

Several months later and we are still beyond pleased with our purchase and experience at Mattressland! If you're in the market for a new mattress, be sure to check this place out and ask for Joe."

Literally the first time I reclined the seat it stopped working. That might not have bothered me so much if it was the round about phone calls. You call the store number and it loops constantly! Right when I got to a point we're I was waiting on service, it looped the call to the top menu. Tried for 30 mins. Never will I buy or recommend her again, I was duped. Finally getting a hold of a rep using a world wide number, she was rude, expressed that sometimes stuff happens and that there is no return policy. Bobs discount has nothing to do with discounted price, it's discount service and support

I had an eye exam here, and they said the doctor was in a wheelchair and that it was okay to drive in. I was told it was ok and that I would have to wait for a technician to come to the office. I had to wait on the wait for him to come and my glasses were ready for me. I asked if they could take a picture of the glasses before they were ready, and he said they would, but they couldn't. I was just in a wheelchair and it was a long time. They didn't have the prescription I needed to get the glasses, so I asked if they could take the picture of my glasses before they were ready.

Shopping,5.0,OR,"Very honored to be one of the lucky few to experience a preview of the Sunday Brunch. I love the idea of Brunch commingled with art and history.  Red Door No 5 is an old fire station now turned into an event space and now will be open to the public for Sunday Brunch from 11-2 I believe. 

The ambience was cozy and comfortable which made me feel as if I was in the comfort of my own home entertaining my guest but instead I was the guest. It was a very small group conversing at the dinner table in a large room surrounded with art most made the owner Dominque. 

The food previewed was absolutely yum yum 99 delicious. The chief is known to have cooked for celebrities just Christy Alley and the Bucs. My favorite was the spicy Caribbean bread pudding...I can still taste it, was so good. 

The owner Dominque and his team were amazing hosts and like to them for sharing this experience with me. I'm looking forward to visiting for brunch again."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I'm not afraid to admit, that I can be a severe geek.  That I have and will forever love anime.  The idea of this store isn't what it used to be when I remember it in my middle school days.  They used to sell mangas and I remember them having a little bit more personality.  It appears they sell some imported toys and novelties, modified board games etc.  It is also fair to say, they still hold some serious ""magic"" tournaments which is cool.  Funny story, I told the clerk that I have a couple of buddies who have gotten back into ""Magic the gathering"", and that it is getting trendy.  He seemed offended. LOL!  ""I dont know about your friends, but The Gathering has always been hip!"" he exclaimed. I don't know, I just thought it was funny.... The items here are pretty expensive, but I'd say it is nice to have a b&m to go to and look at items instead of buying import toys and games online."

I found the sales experience with Randy excellent as he is very knowledgeable and explained the benefits of the different bike geometries and wheel sizes.  While other bicycle shops only tried to sell me what they had in the store or steer me to bikes that I obviously wasn't comfortable in or wouldn't offer  a reduced price even though the manufacturer had already discounted the price (because of the end of the year), College Cyclery was straight forward, willing to order the model I needed and passed along the discount.  Very easy and flexible to work with.  But the best was yet to come....an hour long fitting to make sure everything was exactly where I wanted it!

She also made sure to let me know that they offered Veteran's and Military a discount. I work Field Service, so I told her I totally understood the rescheduling. Mitch was the Locksmith that showed up on his way home at the end of the second-day. Very courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. He had everything completed in under ten-minutes.

I don't have very many items from the store because I usually feel like their patterns are ugly and not my style, however, they brought out their entire inventory. You can find clothes from any season from bikinis to winter coats and the variety is amazing. I know that I had a huge armful of stuff to try on. This is where things went slightly south. The dressing room on the first level of the store was closed and the line for the second floor dressing room was about ten people deep. The workers were extremely helpful and actually did a good job of managing the crowd making sure that people didn't take too long. The entire store is a mess, which is expected from the sheer volume of people. Everything is less than ten dollars so you can't lose here. I would definitely recommend coming here before it closes!"

Recently, we bought a new house and we scheduled another in home appointment with their specialist. We thought we'd give them a second chance. Alex was forty five minutes late, but he talked us into having him measure our counters and he said he'd put together a quote by the end of the next day. 

He never called and when we did reach him, he kept saying that it would be the following day. This went on for two weeks. Finally, we reached him and he said he would email the quote and call us in 5 minutes. Because of this runaround, I confirmed that he would be calling us, but that was two months ago and we've never heard back. 

Maybe they have more business than they can handle, but it's just poor customer service. This guy should be fired!"
Shopping,2.0,OR,"I recently had my double stroller stolen from me. I was calling around for a cheap replacement and found out that this store was selling my stolen stroller. I got the police department involved and after much hassle I have it back. Meanwhile the stores owner had called me and was extremely rude. He expected me to buy it back from him for the same price he had paid the thief. 

Though the owner refused any wrong doing I think this business was either extremely negligent and failed to do due diligence to establish ownership before buying a very high end item. Or they didn't care that it was stolen. 

Bottom line, be careful buying your strollers from a place like this that does not screen their sellers in ANY way. Strollers come with serial numbers and are registered. When the real owner shows up you will have to give it up regardless of where or who you got it from. 

And after the experience I had with the owner good luck getting your money back from this business."

To enter, you'll walk to the front of the building (on Florida Ave) and ring the doorbell and someone will greet you. Masks are required as well.

I've been here 3 times so far and Ashley always does a fantastic job threading my eyebrows. My brows always look amazing and she takes the time to educate me, provide recommendations, and even fill in and style my brows. Ashley offers other services as well, including waxing. There are also several other services offered in the same building with different ladies, from facials, lashes, and even training.

They offer online booking for appointments and you can pay and tip in advance, so you don't have to worry about it once you get there. I highly recommend Ashley for your threading and waxing needs."

When she combed out my hair with the conditioner in it, so much of my hair was pulled out because of her poor technique. The blow drying process was torturous. I was close to telling her to hand over the dryer so that I could just do it myself. My head is sore from her rough tug through my hair over and over and my hair still looks like I just waved a dryer over top of it. The stylist had to completely blowdry my hair again before styling.

Fast forward to March. The new owner, Kevin, was so sweet and agreed to look at my stuff the day after I called. I admittedly thought I got a little short changed ($50 store credit for about 8 pieces), but I understand he's running a business and I feel like his prices are fairly reasonable. The store is merchandised so well and the men's section in the back is wicked awesome.

What's really cool is that they offer something called "" wish boxes"".  You take your kiddo to the store, and they are given a cool box.

There was no one around to help me, and the doctor seemed to be in the office with a patient. I walked around the corner, and I saw a guy that was very friendly and helpful, and he was very professional. He showed me a few different frames, and I was able to try them out.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"Twenty years and the service has NEVER failed me!

I've been going here since I was in high school, and my 20th reunion is creeping everrrrr closer.  This is hands down the best professional tailor and alterations shop that I've visited in Indianapolis.  My first experience was with a monstrosity of a show choir dress when I was 15.  By some sort of sewing machine magic and a good darn eye for style, my blue satin dress (Yes, we looked like Smurfs) was transformed into something that was perfectly fitted and actually looked like it was designed just for me.  I've been sold ever since.

From bridesmaid dresses to ballgowns, school uniform pants to casual attire, I have taken everything under the sun to this shop.  Each and every completed piece has more than exceeded my expectations.

The service here is top-notch, and the prices are SUPER.  Also, there's a pretty fast turnaround time with most alterations.  Whether you need your pants hemmed, or your super-ugly bridesmaid dress made over, I promise this is the place for you!"
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I kind of had mixed feelings about Wish List which might be why I went with three stars. The staff here are friendly and very attentive. There was one at my side immediately once I started showing some interest in a ring in their case offering to open it up and let me try it on. They also have a really great selection here. I was happy to see that a few of their things also came from local Edmonton artisans.

I found the prices here though to be quite high and they pretty much stayed that way regardless of what I looked at. Also this is just my opinion but I find there are quite a few stores on Whyte that offer similar products and there was nothing about this particular store that made it stick out in my head over the others.

If you have a little extra money to burn or are looking for a certain line of giftware it's still worth coming in for a peek and enjoying the good customer service. It just isn't my personal cup of tea."

It can then be re-imagined and all things nostalgic. It is a large location filled with a variety of unexpected treasures and curiosities. It is only open the first weekend of every month. That is from Friday night to Sunday afternoon. Attend when you can. Maybe go twice. I always do that. I find what I might be interested and grab it. The prices are good when you find what you want. I even bring friends. I brought family and they bought a few items for their home in Orlando. It really is a great place, and you can find what you want when you least expect it.

I put in my bags in backseat and some guy names Sean bangs on my window door, and immediately starts yelling at me because my car has been parked out there for over 30 minutes. Wtf?

Shopping,4.5,OR,"Bad experience. Went with a bride and the first thing I noticed is what a small selection there was. I see people saying what a wide variety there is...maybe if they meant one of each variety... Sizes are ridiculous. One size, one tiny, sample size that no normal person could fit into. Instead of helping the bride get the style she asked for, she brought other styles instead, insinuating that the bride just couldn't get the style she wanted because she couldn't wear their tiny sample sizes. The girl working there didn't help the bride try on the dresses, but stood outside the curtain and handed them to her instead. When asked for more help, all the girl did is hold up a dress in front of the bride instead. A bad start to what's supposed to be an exciting experience for a bride. Went to CC's down the street and had an amazing experience where the bride was able to try on as many dresses as she wanted in their huge selection, with the proper assistance, and found exactly what she wanted!"
Shopping,3.5,OR,"I went in yesterday to check out a rifle. I NEEDED one....really, since I have a tag to hunt Antelope this August! Kinda like going to a dance. You cannot wear the old shoes. Gotta get new ones! Larger ones, in this case, since my other rifles won't quite cut it.  

So, I just HAD to stop in to see what was available. 

Anyway, I found a nice Savage Axis 30.06 caliber rifle. I found it on the ""used rack"" but it darn sure looks like it is unfired. It is the SP model, so it comes with a scope. I'll have to find somewhere to sight in this thing without starting a brush fire, since it is so dry out here.....lol.

The price: not too shabby at $350. They gave a ten percent discount (on some rifles this month, I'm guessing) so that was nice. I see that there are several on a gun site (ha-ha get it, ""gun site"".....""sight"".....lol) that are a little cheaper, but I figured after shipping cost and such I'd rather see the rifle before spending on one."
Shopping,4.0,OR,2 thumbs down! Came for a nail trim and up front mentioned my dog wasn't good w others... they said no problem snd put a couple away...there was a puppy pug running loose in the back which upset him. The receptionist picked up the pug but then stood right in the doorway holding the pup while it growled at my dog on the nail trim table. Not only did that happen at 1 point my dog fell off the table and was getting strangled by the leash and the girl couldn't lift him back up by herself so the 1 holding the pug went in w the pug to help.... After listening to my dog freak out snd watching the aggressive care I asked her to stop. Not once but 3 times before she did. With 2 nails left I asked to let him settle down. She got the last 2 but got his quick too! Still 1 paw shy of completing the job! My dig is a tough one to give nail trims too but this was a ridiculous and awful experience!

The first lady was very rude to me and told me that the woman who was helping me was really nice. I was quite surprised to see that the person who was helping me was a woman who had no customer service skills. She seemed to be doing her job as if she was doing her job.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"Im a professional graphic designer and created a promotional booklet for a client in Nashville. I had read great things about Midtown & so the client and I decided to send the print job to them.

I have to say, working with Midtown was such a huge disappointment. The customer service was bad, but their quality and attention to detail was terrible! 

Specifically: The pages in the booklets fell out, some pages were bound upside down, and a number of books had a random yellow page in them!  Ive never had a job printed so poorly and with such lack of care. The worst part is -- they wouldn't even refund the client's money. 

In the end, we wasted a lot of money on a promotional booklet that we cannot send out to prospective clients! It would be an embarrassment to do so. We are currently in the process of finding another printer and, sadly, starting all over.

Now unless your a fan of throwing your hard-earned American dollars down the drain, I strongly suggest you stay away from Midtown. Its amateur hour over there."

The dispensary is wonderful at taking back returns of items that you didn't like or didn't work for you.  I had an employee by the name of Michael Deja wait on me a while back.  Instead of gathering some new stuff together, he took the time to find out what my diagnosis was and then explained each product and how it could benefit me.  I'm not out for the buzz.

I had made an appointment and was assigned to Megan who had to ask me for my name, shouldn't she know it if I made an appointment a week in advance? She asked me about my budget, and when I told her the amount she made a face and said ""well all of our dresses start at $1,500, but you can shop our sample gowns that are on sale."" She offered no insight, didn't really ask any questions about my wants and needs, and was not helpful at all. It couldn't hurt her to smile either. This is not how the experience should be. If she was decent at her job, she could sell me on one of their $1,500 dresses. The funny thing is, I went to another bridal store in the vicinity and ended up getting a $1,900 dress. People will pay more when they receive exceptional customer service. The only good thing about this place was the chic atmosphere. I won't be recommending White Traditions to anyone."

Expect to pay ~$90 for a bra at Hope Chest - it's boutique lingerie.

When I arrived I was immediately pleasantly greeted and asked how I could be helped. All employees were masked. I was given my own clean tray with alcohol packets to wipe down glasses before trying them on. I was asked to try on no more than five and any glasses I touched or tried on should be put in my tray, which counted towards my selection of five. This is another layer of protection because any glasses not purchased and in the tray are collected and sanitized again before putting them back on display.

(I wish I could afford those exquisite felted hand-bags)
And, let us not forget that they support local writers of both prose and poetry (maybe other literary forms too) in their reading series which are intimate and comfortable.
Happy New Year Antigone. May you grace 4th Ave. for many  many years to come."

Shopping,2.0,OR,I just checked out in this Lowe's home-improvement store and was taken back by the rude behavior of a head cashier named Kim. There is a pro special going on where they give you 10% off with the Lowes business credit card and 5% off all other payment methods. We gave them our credit card that we use for business and they refused to give us the 5% because the credit card did not say the word business on the card. I disagreed with her because the posted sign did not state that you needed another type of business card to get the discount. Her reply was  that she didn't make up the signs. She said I will give you the discount as a professional courtesy with a major attitude including the shoulders and head movement. I asked her to please not give me the discount because of her deplorable attitude and she said fine and walked away.  I spend thousands and thousands of dollars in this store every year and I will never go back.  It's a disgrace how they treat their customers.
Shopping,2.5,OR,"So after our wonderful Ruth's Chris dinner, where did my sister and I decide to go on a Friday evening??? GOODWILL! 

Not the best Goodwill but not the worse either. I guess the biggest downfall is that it was kind of messy and in disarray.

I also thought the prices in this location were higher than I was used to. For instance, most tank tops were $4.95 and some dresses around $6. So to me, a flimsy Target brand tank top for $5 is high when a big name dress is $6... (Side note: we don't usually go to fancy steak houses like Ruth's Chris so for us. $5 for a Goodwill tank is high). 

Size-wise, this location is fairly big. There were probably 6 women's changing rooms and 2 men's. (In comparison, I've been to a goodwill that had ONE changing room).

 I did find a few items: 2 short sleeve (churchy) blouses, a dress and a bralette (Arie with the tags still on!) ..all for around $20.

The checkout lines were long though... we were there up til close and we had to wait quite awhile. NBD."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I went to this place the other day to check it out. They give you a discount on your first purchase. When you arrive there is a clerk sitting behind a glass window to take your drivers license. You get a 10% discount on your first visit. This place was very nice and clean. The bathrooms were pristine. I was there looking for CBD oil only. I'm trying to find a way to deal with my pain without medication and I've heard this really works for some. They only had one product that did not have THC in it. Been there done that. I real liked the staff that day (420) they were super helpful finding a mixture of CBD oil. The selection is small but varied, they had the ever poplar gummies which are tasty. If you are looking for CBD oil only the selection was poor. It's also a misnomer that they can removed all the THC out of the CBD, they can't!
It's like ordering de caffeinated coffee, there is a trace amount of caffeine in there, it's the same with the CBD oil."

Our pool was never 100% clean. But it's not caged and their is a large tree that hangs over the pool. However, this past week I've watched my pool go from mostly clean to swampy green. It has only been one week since they have come to service the pool. There are thousands of frog's eggs, a bunch of tadpoles and a few frogs. I tried to call BAP last week when I noticed the pool turning green. I got an answering machine each time. I left several messages with no return call. Awful service, awful customer service, awful business. They just lost another customer. 

Edit: pool tech came out this morning. He said there were no chemicals in the pool. He shocked it and dumped chemicals...and left. Did not clean up the mess. I had new pool company come out. He said the chemicals dumped earlier were off balance. And he cleaned the pool."

They were really nice and helpful over the phone so I brought my car in. They had the windshield perfectly replaced in under an hour. However, I wasn't able to pick it up right away and ran into nasty traffic that meant I would arrived after their closing time. I called and once again they were very nice and totally accommodated me and stayed longer so I could pick up my car that day.

All the instructors are helpful and encouraging. Location off Crestmoor is a bit tricky to find and parking is usually a pain, if you're going to a busier class on a weekday (lunchtime class has proven to be difficult for me). Classes are ALWAYS full... While I've never had a bad instructor, Hannah, Kady, Leigh and Jenn are all fabulous. I find myself seeking out the classes they teach. 

Studio is clean and airy. Must buy $12 grippy socks, but trust me--you need them to stay put during your planks. Not much space in the cubby/front desk area. Bathrooms are down the hall (this is an office building), and no showers. :( Lots of mirror access in the studio to perfect your form. The studio is usually warmer than I'd like but it definitely encourages the sweating! Music is awesome. I never regret making the time to come over here for a workout.

The majority of clothes are preloved (in good condition), but there are some brand new items with tags sprinkled in the inventory. 

The store is well organized by gender, size and style. Specific categories are typically highlighted at the front of the store or at the end caps. 

All of the pricing is great and they often offer sales throughout the year. Additionally they have a rewards club which is totally worth joining for various coupons. 

Recently I started selling some of my kid's clothes and toys back to Once Upon a Child. The process is easy, you drop off you items and check in online. The team then goes through your items and comes up with a bulk price for what they want to purchase. You can either stay in the store as they review, or get a text / call back. They do require same day pick up of cash / rejected items. 

The amount they pay you seems low - you could probably get much more on facebook, but it's quick and easy."

The price  was above the TV, and in so, the price should be honored, or at least, the GM should be nice and said he apologizes and maybe he could give me a discount, but, even though, no one was in the store, and they hardly have workers, he was willing to just let me walk out by saying "" It is for a different product. Well, I didn't put it there, and honestly, I didn't think he would give it to me for that price, but I thought, with all the businesses not making money plus every single one of the prices being incorrect, he would be nice and offer a discount off of the regular price.

Asking one of the employees if they had Johnny Cash and being looked at like I was a zombie, I realized this wasn't the place for me. After interviewing my friends,  I realized Grimeys is a good place for people who know nothing about vinyl. This place is chock-full-of obscure bands and local bands.

If you are checking Yelp to decide if it's worth a visit to TMR, you probably don't get it (yet).  If you are leaving a negative review because there isn't rack after rack of mediocre used vinyl, you definitely don't get it and I actually kinda feel sorry for you.

There literally would no ""Jack White"" and no TMR or retail store or anything as we now know it without the involvement of some amazing and wonderful women over the years, and the staff here is no exception.  Don't let some of the reviews talking about hipsters or whatever fool you - these girls are just cool, the kind you can't fake.  

The prices are pretty reasonable, and I'm sure as hell not some rich guy saying that.  And if it helps, do a little research about Jack's personal philanthropy and TMR's continuing charity and community involvement and you'll wish you spent a little more.

There is a larger than typical selection of warm weather clothes for both women and men including mix-and-match swimsuits for women ( sorry guys but you're left out on this feature for some reason).

Prices are better than at the St Pete Beach stores except Wings which has every place else in Saint Pete Beach beat by a lot. It would be wise however to first shop at Pirates a few steps away which has much less of a selection but lower prices.

Please do not buy shells from any of the beach stores. These are collected when the animals in them are still alive.

I regularly stop at this Old Navy on my way to visit my friend who lives in Belleville.

The cashiers here have been super-friendly and even have helped me out when I've forgotten my coupons.

Then I found out that they didn't have it. No apology or follow ups. I thought, you know, she was a new person and she didn't have many experiences. So I gave another shot. 

I visited here again this year to buy a shoulder bag. I didn't get any help, no greetings whatsoever. So hard to find who is who (floor assistants or customers). That's okay. It looked busy. I finally managed to ask the middle aged lady with sandy blond long hair, to find out whether they have this bag at this store. She told me to wait bluntly. Waited 15 minutes. She came back; ""WE DON'T HAVE IT."" very bluntly and left. That's all she said. No apology, no courtesy. I was going to ask whether they will ever receive this bag in future. But you know, she left me right away. For $435 bag, you get this kind of customer service? Absolutely ridiculous. 

I never visit this store, ever again."
Shopping,5.0,OR,"Back again! 
This time with my bride in tow!
First off, there were many thanks and praises from my wife for Rich and Ed who created (via my detailed, personalized input of course, LOL) a truly awesome B-Day gift on my last visit.
This time I wanted to upgrade our engagement ring. 
My wife and I had been speaking with other couples and gathering opinions here and there about changing our ring. However the consensus was....trade the ring in for some thing bigger, shinier, more sparkly. Huh? What? 
Never! 
We have sentimental attachment to our original diamond. It marks a period in our lives, in our history and our love that could never be replaced! Not even an option.
We needed an out side of the box, unique solution if we were going to do it at all!
This stone had to be the focal point. That was the extent of our concept. 
In comes Rich and Ed. We discussed our wants and our ""has to be"" concepts.
And now have we our forever ring. 
Original diamond in the center plus, plus.
These guys are awesome. We are so happy!
What a great experience.
Thank you Rich and Ed!"

We went shopping in the center and tried to walk in for an appointment, but unfortunately they were completely booked.  I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to a massage.  We decided to schedule for two days later and it was worth the wait.  My massage therapist was Julie and she was awesome.  I had only had a few massages before and they were when I was on vacation.  I did not expect the kind of service that we received.  The front desk girls greeted us by our first names, Julie was waiting in the lobby for me and it was just an overall great experience.  I liked it so much that I did a family add on to my moms plan so we can get massages together every month.  Super happy you guys moved into this shopping center.  I am in the center all the time."

I was amazed at how they treated me. I was told to come back in a couple days and I would be able to try on my glasses. I arrived about 30 minutes later and it was ready to be put on. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and I was very pleased with their help. I definitely recommend them to my friends and family. I bought a bike from here and it was amazing. I brought my bike in and they were very professional and accommodating. They showed me around the shop and the shop was clean and organized. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone.

I was told that they didn't have a doctor in a wheelchair, and that I would have to pay for my glasses. I was told that I could just go to a store, and that they would have my glasses, but I would have to pay for the glasses myself.

Dr.Keats was able to put me at ease and explain everything to me without being condescending but in a way that made it easy to understand. I ended up needing glasses and that's when the office staff showed how wonderful they are! Lori showed me around and jumpers me as I tried on almost every pair of glasses in there! I ended up finding the perfect pair after going in twice not able to make a decision. The entire staff was very patient with me. Today I got the call from Lori that my glasses where in and I am more than pleased! They adjusted them to my face so they fit perfectly. The entire process I never felt like they were trying to sell me add ons to just sell me stuff. Lori listened to what my life was like and helped me get exactly what I needed in lenses. I love them and will be bringing my kids in and telling everyone how great the entire office is!!!!

I went back home to look in Philly and had the BEST experience with Lovely! Sarah and Ivy are as good as it gets. Sarah was patient with me offering guidance and some much needed encouragement. When we found a dress that we thought could be the one (but a few things I wasn't loving), she encouraged me to take my time and think about it. Sarah gave me a call suggesting I try on another dress from the same designer. This was it! I finally had my ah ha! moment. Although this was around the 3rd time I was in, I was never rushed and always felt so welcome. My dress came in relatively quickly and Sarah and Ivy were both amazing in helping me with accessories. I'm not the one stop shopper, but Lovely is so amazing, there was no reason to look further. Thank you for making a once dreaded part of wedding planning truly a highlight for me!"
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I came here to get a photo enlarged for my dad. I purposefully came here to support a small business instead of going to the typical convenience store or Super Center to get the photo done. Although the original photo was very old and very small, I think they did a very good job at enlarging it. They helped me pick the right size and shape that would look good for an enlargement, and I liked that they have so many different options and ways to enlarge (canvas, glass, photo, etc.). I dropped it off on a Tuesday and they told me I could come pick it up by the end of the week. They called me on Thursday and said it was done, which was great timing. 
My only complaint are the hours, if you work typical hours it's hard to find a time to drop off and pick up since they close around 4:30 pm; however, I guess you could come on the weekend if you live in the local vicinity.
Overall nice workers in the store and I felt like I good a good value for what I paid for."

Anyway, this is your standard BnN but these stores are getting more and more special by the day. Its a great thing to have for a city. And Tampa is lucky to have this spot. 

They have a Starbucks attached to it and a café area for readers to chill. This place is luckily not swamped with students that hog the area like a library. They actually have folks just chilling, talking, sippin coffe with croissant in hand. 

They also have the media center is back and loads of DVDs. Lots of them were on sale. Some anime titles as well.  

Loads of friendly folks around to help you find something if you needed help.  I happily spent an hour here walking amongst the bookselves with chilled coffee in hand.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I can't say I know much about bikes. I did call early on the day to inquire whether bicycle therapy had any road or hybrid bikes for $400-$500 and the man on the phone was acted like they had a bunch. Sure come in, we have a few we could show you. He even rattled on about a Jamis commuter, specialized vita, etc. etc. as if there were much more.
Based on this information I was given, I hiked to the store that day (this is not close to where I live) only to find out that they don't have bikes in my range. The girl who helped me was polite and very nice. But the Jamis was something like $480/$490 and the specialized vita was $520. Nothing else. So when I called earlier, the person on the phone knew they only had two bikes at my max price range or more.
I realize my budget is probably unrealistic for this higher end bike shop, but I would have appreciated more transparency and honesty when I asked about pricing.
I'll end up getting the specialized and going over my budget, but I won't buy it here."

We ordered our leather sectional in November of 2020 and we were told it would take 12-16 weeks for delivery. Nearly 20 weeks, we were told that our sectional was going to be delivered. It is currently nearly July of 2021 and we still have not received our completed sectional. The worse part is that the communication has been non existent. We have not received any updated phone calls regarding our order. We have to continually reach out and when we do, no one can give us a straight answer. We have been told ""it's on its way"" ""it has been delivered to our warehouse"" ""we don't know where it's at"" ""I'm sorry that you were told that but we're unsure where your sectional pieces are at"". Nearing 8 months after our order, vague answers and a lot of headaches, we are beyond frustrated and disappointed in Kittle's approach to handling our order. We completely understand that there will be minor delays during COVID, which is why we ordered in advance. But the lack of clear communication is unacceptable."

I did some research online and found some products I was interested in and made a shopping trip in to see if they measured up. 

I was greeted by a very friendly (and patient) staff member who went through my list and she demonstrated each item and was very knowledgeable about everything I asked about. One product was not in stock and she searched high and low until she actually found one for me. What wonderful customer service!! 

The store is bright and clean, products
 are easy to locate and readily available to sniff and touch. Staff is available to help but not 'in your face' hovering. It was a very enjoyable and fun experience. 

They have gift boxes available in all price ranges and products for men and women. So guys.. Don't be put off by all the girlie colors and stuff.. There is a guy section too!

It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it. They have a nice selection of bikes, which is great because it is a bike store. I just went there to pick up a new bike. I don't know much about bikes, but I wanted to know how the bikes work, and they did not have a great selection. I went there and bought a bike that was a little different from what I was used to.

They have some really exciting pieces here that I salavated over and others that were clearly just for aesthetics and not practical at all as far as comfort goes. If you like color, patterns, whimsical shapes and drama MGBW is definitely a must to put on your hit list.

As far as service is concerned I will say this...Of the four associates we encountered two of them were very pleasant. A simple greeting, a little spiel and let us browse. Another seemed bored to tears to be there. I asked if he had design services and yes was all he said. As for the last, she was terribly aggressive and made our browsing painfully awkward. She followed us step by step to each piece even when we asked her if we could just browse. We literally had to escape her by getting on the elevator which thank God was nearby and going to the second floor. But overall a good experience."

When I returned in 2 weeks for the consult the artist barely gave me 2 minutes of his time. Not only did he give me attitude, but he was clearly looking down on me as if his needle was too good for my money. I asked for suggestion, he suggested nothing at l that I was looking for. In fact, he suggest a piece he had already done on another customer. Now why would I want something you've already done for someone else!? That was all the help he could give me. So, I decided to set up ANOTHER consult with yet another artist. When that date came, the artist didn't show. He also didn't bother to let me know that he wasn't going to show so I drove from Jersey for nothing. From what I can tell their work is.... decent.

They uncover needs/wants and offer solutions all while creating a personal relationship with their respective clients. It is very easy to see that they truly care. To put it into perspective; I've only left ONE Yelp review.... EVER and that was for a terrible experience at a horrible restaurant. The encounter that I had with these two wonderful ladies at Ackerman drove me to spread the word. There are no gimmicks, no games, no bs, just a wonderful collection of gorgeous jewelry and superrrr patient representatives. Cherry on top- the owner of this place is ALWAYS THERE. You'd think a man with such a successful business and such amazing employees would take a friggen Saturday off... nope. He may very well have a bed in the back.

Cute stuff (think decorative throw pillows, prints, glassware, locally made tees, jewelry) at affordable prices?  Yes please.

On February 21, 2020, I was shopping for a new phone, needed to transfer a number from a business account to a personal, and maintain two additional lines for my wife and son. The salesman drew up a good deal and transferred the business line to my personal account. When we got to the register everything changed. Suddenly I had to buy a 4th line to get the sale price on the new phone. I was stuck. I lost the business line they transferred earlier, and now needed the new phone. The manager got involved in what was obviously an orchestrated plan. I was offered a different deal that was more expensive. In order to get the sale price on the new phone, I had to start a 4th phone line. They told me I could just cancel it after 90 days. Since then, I've called every month to cancel the line and I cannot. I have now paid over $500 in monthly charges on a line I do not use. DO NO SHOP AT THIS STORE. THEY ARE CROOKS. THEY ARE TRAINED TO SCAM YOU."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"This place is pretty cool. I thought it would be overpriced purely due to it's location but after perusing, I found some super duper cool stuff for really good prices.
I like old stuff, I'm going to sound like a grandma but it's just made better. I had been searching for a while for a headboard and nightstand for my little girl's soon to be big girl room. 
I've been around the block with furniture stores, everything is made like total crap, even when you spend upwards of $300 on a kids twin size bed frame.  I think that's stupid. In my rage against the machine, I also went to a gazillion resale shops and was pretty sure if I found another 1990's brass bed, I was going to lose my mind. 

This was a breath of fresh air. The people were nice, the price was good and I got a super cute vintage bed and nightstand and it is 'big girl' approved. In the meantime I also saw about 30 other things I was pretty sure I needed. I'll have to go back. Cool place, sweet finds & easy to get in and out of."

I've never had a comprehensive eye exam before - yes, I am one of those types that never go to an eye doctor for anything since I don't have prescription eye glasses, but it is always recommended to get an eye exam to know where your vision's health stands. so, I finally made an appt. to see Dr. Kim. The staff was very nice getting me all settled in, and I felt comfortable during the entire appointment. Dr. Kim is awesome, and she was very informative about my current vision status and answered all my questions that I had about the health of my eyes. During my time here, I did look around for glasses in their showroom. My advice is, come like 30 mins. earlier than your appt. time to shop around if you're looking to purchase glasses here because they do have a great selection of glasses/sunglasses from a variety of brands. My sister took forever trying to decide what pair she wanted from her top 5 picks :P 

I will definitely be coming here again for my next eye exam visit."

I can't tell you enough how much I HATE shopping for phones . It always takes forever and yesterday was no exception. Really the worst part was the wait. I did enjoy the service of being able to be free to put myself on the waiting list and walk around the shopping center.

Anyway I went back to the store after about 45 minutes because the estimated wait was 49 minutes.  I still waited at least 10 minutes. Of course I come to find out that the text service was having issues so notifications failed to go out. Ugh of course.

Anyway the time when you finally got to see a t mobile employee wasn't bad. The person who helped me did not tell me his name but he had beautiful sleeves of colorful tattoos that I openly admired. He was awesome and answered all my questions.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"Think Gravity Pope meets Naturalizer. Kunitz Shoes carries high-quality brand comfort shoes for men and women, with names such as Clarks, Ecco and Merrell. Shoes for everyday, formal wear, or your next backpacking adventure -- you name it, they probably have it, and in a version that is less likely to give you blisters ""to boot!"" Get it? Ok, that was a bit cheesy ...

But seriously, I was impressed with the selection. You may think that comfort shoes are boring and ugly, but Kunitz carries shoes that are both attractive AND comfortable. This may mean that women (myself included) can no longer hide behind the old excuse that pretty shoes weren't meant for comfort!

They have quite the collection of ladies' boots right now, on sale from the previous season. Definitely worth a stop if you are looking for a new pair of quality leather boots. I like that their boots are cute but still practical, not overly done or flashy. Everything is leather as far as I know, both real and synthetic.

KOL installed the WRONG granite that was vastly different than the one we had chosen, but of the same shade and did not match our white cabinets. We had to point out the mistake before they fastened the stone, in which not only did the company agree the stone was different, but they knew! They tried to trick us into thinking that this was the same stone because they ""dropped"" the slab we had hand chosen, and had no more of the same granite. Then, we tried having them fix it and install another stone, they tried up charging us on a higher level granite, however this was the only granite that matched! In the end we chose a full refund and are now stuck waiting weeks until another company can come out and complete the project with NO counters and NO sink for that time!

I've only used them for medicine for my cat so far but with their excellent service I may switch my own medications to them. They always supply extra syringes for my cats meds and put the medicine inside an outer bag filled with ice to ensure there are no temperature fluctuations as I travel home.

1. I liked the food court until it became a hangout for kids. There weren't so many charter schools downtown 10 years ago. Since then I've found better options. The best thing is just that there are so many seats. There's some good low key spots way in the back. As others will tell you it gets very crowded. Eh, I don't dig food courts much anyway.

2. Greeting cards... this actually pushed me over the edge to start buying cards elsewhere. I didn't appreciate how the cards skewed towards women. The Father's Day cards were mostly garbage. One card shop closed and one remains.

3. I still like Ruby Tuesday, but I only go maybe once a year. Since I've begun yelping I feel a lost opportunity cost in going to a place I've been before.

In the summer of 2017 my fiance and I decided we wanted to get married, and that we'd like to use a set of fourth generation rings that had been worn by both my mother and grandmother as their wedding rings (my great grandmother wore them as a cocktail ring). The problem was, they had been worn for so long that the platinum on the back had worn thin, and they needed to be reshanked. We took them to several different jewelers to get estimates, and Clayton Jewelers not only impressed us with their professionalism, but also offered us by far the most competitive price and speediest service. There was a very small delay in their finishing the work, and they offered a discount that we thought was more than fair.

You have to be a regular if you want to catch a good deal on the silver age comics. If you are able to combine their 20% discount then you may come out ahead of an ebay equivalent, plus it's in your hands! They occasionally have some good Amazing Spider-man copies as well as other old Marvel titles, which is what I buy.

Current comic prices are hard to stomach at full price and their subscription discount is decent, but I prefer to pick up comics at a better discount online.

The statue prices are average, I haven't found any steals but they aren't over-priced either. I picked up a DC Flash in '15 and continue to look. They do carry some FS Bowens, which I collect. The employees are always helpful and willing to discuss their industry.

I don't feel as if they mark up their yarns too much (I have experienced this in other stores).

Overall a great little shop that will surely not disappoint. Tell the hubs to wait in the car. You're gonna be browsing for a while! ;)"
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I love Athleta.  Wall to wall and floor to ceiling it is stocked with beautiful feminine work out wear.  There is yet to be one trip to this store where I do not make a purchase of at least two items.  Everything in this store fits me like it was custom made for me and to be honest - I like fancy work out clothes, it motivates me to push myself harder.  Their merchandise is top quality and trust me when I say - my stuff gets worn & washed a lot!!  Everything holds up exceptionally well, the colors do not fade, the seams do not come appart and the shape does not get mangled in the wash.  No see through yogas here, this is top quality stuff.  
Now it is true, their merchandise is a little on the expensive side.  But you get what you pay for and you can find some really cute stuff in their clearance section in the back of the store.  The staff is always friendly & I enjoy chatting with them about the merchandise.  Great products in a great space - love, love, love Athleta."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"Holy moly! This place has a ton of loot but geez, is it expensive or what? I know Yelp is all about small, local businesses but when a place is as pricey as Big Shark Bikes, maybe you're better off shopping on Amazon.

Despite the fact that I'm an extremely casual cyclist who doesn't really know much about the art, I still get a sense that this place is just a tiny bit poseur. Take it with a grain of salt, I guess, but maybe you'll feel the same way.

The selection of bikes here, though, seemed unparalleled: there were all sorts of choices ranging from a couple hundred to probably some worth thousands -- lots of gear and other equipment, too. The staff seemed knowledgeable and friendly and free maps of STL bike trails were available near the front entrance. I would definitely trust these guys with my ""vehicle"" if I were to take it in for repairs.

People ride bikes for many reasons. I personally do so to save a little money while spicing up my commute and enjoy some exercise while I'm at it. Because of this, I'm not sure Big Shark is right for me, but your mileage will vary."

I took a lamp that stopped working. I didn't know what the problem was, but the person I handed it to thought it would be a simple fix. She said it would be about a week, which was fine. So 1.5 weeks later I hadn't heard anything and decided to call. I talked to the guy who was working on it and he said that once he got into it it was a lot more complicated so it was taking longer than expected. He updated me on the work and told me he would call when it was ready. 

4 more weeks go by (so now it's been over 5 weeks since taking it) and I haven't heard from anyone. I call and leave a message and the same guy calls me back. He says he figured out what he has to do and I approve it. I picked it up a few days later.

I hate to bash other companies, but I've done a lot of renovation & painting in my life and I can't think of a more well rounded and knowledgeable company that I've dealt with than Helm Paint. From Sherwin Williams to any big box stores, they all compare in comparison. I was suckered in by the promise of better prices from the other guys, only to find out that I was being price gouged the whole time. For example: I was told by the manager at Sherwin Williams that if I got an account, I'd be given a contractors discount. But what I didn't know is that their prices were so overly inflated to start that even if they gave me a 50% discount I was still over paying. I went to Helm Paint and told them of my experience with the other guys and to my surprise, I got better service, knowledge, and way better prices without even needing an acct. I will never again shop for my paint at any other place. Hats off to the crew at Helm Paint."

Covid rules here and all, you cannot walk in and make a selection (which I'm sure will change down the line).  At first, this was a disappointment, but they sure know their selection there quite well.  I rattled of a list of things I was looking for in a cigar, and he was quick to come back with multiple choices and price ranges.

They let me know an overall bag spa was what i needed to recondition the leather, buff out the scuffs, and just give it a good cleaning. They gave me all the details on how to ship (no cost), timeframe, when they log the bag in their system, and when it was finished/about to ship back to me. I was impressed by the level of communication. 

When I got my bag back in less than 2 weeks, I was amazed! It was like a brand new bag! Almost all the scuffs and corner wear disappeared! The color was a richer black instead of faded. The metal work on the straps were buffed and shiny like new! They even packaged it carefully with a lot of tissue paper.

Shopping,2.5,OR,"NEVER AGAIN!!!!  My husband And I were in the market for  new bedroom set and decided to check out Mor. Typically we purchased all of our furniture from another vendor.  We found a set that we loved. We were told it would be 2weeks to get all of the pieces in. When the 2 weeks were almost upon us, our sales person calls and says it will be delayed another 2 weeks. Long story short, this delay continued for 2 1/2 months!!!!  When the set finally did get here, one piece was still missing. We were told it would be here the following week. Our delivery time was scheduled and confirmed. That time frame was between 3pm to 7 pm. 7 came and past with no word from the delivery team. I called customer service to see what was going on. They informed me they were on the delivery before ours and would be there in 45 mins to an hour.  It is now 9:10 pm and my piece of furniture is STILL not here!!!'  Tried to call customer service again and of course, they are CLOSED!!!  So NOT happy with this company and the service we have received."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"Labels introduced me to consignment shopping and made it absolutely fabulous. 

When I graduated, I needed to look smart on a tiny little budget. Enter Labels, specifically the ladies of Labels. As a college student, I didn't know a lot about what was good quality, what to look for and what was worth paying for. I owe my quality clothing education to Labels. I would come in after work or on a weekend, and the gals behind the counter would make suggestions, ""how about this dress or this suit"", ""it can go with this or that."" They knew me so well. 

 I built up a gorgeous work wardrobe and no one ever would have thought I was shopping second hand. They would make alteration appointments for me and called me when they had new items they thought I would like. Their service was always impeccable. I went to job interviews in a suit from Labels and I regularly appeared in court in clothes from Labels. Looking good is half the battle and I looked fabulous! 

I don't get back to Reno as often as I would like but Blythe and her whole crew are just amazing and I always stop in to find something incredible."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"The Black Sheep is a cute gift shop here in Irvington. It has unique offerings for moms, baby, kids, and friends. I would say about 30-40% of the products are labeled as organic, fair trade, recycled, or locally made...all of which are important to me. Some of the items can be found on ThinkGeek, and I'm sure 95% of the items can be found online, but that isn't going to put money back into our local economy, is it? I purchased a cute kitchen towel and will certainly be back as birthdays and holidays roll around. 

Some of the items include: handsewn aprons for ladies, little girls, and dolls; fair trade recycled cotton kitchen towels; quirky kitchen items like spoons, mixing bowls, and salt shakers; garden art, picture frames, cute holiday decor; hand-strung beaded jewelry from locals; tiny magnetic balls (nanobeads? buckeyballs?), inspirational magnets, and even a line of environmentally friendly greeting cards printed using soy inks. 

As a bonus, there is a wall of candies in clear plastic pails. It makes me think of the penny candy store in my home town that we would ride our bikes to in the summer. 

Plenty of parking in the lot behind and on the street out front."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"Once I came to Laumeier to take the notorious annual ""Christmas Card Photo"" with my husband's family.  No sooner did we get out of the car that my sister-in-law got sick on the curb.

Even that won't deter me from giving Laumeier 5 stars.

The park is cool--plenty of space to run around, nice trails and all sorts of sculptural works to check out.  It is also a unique spot for family photos as long as no one in the party is uh... under the weather. ;)

The Laumeier Art Fair is also exceptionally cool.  This year they had over 200 artists displaying everything from jewelry and glass art to photography, ceramics, textiles, paintings and mixed media assemblages.  Over 10,000 visitors flock to the park for the fair, but it never feels crowded because Laumeier is enormous and there's plenty to see (and I'm also probably desensitized by the 1.2 mil crowds that show up for The Taste of Chicago).  Anyway, the park itself is good for a visit (probably great for a picnic!) and I definitely recommend checking out the Art Fair if you ever get the chance.  They had wicked good kettle corn and homemade root beer at the fair, too! ;)"
Shopping,2.5,OR,"We went shopping for tile a few weeks ago and I still can't get over how unprofessional the sales staff is at this location.   I worked with two different people while I was there.  The first one stunk of cigarettes.  It was overpowering.   We couldn't handle the odor, so we asked for time to look around and quickly escaped to another area of the showroom.  

The second person was obnoxiously rude and condescending.   She was very knowledgeable about the products actually, but her attitude turned me completely off.   I don't think she smiled once during our interaction.   After about 5 minutes of helping us, she flat out stated that she couldn't work with us, as the cigarette guy approached us first and was entitled to her commission.  Really?  We just want to buy tile and I'm not interested in who gets the commission.

Do yourself a favor.   Go somewhere else.   If you have a problem with the product and need to take advantage of a helpful customer service agent somewhere down the road, the salespeople here are the last people you'd want on the other side of the telephone."

Over the past few years I have witnessed the slow decline in customer satisfaction and general loyalty.  The owners increasingly nickel and dime the customers.  Last year they changed the membership and decrease the benefits.  They drastically increased the cost of FFL transfers.  They kicked Jared and Ann out who are two of the best instructors.  And the thing that makes me the most mad is that they now charge for use of the soda machine.  This may not seem like a big deal to some, but since 2013 I've enjoyed coming to the range and having a free soda.  How cheap can you get!  I use to get free quick cleans (and now I don't).

Maybe a week, maybe a month, who knows, lol.  She said she did not have the capabilities to know when it was coming.  But, they had billed me already so guess what?  I get to spend $30 to delete the charge and still no laptop.  I mean, we sent a man to the moon in 1969 but some reason, HSN has no way to know when something is going to be shipped.

I've been jonesing to get to a Primark ever since they landed in the US, but have never been close enough to get to one! Decided to swing out to this location on my way to Philadelphia and I was not disappointed. 

We entered through the parking lot entrance and landed in the home section. As is the season, it was fully decked out in Christmas stuff! Most expensive item we found here was $14. The home section continued into sheets and towels, all very reasonably priced. Overall, I thought Walmart prices with Target quality. It was amazing. 

Women's clothing largely occupies this two story behemoth of a store. I appreciated that they had a lot of different styles. Teens and mom's were shopping together, which was an interesting change of pace! I'd say the average price of an item was around $15. Definitely need to try everything on. The sizing was pretty inconsistent; I ended up buying a couple items in about 3 sizes. 

They've also got shoes, bags, accessories, men's and kids. I could have easily spent another hour in this store!

My guy and I where looking for more ideas to spruce up our patio and i remembered passing this place so we drove over.
This place is huge and we had no idea what they carried. 
As you go down the driveway you notice some trees and small buildings.  What a surprise to find not only plant life but pottery  and shops with indoor and outdoor goodies.
Personally I love succulents and I was so happy to see so many varieties and sizes. 
My other half was happy to see so many indoor plants, spider plants, ferns, fruit trees and flowers for planters. The prices are reasonable on many items but there are mid range as well as more expensive items.
We both found some colorful pottery that we will be purchasing. 
They carry plant stands, pots, ceramic animals and metal work for your garden . I fell in love with the metal goat and her baby.
The shops offer a variety of art works for your home. Batea bowls for display, Catrinas, Tree of Life, lighted metal cactus, metal mirrors and a lighting fixture and Frida displays.

Pros: They really do specialize in quirky inventory. While there were some blah pieces here and there (solid colored tops, lots of Old Navy and Target brands), there were also PLENTY of one-of-a-kind pieces that made every rack interesting. They skew young; lots of high waisted things, lots of crop tops. I am a real thrifter and I hate overpaying. After reading other reviews, I went in expecting everything to be exorbitantly priced. However, found a generous armful of things within the budget I wanted to spend. Their pricing is a bit disorganized (mall brands priced high with a few treasures priced low), but that makes it part of the fun. The place was clean and organized well enough. The employees were SUPER nice. We interacted with three of them and each was very helpful. Like others have said, they do have some good jewelry hidden in their cases. My teenager loves this place and wants to go back ASAP. She found a 90s windbreaker and is in heaven.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"My husband and I just went here to pick out our wedding bands after we had gotten my engagement ring here, which we also picked out together. The owner and employees have been very helpful and patient when we made our selection. The rings are reasonably prized and customizations are not a problem.
My engagement ring is a beautiful antique white gold ring which they sized to my hand and for which they also got a different stone for us. It didn't matter much to me what the actual stone was, we were more about it being the right color. We picked out a turquoise blueish color and they found three different stones for us within a couple days that we could choose from. It too about another week for them to set the stone and change the size of the  ring. The ring is absolutely beautiful and I have gotten many compliments in it. 
Our wedding bands are supposed to be ready within the next two weeks, they will be created as we picked a specific style which they did not have in my husband's size or as a female ring. I am excited to pick them up and expect them to be just as perfect as my engagement ring."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"Why wouldn't I want to workout more often when I leave an amazing athletic shop that has friendly, upbeat and positive staff who not only keep the store maintained but clearly care about themselves and their own overall health?  The clothing, equipment and staff create an atmosphere that makes me excited to go out and sweat... and feel confident & cute while doing so.

Yoga mats: Lulu's 'The Mat' is the best yoga mat I have ever practiced on.  Non-slip, durable, thick and comfortable for any asana, it's a must-have for beginners and serious yogis.  Worth every single penny... twice!

Yoga clothing: clothing TRULY meant for yoga, not clothing with a tag that says for yoga and clearly doesn't stand up to the task.  I don't ever want to practice in anything else because of the way each item is designed to be twisted, worn upside down and sideways, soak up sweat and last forever.

Why not 5 stars?  I still find it extremely difficult (both monetarily and realistically speaking) to spend over $150 on a single workout outfit, and that's not including under-ware.  Sorry guys, I want to be healthy but will have to get there in the three outfits i'll only ever be able to afford!"

Shopping,2.5,OR,"Like many places I have to rate it for the goals the establishment is trying to achieve rather than what I would prefer. It would be like going to a greasy spoon and expecting it to be a five star restaurant; it's just not going to happen. 

What Home Depot attempts to accomplish is to provide home appliances, tools, and materials at low prices. It accomplishes this goal quite well.

Is the service great? That depends. Do they help you find items in the store? Yes. Are they courteous? Fairly. Do they ask you if you need help every time you see them? Yes (which is good and bad). Will they provide expert opinions about what works for your project? Not really. If you need that help you should probably go to a local store. 

The store itself is well maintained. They have an app that lets you quickly find what you are looking for and locate it in the store. It gives the aisle and bay number, so it's very quick. And it avoids the need for human interaction which I prefer at these stores.

One weak point is they don't have as nice of a selection of home decor items, such as lights, etc. Lowe's is a better option for those items."

First of all the people that shop here all seem just ugh. Most of them are yelling across the store in a language that isn't English. 

Most of the staff does the same. I was looking at some shoes, and the woman working in that department kept scowling at me, and kept picking up the boxes of the shoes I had by my feet. (I was buying those thank you!)

The people at the register seem robotic, beat down and miserable. Occasionally you will run across a new employee who is helpful, but the job beats that out of them quickly.  I think smiles are not allowed there. 

The store is huge, with aisles of clearance GARBAGE. My husband and I shopped for a couple hours to kill time, and found nothing to buy. The lines are long, and you can never find what you are looking for whether it is people or clothes.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"I went on just now to write a review, having forgotten that I already wrote one two years ago. I was just about to say ""BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE CITY!"" when I realized I wrote that in my older review from 2015 (above).

What happened this time is that my back wheel was out of whack, which prevented me from riding the bike without the back wheel grinding against its brake pads or gears (I'm not sure). At any rate, it happened all of a sudden. The bike had been working perfectly for about three months, since my last visit to the store for air (free).

Well, I took it in, and Curtis looked at it and realized that the back wheel hadn't been put into proper alignment by whomever fixed it last (them). But I didn't think this was the case; I thought I had hit something because the bike had been working just perfectly since I last had it worked on. (Meaning, the current problem was not the mechanic's fault in my opinion.) Well, Curtis insisted it was their mistake, and since I had bought the bike there and used them for service always, he fixed this for free when I felt obligated to pay him. He refused my money. VERY HIGH INTEGRITY."

(Considering we can be a pain in the butt when making a big purchase decision) I was looking for a recumbent bike due to my back issues. They did not carry these specialty bikes at this location but they had them at another store. However this was local to us and James was able to show me on the website as well as make me feel comfortable enough to buy this bike sight unseen. I purchased a Terra Trike recumbent bike and my wife got a Trek road bike. She is only 5' and needed to be fitted for the right size. James did a great job. We opened up a credit line which was easy and painless. David's World Cycle staff was also amazing when James was not working or busy with other customers. To make the deal even better James delivered the bike to our home. He also gave us a little class about both bikes. look you can go to Walmart and pay 1/8th the price ( which we have) but your getting crap and you will be spending more time fixing them then riding.

I believe the exam was $50-60 with my insurance. Their contacts were twice as much as online retailers so I just asked for my prescription. 

The rest of the staff was rude and dismissive when I had asked for my prescription instead of buying it there. I also came back a year later to pick up a copy of my prescription for glasses and got the same rude service. The woman did not bother talking to me after I told her what I needed. She just handed the prescription to me without a word - I did not get a ""here is your prescription,"" ""thank you,"" etc. 

Also, does not give out your PD number (which is needed to order glasses). If you are ordering Warby Parkers, their showroom at Arts in the Age (Old City) will measure your PD for free.

Check it out for yourself to see what you always wished you had with you.  
  The store is spacious so I did not feel crowded by other shoppers.  The checkout is on one end (south) and the woman working didn't greet me or leave the counter the entire time I was browsing.  I wasn't planning on hiking soon, so I ended up leaving without making a purchase, so I can't say how easy that process is.

The Lush store that is closer to me is great and the staff is knowledgeable but sometimes I feel as if they are too pushy. I love talking to the people who work there and asking questions but I sometimes just want a chance to look around at the new products and be left alone. 

These employees in this store are fantastic. They have greeted me both times I came in. Once I let them know I'm an avid Lush shopper and do not need much help, they have let me do my thing. However, they have been ready for me when I was ready for questions. Last week they even had a pot of their new shaving cream coming out at the end of this month and let me try it out! (I did ask about it specifically but was super surprised that they had a pot stashed and ready to go). I really enjoy the staff at this Lush and have yet to find a product I don't like at Lush."

I've bought a couple of things here and I'll be back. Also, they have a huge variety of glassware for sale. There are so many awesome deals here.I have been a regular at this place for a long time now. I always have a great time and always seem to have a great time. They always have a wide variety"
Shopping,3.5,CG,"A pretty average Goodwill store. But it's a very good one. The store has a nice selection of stuff, but most of it is pretty dated, so it's pretty hard to find a store that will carry your stuff. There are some really cool stuff here, but the prices are higher than others I've been to. They have a lot of great stuff for just about every budget. I found a pair of sunglasses here for a good price, and they were very reasonably priced too. The staff is friendly, and they also have a great selection of other stuff. I definitely recommend going here for clothes, but I'm not a fan of thrift stores. They're a bit pricey, but you'll probably find a good deal. If you're looking for a little something to decorate your home, this is the place to go. They have a large selection of pretty much everything you could possibly need. They also have a great selection of jewelry and accessories. The staff is helpful and very friendly."
Shopping,5.0,CG,"Thank you GOD and YELP for helping me with my purchase of a new mattress. I was just blown away by the customer service I received. Thank you!I have had great experiences with this place.  

First, they sent me an email with an estimate.  The first thing I received was a call to tell me that the item was on back order.  They told me that it would be in the mail by the end of the day.  I got a call about 30 minutes later that the item was on back order.  I called again and was told that it was on back order.  When I was getting it in, I was told that it was on back order and that they couldn't get it in.  They told me that I had to go in and pick it up.  I was told that I was never told that.  I had to get someone to come out to look at it.  I was told that they were not going to call me back and that they would be waiting for me to come back."

I told her I had to call the owner to come check the box and she said she would not give me a refund. I told her that I would not be coming back to this place for a rental car. I called the owner and she said she is in a meeting with the owner and that she would be happy to give me a refund. I told her I had been waiting for over a month to get my rental car and that I would like to get a refund. I asked her if the manager would look into this and she said yes. She said I could come back and have the car but I will have to wait. I told her that I had been waiting for over a month and that I was waiting for the manager to come out"
Shopping,3.0,OR,"I bought a refrigerator here about 14 years ago and was very satisfied with the service. So, when that died, I did some research, so I knew what I wanted, and went back to Airs. I live in Center City, so it was convenient and I like doing business with privately owned stores when possible.

This time, my experience was totally different. When I walked in, there was nobody in front. I waited a few minutes. Finally, a man came out. He didn't say anything, but just stared at me. Finally, I said I'm looking for a refrigerator. At that point, I knew they weren't getting my business. I don't shop in stores where they are doing me a favor by taking my money. But, I asked whether they had this particular refrigerator on the floor. They didn't. He went to the back to check the price. It was $500 more than at the big box stores. As I said above, I like doing business with privately owned stores, but within reason. But, even if the price had been close (within $100), with that attitude, I would not have purchased it there.

Hint to owners of private businesses, bend over backwards to get customers. Yes, you have to charge more. But, make a potential buyer not care about that."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"My boyfriend and I found what we needed today at this store and it was pretty cheap too. That being said, I could only give this business 3 stars. Allow me to explain.

He needed a suit for a wedding, so we pick out the jacket and pants and head to the dressing room. He went in to try on the clothes and I sat outside. He then opened the door and expressed concern about the fit of the pants, so I entered the dressing room. This is where the train derails.

I was instantly assaulted by the most putrid, foul smell that I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. I asked my boyfriend what that smell was and he said he didn't know but was horrified as it was atrocious. It can only be described as a rotten foot, mixed with a dirty butt and in fact, I did describe it as such multiple times out loud, prompting a man in another changing room to yell out in agreement. My boyfriend thinks some Lysol would help while I believe a dousing of muratic acid may be more suitable, but either way, something must be done.

But yeah, good stuff and prices. That dressing room will haunt me for years to come though, hence the two star deduction :("
Shopping,3.0,OR,"Yes, it is actually a lot quieter during the weekends. This mostly due to the downtown core layout and how downtown becomes a ghost town past 6pm on a Friday. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it makes it easier to find parking during the weekends. If you try go during the workday then you have to really pay the absurd downtown parking rates, so public transport is recommended. There is a wide variety of stores for you inside, from The Bay, HMV, EBgames, Holt Renfrew, Gap, Shopper's Drugmart, and more. There are also 2 food courts and a Tim Hortons located in the middle of the pedway of the two buildings on the 2nd floor. There is also a pedway to Commerce Place (where you can find Henry Singer and Holt).

The recent revitalization of the shopping centre has really helped boost their appeal. I also prefer going here if I don't want to rencounter the rush that one would find at WEM on a busy weekend. The hours can be a bit inconvenient as well; open only until 6 from Monday to Wednesday, and only open for 5 hours on Sunday. The parking is still a drawback that is hard to get over as well, but otherwise don't expect to walk out empty handed."
Shopping,2.0,OR,"If I could give a zero star I would. Do not purchase from here expecting things to go smoothly. We purchased a mattress through them being very firm that we are leaving the state and need to have the mattress delivered before we leave, and if they could not do that to let us on our way to mattress firm that could have had our mattress delivered to us in our new state. The sales lady assured us it would arrive and we would have no issues. Well, that was until they called to schedule delivery and we were told that it wasn't going to make it to us. We asked if they could have it sent from the store in our new city, which would make sense since this is a large chain. Their answer? Not possible this is a franchise they don't speak with other stores. So now, we are losing money and time due to the incompetence of the sales people here. To top it off, stores in other states don't honor pricing/deals from other stores. What's the point of saying you price match as a company if you literally don't price match your own company. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND GO TO MATTRESS FIRM, DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME!"

I have a Newmar motorhome and they are a authorized Newmar service center. First of all it took them 8 months to give me back my coach, yes 8 months!  Of the 10 items to fix only 5 were actually done right.  The other 5 were either not done or not done right.  They eventually refunded me for 3 of them.  The other two worked when I tested it out before leaving but soon after they stopped working just like before I took it in to them.  Problems were from slideout issues, awning covers, windshield leak, and window and door seals.  My bill was over $4000 ( $1000 which I was eventually refunded ) $500 of the total bill was for time they spent trying to fix a problem but was unable to figure out the issue.  I could have taken my coach back but I live 250 miles from Nampa, Idaho and I didn't want to give them another 8 months!  If you like your RV and want things done right, stay away from this place!!!"

Our salesperson Don, was the nicest and least pushy salesperson I have worked with in a very long time.  He offered up design services as we were set to furnish multiple rooms.  Don and Renee came out to measure our home while it was under construction and about 22 degrees.  They then put together an amazing plan for us and worked within our budget.  Delivery day came an not one piece of furniture had a scratch or nick.  When an issue arose (lacking hardware for our dining room table), they sent a person out to bring it to the delivery people and everything was complete.  The overall quality of each piece is amazing for the price, no junk wood and very sound quality craftsmanship for the product.  We purchased a mattress here as well, and it has turned out amazing.  Can't say enough about how easy Don, Renee, deliverymen and everyone at Haverty's made the furniture purchasing process for my wife and I.

I have been to many bike shops in Philly, and though I love the cramped overstuffed atmosphere of this shop that somehow makes it warm and inviting, it is actually the worst service in the city. I recommend you stay far away from this place....

They actually PUT MY BRAKES ON BACKWARDS after fixing a flat (that deserves all caps because it almost killed me actually, finding out that my bike did not have working breaks). I also always have to wait even for simple repairs, and they never do anything on the spot. Its always crowded and a complete mess, and I always get flat tires when I get my bike from their shop, not sure if its a coincidence, but its happened 3 or 4 times. Plus, they only take cash, which can be inconvenient. 

Fortunately, this city has places such as Bicycle Therapy, where I promptly took it to fix the breaks, and have not been back to Via since. Oh, and I agree with Ali F. that the guys in this bike shop are the cutest, but still, its a terrible horrible place no one should ever go to, unless you want to meet cute bike store workers that is."

When you first walk into the store you'll be greeted by their seasonal displays. I'm such a sucker for the items on display that I usually end up buying something. This is not such a bad thing because I'm the kind of person who decorates her house according to holidays and seasons. Yes, I decorate for Christmas but it's Halloween that I/we are all about AND HomeSense breaks my bank every year when it comes to Halloween.

I've also had good luck buying kitchen items here, like spatulas, Oil/vinegar bottles, oil spray bottles and other handy dandy kitchen gadgets. Everything I've bought for the kitchen has lasted so this is a testament to the quality of their products.

The last big buy was this past week - picture frames. I finally found what I was looking for and bought everything that worked for the theme in my basement. Thank you HomeSense!

They also sell a variety of hockey and figure skating equipment and they know what they are talking about when they are helping you with the purchase.  Many of the people who are working are involved in the sport so they are knowledgeable about the equipment, your actual needs now and in the future.  They also are amazing at ensuring items fit properly.... I have taken skates in and they will take the time to heat mould them to her feet - something that's important for a a figure skater.  And, they will do it until it's done well and to the skaters satisfaction, not to theirs.  

Pro Skate does sell skate sharpening cards, gift cards so they do make great gifts.  And, what I love about their skate sharpening cards - I don't lose them.... They keep track on their computer of the number I have used and let me know how many I have left.  So it doesn't matter who takes the skates in."

I wasn't certain of what to expect, as some stores in this shopping center can get claustrophobic. I felt that this one was laid out thoughtfully, with handbags/accessories in the front, followed by clothing in the center, and shoes in the back of the store. The store itself is bright and cheerful and the staff are helpful. In fact, one of the tunics I was trying on had a rip in the sleeve, and the salesman quickly fetched a replacement. When I stopped in there was an excellent sale going on (more $s off the higher the purchase amount ratcheted up) though it was refreshing to see the discount applied to everything in store. The fitting room setup was lovely and I did not feel rushed. There is also a sale rack where the fitting rooms are located, where I snagged a couple bargains as well. This is the only dedicated Tory Burch in the area, as there is not even an outpost in KC's Country Club Plaza. Definitely worth a browse if you are interested in seeing more of Tory Burch's collections than just the typical shoe/handbag offerings in the department stores."

We originally came in as walk ins on Sunday but arrived too late; I guess they close at 6pm on Sundays rather than their usual 8pm. So we made appointments for the next Thursday with Erin as all reviews here rave about her. We arrived on Thursday only for Erin to not have been there as she wasn't feeling well but the piercer, Nic, was the one who taught Erin how to pierce. She did a fantastic job at easing our nerves with light and humorous conversation. She made the process of choosing jewelry very simple and easy. My only complaint was that the pricing was a bit confusing as I originally wanted gold but the total price would come out to $100 however I thought she meant $140 due to the way she phrased it. So I went with surgical steel instead amounting to $60. Both my friend and I purchased hoops with balls attached, hers being $60 and mine being $20 for the earring alone and $40 for the piercing. Everything was very sanitary and professional. I thought Nic was super nice and great at her job. Both my friend and I would definitely go again."

They have all of the necessary electronics for your needs. Home entertainment, security, cell phones and so much more to include appliances. I am not sure how many employees are supposed to be working the service floor, but I have only seen a couple on any of my random visits. Like I said, I've been greeted at the entrance, at the cash register and when exiting, and that has been the extent of my interactions with employees here. The interior of the store is neat, clean, the floors are free from any debris or inventory. The parking lot is large.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I visited this record store after checking out the brewery across the street. The staff were knowledgeable, and I conversed excitedly with one of them about old school blue and jazz musicians, and how I was stoked they had a few Leadbelly (Lead Belly?) records. I don't see those very often, so I grab them when I find them. I tend to search for the typical same records/musicians when popping into out-of-town record stores (Janis Martin, Leadbelly, Red Hot Peppers, Brownie McGhee, Janis Joplin, Bessie Smith, Beatles stuff I don't have, Cheap Thrills, etc.). 

That being said, it's a spacious store, with a wide range of new, unopened records, re-issued oldies, and used records, too. Record stores are always a surprise, since inventory is constantly changing and new stuff is always arriving, so it's nice to find something awesome while checking one out for the first time. Staff was nice, and I was glad I could have a conversation about blues with someone who didn't make me feel stupid for not knowing everything there is to know about the subject. I dig blues and jazz, but it's still something I'm learning about. 

5 stars because of the great selection, plus the fact that they had several Leadbelly records, and I know he's not an artist that is lisened to by everyone."

Brittany, the ""manager"" who completely disrespected the cashier helping me, refused to put the head manager on the phone when I called.  I know Robin, the head manager, was there because I waited for her.  but unfortunately, my son was getting restless and I had to leave.  Brittany was so rude on the phone.  This cashier was helping a paying customer and she threatened to write her up because she thinks she has power over her.   That is NOT management!!  That is being a BULLY and she needs to be the one written up!!  There is a professional and respectful way you treat your employees and she needs a good lesson in that!!"
Shopping,1.5,CG,"I wish I would've read this before I bought my engagement ring. The person who helped me was super nice and helpful, but also very knowledgeable and honest. She helped me pick out a beautiful ring and helped me find a diamond that I really liked. I was very pleased with the experience. I ended up going back and purchasing the diamond and having it custom made. I will definitely be back. This place is great, I like that they have a better selection of wedding bands than any other place I have been to. They also have a great sale rack where you can get a lot of different things for sale. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a wedding band. I was in the area for an engagement ring and was looking for a new engagement ring. I had a vague idea of what I wanted, but I decided to go to the store on a whim. I found a great ring in my price range. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The store is clean and organized. They have a large selection of jewelry and accessories."

I highly recommend this place.I love this store! I love their selection of items that are affordable and the staff is friendly. I'm not a huge fan of the prices but I always find something I like. They also have a lot of great gifts!I stopped in here on a whim and was a bit disappointed. It's a cute little store and I had a great time walking around. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

I went in and was greeted by a very friendly young lady named Rachel. She took a look at my son's shoe and gave me a great discount. Rachel was super helpful and knowledgeable. She said she was doing a quick repair and that she would call me back. I arrived at the store and Rachel helped me get my son's shoes back. She was super nice and helped me pick out the right pair for my son. She was very patient with him and was very patient with him. Rachel was very helpful and had a great eye for detail.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"I went there for a simple shampoo and trim. Never realizing it was going to cost me $47. I could have lived with that if the person I had was not so condescending and rude. Her name was Jessica and it was the worst experience.  I asked about the rainbow color under my hair and just said I just found out about it. She pointed out it had been around for years but never asked if I wanted to know more. Then I asked before I left about just getting my hair colored and the length charge because my hair is long. Once again, she told me no one had called it that in years and told me it depended on how many tubes they needed to use. To me it was the same difference but it seemed to make her feel better making me feel stupid.  She never even smiled or said we hope to see you again. I went up front to pay and when the cashier asked me if I wanted to leave Jessica a tip I said no. Never an inquiry why. When she mentioned enrolling for the rewards program I told her I would not be back. Once again, no inquiry why. When I worked retail this would have concerned me but apparently not them."

When I asked the young lady if someone could help me she offered two gentlemen to assist. The one who assisted was Andrew W I told him I wanted a 50 or 55 TV  he escorted me to the other side of the store because he said where we were standing were 55 in and up. 

I ended up purchasing a 50 "" Sony or so I thought I got home and while eating my dinner went over my purchase which was to be delivered because I wanted them to mount it on the wall. That's when I discovered it wasn't a 50 "" but a 48"". I called the store at 7:00 pm and the young lady named Amy tried for 20 minutes to reach someone anyone in the store and no one picked up. She sent the salesperson, and all his managers a email to tell them what took place. 

I have always shopped at the Best Buy in Willow Grove but this is the first time that totally disappointed me... 

Kudos go to Amy who tried for 20 minutes to reach someone  to correct this problem."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"It had been 6 months since I had my eyebrows and face threaded! Scary business indeed. It's pretty difficult to start over in my later years with all new people! Like Dr. s, hair stylists, nail tech ect. I really lucked out today finding this great spot in a pretty deserted mall. I had been to this mall a couple of times before since there's a USPS store inside. When you walk in the front (Plumb) it's just on the left side, you cannot miss it. It's cute with 2 reclining chairs. It was very neat, clean and well organized too. I walked in and was lucky that Saru was free to do my job. I get really nervous about letting someone new do my brows since I've had bad results in the past and it's not pretty ;) 

She practically did my entire face, whoa I didn't realize how bad it was. I was impressed that she used rose water on the areas that were a little red. Also I have found that this can REALLY hurt; but it hardly did at all! Nice!
Saru was very sweet, friendly and gentle. It only cost $15. 00, what a great deal! She gave me a punchcard to use each time I visit. Great find and close to home! I will be going once per month from now on."

I was there when a customer was giving her a hard time which she had absolutely no control over but this person was just a cranky old lady who has nothing else better to do except spread her misery!!! PEOPLE GIVE THIS MANAGER A BREAK BE NICE!! BE PATIENT! STOP EXPECTING THE MOON!!! She is doing more than whats expected of her!  No one deserves to be treated this way!!! Also the comment from Libby M below sounds like someone is to lazy to bend down and pick up larger items, GET A SHOP VAC Oreck sells them! 

 Went in with my Oreck which was not working  and the Manager Gina took my vacuum in the back and immediately diagnosed it and discussed my options.  I decided to buy a new vacuum because it didn't make sense to fix it.  Gina took her time explaining/showing me the features of the new vacuum then she carried it to my car!!!! WOW what service!

Shopping,4.5,OR,"Left Bank Books doesn't have the biggest selection of books, nor is it the best price, but what it does have (in spades) is character and the fact that it's one of the few independent book sellers left in St. Louis.

Whenever it's a birthday or holiday and my aunt gets books for us, I know that they came from Left Bank Books - she's a big supporter of local businesses and for that I applaud her.

Going in to Left Bank is like stepping in to a candy land for adults and book lovers. I could literally spend all day in there just perusing all the interesting titles they have, saying, 'Hi' to the resident kitty who hangs out in there and reading snippets of this and that. It's a dangerous black hole that way.

Another cool thing about Left Bank is that they host lots of authors on various nights, both local ones and traveling ones, and they'll order any book you can ask for if it's not in stock.

While I can't say the ease of the Internet booksellers isn't extremely tempting (and I use it often, I'll be honest), there's something so comforting and familiar and friendly about walking into Left Bank Books and walking out laden down with new books knowing I just contributed a little bit more to St. Louis commerce."

I was told that the manager would be there by Monday and I could call back in a few hours. I never got a call back. I will never shop here again. I will tell everyone to shop here. I am a huge fan of Mor and it is not my first time.This is a must-see at the Santa Barbara location. It is a cute little store and has a good variety of merchandise. 

The staff is friendly and helpful. They will help you find exactly what you are looking for. They have a wide range of sizes. 

The shop is small and small enough that it can be easily missed. However, if you are looking for a gift, this is your place."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"For me, it's always a bit nerve wracking trying to pick out a new doctor...  Isn't it a bit weird that it's easier to get reviews of resturants (say here on Yelp) than thorough reviews of doctors?  And I've had some BAD experiences with new doctors...

Anyway, I also had a bad experience calling Philadelphia Eye Associates (see that review) so I tried New World Vision which is also close by.  They have Saturday and Sunday hours so they gave me an appointment THE NEXT MORNING.  Amazing!  When I headed to the store I was a bit thrown off by the neon signs on the front window, but the service ended up being great!

First of all, I'm lucky to have two sets of insurance coverage for vision (my regular medical benefits plus coverage through my union) and the receptionist was fantastic at showing me how I could utilize both my benefits to get the maximum coverage and to get glasses and contacts at the same time.

Dr. Dinh did my exam.  He was thorough, friendly and very approachable for questions which I think is so important.  He's one of the reasons I was compelled to put this review up here.

Highly professional and recommended.  (Closed Wednesdays and no doctor in on Fridays.  But again, they have weekend hours!)"
Shopping,3.5,OR,"I love this store. It's the #1 reason I go to International Mall at all most of the time!  The service is wonderful. They always go above and beyond to make sure I'm happy and have everything I came looking for. I have never had a bad experience here.

The free gait analysis is very helpful when looking for proper shoes. Running shoe shopping can be quite overwhelming if you're new to it! They also have a 30 day return/exchange for shoes if you're unhappy with the ones you picked out. 

This store carries the most variety whether I'm looking for compression, running attire, hydration, gels/fuel, running accessories, safety equipment, recovery tools - you name it - they have it. If they don't have it, they will order it!

It is definitely worth it to become a Fit2Run club member. All the price tags have a heavily discounted ""club"" price! 

Be sure to grab one of their monthly calendars to keep track of the long list of events, group runs, and training programs they hold here! There is always something going on!

And of course I can never leave without making a stop at the smoothie/juice stand.
My only wish? They open one just as equally awesome closer to the Brandon/Riverview area. It' quite a hike to visit this one, but anytime the opportunity arises, I do."

They even have a small wall of adult videos but an entire section for men's wear, toys, and prostate health accessories, which I don't see at many other places. Their women's lingerie selection have some sexy yet elegant pieces in a beautiful variety of colors. They have sale rack in the back-left side of the store. They also send out frequent specials when you join their free membership program. You can only try on 3 items at a time (Required to keep underwear on when trying on items!). What caught me by surprise is that they allow spouses to sit in the dressing room with you! Sadly I was too busy holding items to take photos of the store, but take my word that they have an impressive selection of items.

Aside from all that, what definitely sold me was the knowledge and helpfulness of their sale associates! They are very welcoming in answering any questions you have and they do so with sufficient detail. They're not judgmental or overbearing. They were friendly and attentive to anticipate customers needs. What more could you want in a shopping experience! They've convinced me to join their membership. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area!"

I was quite surprised to see that there was an additional section of books that were very similar to what I was looking for.

I have always been a little curvy but never too big and I can say all the wedding dress places I've went to I always had trouble with trying on dresses because they only go up to certain sizes. There are so many girls who are a little bigger in certain areas....maybe a bigger butt, maybe a bigger bust or hips, or if you're like me you have broad shoulders. I went into Brides by Young and met with Lauren who was an absolute SWEETHEART from the start. She respected my budget and ideas and you could just tell that my dress shopping wasn't just a business transaction to her, but a relationship because she wanted my special day to be perfect! She took her measurements, she made sure to give me all the information I needed as well and when my dress came in it was literally PERFECT!! The sleeves were absolutely gorgeous and fit to a T! The only thing that needs done are maybe a little bit of alterations which is expected! 

All in all, Lauren and her team at Brides by Young were absolutely fabulous!! They listened, you have a great selection and you definitely won't be disappointed to purchase their unique and gorgeous dresses!"
Shopping,2.5,OR,"I purchased an Arlen Ness rotor through them via Ebay. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong part, it was completely my fault. However, Kelly, the Parts manager was able to help me return the part and find the correct part. He even steered me to another product from the same manufacturer that would better suit my needs at the same price. Kelly gave me solid advice and helped me fix my mistake, He even called me to let me know the part was shipping instead of just sending an email. Although I purchased this a few months ago, yesterday was the first chance I had to install it. I'm not a new rider naive to motorcycles, nor is this my first time purchasing parts online.

That being said, I'm thoroughly impressed with the front rotor.  I have read the bad reviews online but after the experience I had, I can't image the poor service people have described coming from this company.

Strangely enough, the huge parking lot at 6 pm was crowded, but not like the mashup between rush hour on the Beltway and a demolition derby that I expected.  I found a spot within close walking distance to the front door of the big box store.  Upon entering, I was again shocked by the lack of chaos/near riot of last-minute Christmas shoppers fighting over the last PS3 console or Dr. Dre Beats headphones that I had expected.  That said, the shelves and racks had obviously been picked pretty clean by holiday shoppers.  Since I was there on a mission, I asked a very helpful (and seemingly not shell-shocked) clerk where I could find what I was looking for.  He pointed me in the right direction and offered an insightful recommendation on the two competing products.  Thanks, another Christmas gift crossed off the list!  I was also there to get a replacement power adapter cord for my dad's laptop.  Yet another Best Buy employee was there to answer my questions and point me to the right selection.

Shopping,4.5,OR,So this week has been so rough at work. I was making sure my daughter had fun bath after recieving honor roll and decided I needed one too. I had my friend run with me to the mall so i could run in and out- I rushed in and was grabbing the things I wanted to use my gift card on and Chauncie was there making sure I was taken care of. She told me about the new facial products (amazing and I did end up purchasing the Sleepy Face) and doing it so in a quick but caring and informative manner. After she made sure I got everything I needed Bernard checked me out and was just the best. He chatted with me but got me through quickly and Zach made sure that I felt appreciated and welcome the entire time. On my way out- Mia made sure she thanked me for coming in and routed me on through my run to the car. This all sounds so silly but its the little things (that are actually huge) that make all the difference. Of course LUSH has top products but this store has the BEST employees. I feel like I have a mega jump on my weekend and dont even care that I have to drive 30 minutes to work tomorrow. Like- lets freakin go.
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Ladies in store are nice enough but quality of items not so great.  I bought a headboard and when it was delivered he would not assemble it even though I asked. I'm a single mom who could have used the help.  I had to put it together myself and it was a disaster.  Box spring had a hole in it upon delivery as well. When I called she did offer to send someone out but by that time I was done. Wasn't worth the money I spent and will probably get another bed at RC Wiley or Mor and just eat the $400 I spent at this place. 
My sister also bought a couch there and the delivery guy just showed up at her door, never called or warned her. She was at work but our mother was home and not knowing, let him put it in her garage.  Must have been same delivery guy as mine because he never offered to bring it into the house or even take the plastic off. When my sister did get a chance to get plastic off, it had a huge hole in the back and the wood was sticking out. She called and let them know.....that was over a month ago and she's still waiting for a replacement.  Their delivery men are lazy."

Primarily stocks novelty type fabrics - the front of the store is arranged by theme, for example beach, dogs, insects etc. Middle has some less theme oriented fabric arranged by color. Very few modern prints or designers save a bit of Cotton & Steel scattered here and there. Smallish selection of RJR solids and big holiday themed section in the back. Big selection of books and traditional patterns. On a Saturday afternoon staff seemed to outnumber customers about 3 to 1. Only one (a gentleman who seemed to be carrying on a running monologue with himself) greeted me. One shadowed me for a while. I'm a respectable looking 50 year old but I do have tattoos covering both arms, maybe this put them on high alert. By the entrance there is a sign saying ""no photos"" which is bizarre, and a bank of security camera monitors. The cashier seemed to resent selling anything to me. I guess this is just one of those OWL stores that has no interest in moving with the times or encouraging the next generation of quilters. If I was 20 I wouldn't want to be making the kind of quilts they are making here. Sad to say but I'm sure this store will die off with its customers, like so much of the quilting industry."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I LOVE Lush, but the location at King of Prussia was pretty terrible.  
I know it's pretty common knowledge that Lush employees can be a bit nosy, but King of Prussia really took it to the limit.  As I previewed gift sets, two ladies told me what was in it, and since the Boxing day sale is still going on, they kept reminding me that is was BOGO...I'm not new to Lush!  Then, as I tested a massage bar, another lady came up and explained what it was, and when I walked over to check out soaps, another lady came up and asked me if I knew about the soaps.  
Some of them looked bored and were unenthusiastic, and when I asked for a sample of Angels on Bare Skin, I never received it.  The stock was larger than my local Lush's and the store wasn't crowded.  

This store is definitely large for Lush standards, but the stock wasn't large...but I'm not going to complain since it was the sale.  Don't get me wrong, I love Lush.  But the sales associates were just plain annoying.  I went with a friend who's never been to Lush,but they never really helped her, nor asked her if it was her first time.  There was one okay SA, but the others...ugh."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"This place is alright for a consignment shop and I found some really cool old framed photos of Philly. They had been there since July which mean that I would receive 40% off making them about 80 bucks each. Still seemed like a lot of dough to me, but I really wanted them. Then the lady told me that the discount didn't apply to art and that they were 20% off. That seemed like way too much money, and she worked it down to 30%. In the end I paid $100 each for them. HUGE MISTAKE. I went to Nadeau next door right after (which is awesome by the way) and the guy there told me that I had just got insanely ripped off and that he had bought those same framed pictures for TEN DOLLARS a piece in the summer when a guy came around selling them. Dang it. I know I should have been more shrewd, and that's probably my fault for not really knowing the value of something before I buy it, but I DO feel a little bit taken. Skip this place and go to Nadeau. They have the coolest furniture and fairest prices in Philly. I'll leave one star because the woman was nice, and it's probably not her fault that she had to hustle me so hard."

I told her I was not interested in frames that has the ""bling"" rhinestones on them - because to me thats just NOT my style - even if it is in style I hate it!!!!!!!!! 

For whatever reason this lady ""helping"" me continues to hand me frames with bling and I kept telling her I DONT LIKE THE BLING. I even pointed out what I meant and showed her, and she kept handing me pairs with it. Finally I said MAYBE YOU NEED YOUR EYES AND HEARING CHECKED because either you cannot see the glasses your handing me are EXACTLY what I've said I DO NOT WANT or your not HEARING ME.

She even made sure I was happy with the dress, so I can go back to get it on the spot. I loved that I was able to try it on and see how it would look on my body. I was not expecting that to be the case, but I was pleasantly surprised at the ""top of the line"" selection. I had a few alterations scheduled and they were the best.

My Mom's very untimely passing from breast cancer on September 30th put our whole family into a tailspin - with all of us doing our best to hold ourselves together while also trying to make sure my mother got the type of memorial service she deserved.

All of the staff at Sherwood were so compassionate, understanding, accommodating, professional, respectful, and patient with us from Day One!  They truly made us feel like family - at a time that we needed it the most.  The service was beautiful - and the attention to detail regarding the set up of everything we selected was second to none.

I no longer live in Spring Hill, but knowing from the start I was dealing with a top notch florist put my mind at ease.  Their recommendations and creativity were spot on.  If anyone is on the fence about renting the ""doors to heaven,"" all I can say is DO IT!  People are still contacting me about how beautiful they were.  

From the bottom of our hearts - the Valuri family appreciates you all.  We will always recommend Sherwood Florist to anyone who needs their services.

I would love someone to fix this mall because this mall    in my opinion is 100% to pretty to just let sit there and do nothing with and rot .

Please fix this mall and I liked the style of the Christmas lights  hanging up  . 


But add those re-model the mall to a simple modern style and add decent stores and a parking garage  and this is a perfect recipe for the malls success 

Also bring back the giant carousel in the  middle of the mall and Christmas lights and maybe add some haunted houses for Halloween in abounded buildings around the mall  and or welcome center / convention center , Indiana , Eastside ,  ,  Indianapolis , Cumberland , greenfield , Irvington ,   e Washington street  souvenir shops .

Hey also you should make advertisements saying that this mall is the best in the world and why people should come to it and how it beats other malls in the us and rest of the world.

I've also gone there plenty of times to never be greated or asked if I needed anything. I feel torn because I like the stuff thats in there but I HATE those people behind the desk.

The only thing I had to do at MAC, was show Sean what I wanted and he matched to picture to a T. He was such a nice guy and also nice to everyone who came into the store. If you're going in to buy makeup and you have questions, I don't recommend  going on a weekend since every makeup artist is busy with appointments. In addition, if you are scheduling an appointment, id recommend scheduling 3 hours prior to the ""end time"" that you have in mind.  For example I scheduled my appointment at 12 because I had to leave MAC by 1:30. I went into the store before my scheduled time  hoping they would take me early. Lucky for me, a bridal party don't show up and I was taken around 11:40 am. 
MAC employees have to do makeup appointments, answer phones, check customers out and answer questions of all other customers in the store while they are doing your makeup so this can be time consuming.

Keep in mind, I didn't get my eye exam or anything other than picking up, but this was my third T.O. location I had been to. 

At a quick glance, it seems pretty similar, but this location had a lot less kids' glasses options. (Yes, I wear kids sizes a lot. Don't judge.) 

When I first arrived and gave my name to the lady working, she went back, brought the glasses in their bright childish blue contained and gave me the greatest look of concern. It had me so worried that I had just wasted my money on a pair of useless glasses. I assured her that I had in fact ordered kids size glasses to fit my small face. 

She put them on, I liked them and so did my friend, but she didn't have much to say. She fixed them up for me and that was that. She was nice, but that lack of reassurance from her liking my glasses (regardless if she did or not) left a sour taste for me.

Everyone is driving to Ventura because their thrift stores have realistic prices.  Both Alpha Thrifts are missing the point of what a ""thrift store"" is.  They are looking too closely at eBay and deciding that much of their junk is more valuable than it is, just because someone might be ""asking"" a certain price.  Well, an ""asking price"" is NOT indicative of what an item is actually worth.  A true thrift store should price their items for a quick sale that will benefit the charity that they're representing.  Trying to be a resale boutique, or trying to compete with inflated eBay prices, will get you nowhere, Alpha.  And it will stop people from visiting your stores, as such visits will only end in futility.  When you were in Santa Barbara on State Street, you were a true thrift store (and you had fair prices).  The fact that you moved to Goleta (much lower rent) yet raised your prices three-fold does not shine favorably upon you.

There are a couple of great reasons to go here though including the fact they have great information on local sporty events/races/eco events. Even more impressive is their expertise in all things biking.

They are a non-profit organization and have been around since 1953. Year round you can donate Mardi Gras beads and throws to them, as well as purchase the recycled beads and throws. They have a large store that is awesomely organized for you to buy single items or large sackfuls. The organization not only makes for a greener environment, it helps provide jobs and field trips for people with intellectual disabilities. I had a chance to volunteer here as part of a Yelp event. We got to tour the facility and see all the thousands of pounds of donations waiting to be sorted, recycled and sold. Following the tour, we were led to the sorting room. Tony, the ArcGNO coordinator, thoroughly explained to us how to sort the beads by style, length, krewe, etc. They provide gloves to protect your hands as you sort. There is a magnificent bead mural that covers the back wall of the sorting room. It's beautiful. Great photo opp!

If you are looking to find a throw that you wanted, but missed catching, or possibly an obscure or outdated throw, check their store inventory. In one of our batches of beads to sort, we came across and old strand of beads from the late seventies."

Two weeks later I received a call saying that it was ready. I called the store and was told that they had it in stock. I called and was told that the order would be placed on my schedule. They confirmed that it was placed on my schedule and that it was in stock. I went in to pick it up and was told that it was ready. I called the store again and was told that the order was in and that I had to get someone to come pick it up. I asked to speak with a manager and was told that they would not be able to help me.

I have purchased the most beautiful jewelry and have never had a problem with the staff. I highly recommend coming here.I used to love this place. I always feel like I'm in the middle of a music store, so I was excited when they opened. I was just in a jam with friends and we ended up chatting at the end of the night. We were in the middle of the night and the girl at the front desk was super nice and didn't try to push any buttons. I wish I had been there earlier in the evening but I never would've been in this place.

Shopping,2.0,CG,"Being a new resident of Tampa, I thought it would be a nice place to get a tattoo.

I had a friend who was going to have a tattoo done at the Art Museum. She had her own tattoo artist, a young blonde girl named Jay who was very friendly and knew what she was doing. I was able to tell her what I was doing and how I was going to do it. Jay was able to show me some cool techniques and a few other things that I could do myself. Jay made the process easy, I could tell he was going to be a pain in the butt and he was definitely willing to go out of his way to help.

I ended up going with Jay and I will definitely be going back to the Art Museum for my next tattoo.I am a huge fan of Sephora and I'm happy to say I stopped in this location a few months ago.

Shopping,2.5,OR,"I want to start out by saying that the older staff here is absolutely awesome, 30 and above totally golden. But someone really needs to tell the younger staff that this is not social hour. The last three times I have been there I have tried to get help from one of the younger staff and it's always a mess. All that I have come into contact with have been rude, unwilling to help and visibly annoyed at being asked. I went there looking for something that my mom needed that I have never bought before and decided to ask a girl who was stocking a shelf to help me. I said something about the product that I believed to be correct and she scoffed at me and said that it didn't exist. I then asked her to show me where similar products were and she sort of generally waved in a direction and turned her back on me. I went to go find it, couldn't and returned to find her and another boy around her age flirting and laughing and not working. I ended up finding it on my own but please, this store is so close to my house and I really don't want to have to drive forever because your young employees don't know how to have a job.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"Edit: It needs to be known that their price gouging is getting out of hand. Walked in there to see bunch of stuff that is $10-15 when its sold NEW in box; They where selling it (used, scuffed, marked up and now dirty with their stickers) for $25-30. When I pointed this out and said I would appreciate paying a fair price (I even brought up the price for new in box collectables that I was trying to buy on my smart phone to show them I wasn't lying), I was told ""Thats the price and we aren't going to change it"". Absolutely 100% unreasonable to be pricing used and donated items so much higher than their original new instore price. I've yet to see this problem at other VV locations, and I visit each one of them often.

Shop here a lot for toys and kids clothing, and I've saved a lot by doing so. Everything is clean and well organized, they usually have tons of variety. The only issue I have is they often price used items for higher than the original purchase price (and sometimes they don't take the original store tags off items so you can see you're paying more for it than you would in the actual shop like Walmart or Winners). Other than that, this is a great location and everyone working there is very polite :)"
Shopping,3.5,OR,"Hadn't been to this JCP in awhile because I usually shop at a different mall. Ordered a swimsuit online and the info in my confirmation said it would be ready to pick up the next day. Went in a few days later to get it. The first thing I noticed was how filthy the entrance to the store was.  There were food containers, spilled food, butts, and other trash all over the steps and entrance. Some of it had obviously been there for some time. Inside was not  much better. I know the season is changing and they were moving a lot of merchandise around, but everything was so cluttered and crowded and just seemed dirty.  Went to customer service to pick up the item. The clerk tried to put in my phone number at least 5 times and my order never came up. Finally another clerk had to show her how to login or something (I was not bothered by that, she seemed newish and not very well trained.)  My order came up, but had been cancelled.  What???? She said sometimes they cancel if the item is not available. I don't recall getting an email saying that. In fact, that day I had gotten one reminding me of my order.  Overall a wasted, unpleasant trip. Will not be going to that store again any time soon."

I went to pick up some random items and they didn't have a good selection of anything. I ended up buying some prints and they had a really nice selection of frames. They had a lot of great prints and some of the prints I was looking at were not as big as I wanted. I'll definitely go back to this place. I went here to get my eye exam for my first time. I had a vague idea of what I wanted, but I never saw anyone else look at me. When I went to get the eye exam I asked if I could come in for a follow up appointment and she just stared at me.

Shopping,1.5,OR,"I just contact there customer service manage about furniture that color is fading(never use any chemical on the surface).

I bought more than 10 thousand dollar of furniture from them and  this is their response at first and I quote - ""I have reviewed the pictures and the sale history.  With these two items having been in your home for well over a year they are out of the warranty period"". 

She changed her strategy after i pointed out that the furniture has 5 year warranty and reply back at me- ""in looking at the pictures, it looks like there are a number of water rings on the surface of the round table; the marking on the cocktail table looks as though it could be the result of  ""damp dusting"" which would lift the finish.  These are issues that would not be covered under the manufacturers warranty.  The factory will more than likely point out the appearance of the oil products that are on the cocktail table as perhaps contributing to the deterioration of the finish.   I will forward the pictures to the vendor, ask them to review and will let you know as soon as I hear back from them.""

Shopping,2.5,OR,"The store itself is okay. The selection of clothes is better than the VS at Neshaminy. However, they are extremely understaffed, and the line is always too ridiculous to wait in. 

I tried going there in the daytime thinking there will be less people so I can make a few returns of the stuff I ordered online. Yes...there was less people BUT the only person at the register was a very rude girl (I'm pretty sure she just had a bad day) but still she was completely scattered and took at least 30 minutes to check out each person. 

So, once again, when it was my turn, she took so long to do my returns that the 5 people standing behind me in line were almost throwing tomatoes at me. It was ridiculous. I asked if they can put one more person behind a registrar and the manager told me ""Sorry, it's pretty slow today so we don't have enough staff to help..."" BUT SHE'S A MANAGER...she could've helped! 

Also, there was about 4 girls working there but not at the registar...they were just passing shopping bags around and stuff even though there was practically no customers besides the ones at the registar. 

This is a multi-billion dollar company. They can't hire a few more high school kids to help out so that people don't have to dread the line when going over there?!?!"

Saw they were new in town and had done a nice job on the store front so I figured I'd give them a shot. Couldn't have been happier with my experience there. Really a high quality doctors office with extremely nice people working there to help you. Called to make an appointment (I believe it was Justine on the phone) and she was able to get me in right away. She gave me the details I needed as far as insurance coverage and what I could expect for my first visit. Walked into the place and was immediately impressed with the lobby and selection of nice frames. Justine got me set up in no time and was in to see the Dr in minutes. I had Dr. Mills, who was very professional and courteous. He was thorough with his exam but explained the ""what and why"" a long the way. Turned out I still had 20/20 vision with a little far sightedness (surprising given my years in front of a computer). Dr. Mills told me to check back if I had any problems and thanked me for my visit. I generally do not write yelp reviews but I was just very impressed with my visit there so wanted to give these guys a shout out."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"Frankly I am a little disappointed. I came here when I was 14 and it wasn't memorable so I forgot that I had gone except I had a blurry Kodak picture of a flamingo to show for it. 
I came here with my mom yesterday now that I'm considerable older and meh....I'm glad we went on a living social so at least I didn't pay full price. The stuff isn't labeled in accordance with the map...and the map makes it seems like the place is so big but it isn't. Wide open space it isn't! We had some pretty pictures to show for it at least but the paths were narrow so you collided with apathetic tourists (and let me tell u some of them do not know how to drive ...some guy cut me off in the parking lot  just to veer across 3 lanes of oncoming traffic to turn...this isn't the big city dude...there's no need for that)
As for the park, it felt mazey to me and 
I have no sense of direction so they could have  made it less confusing by actually labeling the grounds with the corresponding numbers on the map you think? That way I would have known that I saw everything. The highlight of the place was the cute white and green parrots and some pretty flowers here or there. Otherwise I could have done without it."

My appointment started at 1 and finished at 5:30. The last 15 mins was my haircut which my bangs are crooked and my hair isn't even close to what it usually is.  I said I usually have three layers.  And she said yes each time but didn't ask me how I wanted my hair cut.  If the cut was alright.   The color looked ok at the place but after I saw it in my mirror I knew it was too dark.  To spend that long in a chair and get this result was mildly disappointing.  My husband was wondering what was taking so long.  I had to cancel plans because It never has taken so long before.   I should have known from the beginning when they brought the color of my highlight and lowlight and asked what kind of color.   My answer. You guys are the professionals.   Way too much money for lack of services and quality of the end product.  They wanted to go home and I did too.   I will not be back. Ever.

I feel their prices on brushes, paints, and paper are very fair, and they have frequent sales as well. If you are a student or teacher they offer a 20% discount on non-sale items if you show them a student/teacher ID. 
Shopping at Arizona Art Supply I have discovered some tools I would not have discovered or been able to try out if I was shopping online. I have found new papers I love, as well as some great brushes, to name a few. I do think they could add more varieties of pens for calligraphers (nibs, nicer dip pens, more varieties of Tombow pens) as well as adding some more variety to their watercolor/gouache paints (Prima watercolors would be fun). Overall, this is a great store if you are looking to try something new but don't want to commit to a new form of art. It's also a great place for all your basic (and advanced!) tools. They also have classes in different mediums, and the staff is always eager to help and incredibly friendly, as well as knowledgable regarding the supplies for sale."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"All Fired Up is such a fun activity for a family, date night, or just by yourself! As true to the other reviews, All Fired Up got rid of their sitting fee which means now you only have to pay for the price of your pottery. This is great because if you don't finish a piece you can always come back and still just pay the initial price of the pottery. 

When you walk in, there are SO many pieces to choose from ranging in prices and skill level. I went with a dog bowl, which wasn't too complicated. I also liked that there were examples throughout the store to give you some inspiration. 

The employees will explain how the paint works, and the key is to paint a lot of layers! The paint area was great, but the stamp area could definitely use some updates. There was a complete lack of organization of the stamps and a lot of the stamps were very outdated. It was hard to find matching letters, and then once I finally decided on a stamp it turned out pretty bad so I ended up painting right over it. 

Other than that, there were a large selection of brushes and paint trays. The pottery takes about a week to get back, which is a pretty quick turnaround.

Shopping,3.0,OR,"Tech support in here is terrible. You're better off going to MacExperience just east on 82nd in Castleton. I took my computer there on a Saturday and then Sunday to get a problem fixed, and needed a wipe and reinstall of the operating system.

Dropped it off on Sunday, was told it would take 24 hours. That was fine, since I was leaving town for 2 days. I returned on Tuesday and was told they hadn't fixed the problem, but they had ""sent an email"" to ask for permission to do the thing I had asked them to do on Sunday. (They never sent an email; I checked everywhere.)

So when they go to do the re-install, they discover there's a bigger problem, which will involve them checking some wires on the hard drive, and then possibly replacing the hard drive.

They would have discovered this if they had actually called or emailed me on Monday. But rather than be proactive and actually ask whether they can do the work, they waited until I showed up, and caused a longer delay. Since my computer is how I make my living, their incompetence is costing me money.

Apple works great when everything is operating properly, but their actual tech support is lacking. If you need to leave your computer to get them to work on it, avoid it, unless your stuff is under warranty. Head 6 miles east to the MacExperience."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"I didn't even realize Great Escape had a location in Madison until recently.  When I went in to check it out, I immediately realized this location easily trumps the one on Broadway.  In addition to a decent selection of CDs, movies and vinyl, they also have action figures and posters.

The staff at the Madison Great Escape clearly knows what they're doing.  The two dudes I saw working in there today were Led Zeppelin fans with clear penchants for comics.  The Pop/Rock CD selection was relatively sizable, but I didn't find anything very impressive.  The Country section was also large, but I didn't really check it out.  What was surprisingly enormous was the VHS section.  They had countless titles, and, probably because of the lack of demand for VHS, they were all extremely cheap.

Great Escape also had loads of comic books and figures.  As I've noted before, I don't really read comics like I used to, but I intuited that it was a respectable selection.  They also have a few posters, mostly Pink Floyd and TONS of Marilyn Monroe.  The whole place smells fiercely of Nag Champa, and they actually sell an enormous variety of incense in the place.  Talk about a diverse inventory.  This place will keep you occupied for at least an hour or two.  I say put it on the list."

She made our entire experience  magical by allowing us to come back and see the lotus flowers up close!! It was my mother's birthday so it was a dream come true for her. The lotus flower is my favorite flower because even though it grows in the muddiest ponds, it overcomes it's dirty environment and blooms into a beautiful flower untouched by any filth (metaphor for us going through life positively no matter the hard obstacles we face). 

The garden was much bigger than I expected! There was so much to see and I'm amazed by all the different plants! They also sell plants and there were so many cute succulents! The garden is free of charge which is so nice and they are open 7 days a week. We originally were going to go to Lotusland but Seaside Gardens is so much better!! Price wise (free compared to other gardens), friendly environment, being able to go up to smell the flowers and guide yourself through the garden is so nice.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"Every year I look forward to our family trip to the tree farm. We have been going every year for 20plus years as a family now and normally love it! The animals, hay rides, hot chocolate and people normally make it a great trip and experience. However this year with COVID and the lack of precautions they are taking made the experience not worth the drive out there. 

When we arrived I was appalled to notice that no one on the staff was wearing a mask! That's the people who handle the trees, drinks food etc.  NO ONE! No gloves even for those in the kitchen also struck me. Next was the lack of social distancing. The wagons were packed of people sitting close together and no where did they have signs encouraging social distancing or even limiting how many people could get on the wagon.  For this reason we chose not to take the wagon and look at one of the pre cut trees. They did also have a sign in that area saying Masks are only recommended for those that chose to get on the wagon not for the general area.

They're stocked with all the usual surf-beach items like wet suits, boogie and surf boards, sunglasses, sandals, sunscreen, caps and sun hats, swim trunks for men and teeny bikinis for the girls. Unlike most surf shops I've been to they actually carry some beach cover-ups and casual clothes that can be worn by a woman over 16. (I have my eye on a cute printed cotton tunic.) 

The salespeople are friendly and helpful. I was greeted at the door and when I had a question it was easy to find someone to help me. 

Truth is, as nice as the store is, I only came here to obtain surfing lessons for my kids.  After reading all the great reviews we signed up for a private lesson and Akila took my son out for an hour and a half lesson. Success! He was standing up and riding some small waves within a few minutes.  The next day we returned for another lesson this time with both my daughter and son. My daughter had more difficulty surfing, but Akila was very patient with her. I thought she would become discouraged but no, she had a blast. Lessons are $90 for one person. $75 each for two people. They provide a wet suit and board. 

So it's a cute shop with helpful employees and great surf lessons!"
Shopping,4.5,OR,"""Oh, Battle of Little Big Horn? Don't you mean Custer's Last Stand!"" 

I almost saw an old-fashioned donnybrook in the Eiteljorg when my fellow patron aka ""Whoops-I'm-so-incendiary, when I say yeah... I'm a direct descendant of Custer's right hand man!"" said that above quote with pride, out loud, to my other fellow patron who takes pride in being 1/16 Cherokee. I'd recommend going to the Eiteljorg with opposing factions -- like go with Mel Gibson & the entire human race, maybe?

The high ceilings, the funky gift shop that gets you to touch & pick up everything, the really treated & well-finished wood, the cool guy that runs the front desk (at least when we were there), the interactive exhibits that make you press the buttons over & over & over to hear strange words... like... ""sahpeewee."" Say it with me now...sahpeewee. 

Favorite exhibit: the photography in the upper west wing. 

The cafe looked stellar, but was closed when we were there. 

And... well... those dancing deer out front are gorgeous, and are an emblem (to me) of our city. And, well, it's great to splash around in, or at least dunk your feet in, to cool off on a hot day while walking around downtown.

Final note... some museums are really pushy for some reason about their pamphlet maps and this one seemed that way. I appreciate the wandering aspect of museums, and the Eiteljorg is fit to roam."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I've gone to two glass experiences at Third Degree this year. The first was my mom's 70th birthday party. I organized a private experience for 12 people to make a glass tile. Reserving the event was a breeze and the event itself was a total hit! We had an hour to pick a tile, create a design from scraps of glass. There are all kinds of colors and shapes of glass to work with. The instructor explains how to cut/shape the glass to make what you'd like. The pieces are then coated in a glue to ensure they don't move. Third Degree then completes the last step of melting the designs into place and adding a magnet, nightlight, etc. to the back to allow use of your design. It was such a unique experience and each tile turned out so neat!

The second experience was making a paperweight. My husband and I had a private experience with artist Tyler. Tyler did a wonderful job explaining what we were going to do and then guiding us through the entire process. It was so neat to get to put hands on and begin to understand glass blowing and art. We selected our colors, got to turn the glass in the fire, shaped the glass, added bubbles to the paperweights, and even got to put our initials in the paperweight.

I have attended ""Palmer Park"" (as simply referred to by locals and artist alike) several times and notice that while many of the artist are returning. However, there is always an infrequent artist that pops in and catches my eye  Why spend money on a print or cheaply made decorative piece at a big box store when you can acquire original pieces and meet the talented artist who created such a beautiful piece?  Seems a no brainer to me.

On this trip, I scored a handblown clear vase with a smattering of brightly colored

This location at West Ed has two floors, with an entrance on each level. My friend and I lost each other here once, as we both got so distracted and mesmerized by all the different arts supplies they had here.

You can find supplies for painting, sketching, scrapbooking, framing, and beading here, with a large section for each. They have ready-made photo frames, or you can get one custom-made if you prefer. There are a lot of holiday items right now, which you can customize and dress up however you want. I like to come here for unique craft papers and card applique stickers, because they have such a great selection.

DeSerres can be kind of expensive though, especially if you're picking up a bunch of supplies for a project, it can really add up. But they usually have some items on sale, and it's always worth a look. I managed to snag some pretty good stuff from their clearance corner last time.

And DeSerres was the only place where I found a reasonably priced scrapbook too. Scrapbooks are usually expensive, and sometimes you can't find one you like because the selection is so limited, but DeSerres has shelves and shelves of them, and chances are you'll find one that suits your tastes."

This store has the rudest store clerks ever.  First, when looking around I was never asked if I needed help then I stood in line to get the gift card for over 5 minutes while the two cashiers helped customers in front of me.  One clerk was extremely slow and the other cashier was so busy visiting she could not check her out and could have cared less about me or the others standing in line.  I was in line alone and then joined by two other people.  Just as I thought it was going to be my turn a lady walked up to pay her bill and completely cut in line.  Rather than ask who was next or say, these ladies were first they started helping her!  Sorry, I am not invisible, I walked out and then immediately called the manager who acted as though she was puzzled by what I was saying.  I think she was joining in with the cashier visiting with a customer.  I will in the future drive to Baton Rouge, Mandeville, or shop online rather than stepping foot in that store.

Well, I did not expect to find anything and ended up walking out with bagsfull of items - including a Kate Spade handbag. For what it's worth, the handbag selection here beat the selection at the Galleria Nordstrom - especially in the clearance/markdown department.

I also scored a coup in shoes, with a couple of pairs of flats and a pair of Cole Haan red patent heels. The designer shoe selection isn't as comprehensive as the State Street Nordstrom, but then again, I generally just give that section of the store a cursory look. I was especially pleased to find a rack of Vince tops that, while still pricey, were a bargain compared to full retail price. A year ago I would have balked at paying north of $100 for what is essentially a t-shirt, but these are timeless silhouettes that will take me well into the fall. Finally, for those who are dismayed by the across the board lackluster selection of women's nightwear, this location has a few pleasant surprises. I am a fan of the Eileen West brand, and the nightwear section at this Nordstrom delivered.

I clearly identified that I was moving from a specified size storage unit to the same size unit at another storage facility a short distance away.  A reasonable quote was given, however when the time came for the move, the mover underestimated the truck size, causing 2 hours of additional work (first trying to put together all of my stuff like a puzzle in the truck to make it fit, then another extra hour going back to make a 2nd trip because not everything fit).  They charged me for the extra 2 hours.  When I objected, their rep (Radu...not sure of the spelling) was extremely rude and would not allow the objection.  He said i owed them a lot more money which totaled double what was originally quoted.  I said I wouldn't pay it, and instead just paid them approximately $100 more than the quote.  He charged my credit card without my authorization for an additional amount.  It's understood that estimates are not exact, but DOUBLE the cost is completely unacceptable, as is putting charges on a card without authorization.  I would not have hired them if I knew their quote was so high.  They scammed me into hiring them.

I was highly impressed by the variety and affordability of the crystals. The standalone crystals were way cheaper than ones of the same size at my local crystal shop back in California. I couldn't believe that a decent size chunk of black tourmaline was only $3, for example. 

Additionally, TerraDona also carried crystal jewelry, art pieces, candle holders, wind chimes, and fair trade products.

The staff is very friendly, and knowledgable!  The facility is very clean (as clean as a nursery can be!) the shop cat is absolutely darling! Most of the trees are grown onsite, which helps a ton when acclimating the tree to our climate! The indoor plants seem very healthy, and unique! The wind chimes are wonderful! They carry Corinthian and festival, (amazing quality, and beautiful sounding bells.  Great for housewarming gifts, or a Christmas gift for the parents)(shh don't tell them that's what I'm getting them for Christmas)  their selection of bird feeders is INSANE!  Seriously, I had no clue there were so many options! They have a large selection of pesticides and plant food, but I have not needed either yet, so I can't give specifics!  

Then there's their outdoor plant section..... Holy moly!! It's amazing! Seriously, they have everything! Every time I come here, I want to redo my entire yard! All their plants look healthy, and beautiful! And of all the plants I've purchased here, I've never had one die(other then the one I forgot to water for a month..... But I don't think that's their fault!). 

I would suggest this place to anyone who is searching for a unique gift, outdoor or indoor plant, bird feeder or windchime!!"

Went to two different Wal Marts looking for a charger for my Nexus 5, and finally found one at the second Wal Mart, got it home and its broken. Took it back and went to T Mobile. Im already tired of burning up my Saturday (i should be home smoke a blunt or drinking some whiskey, yea, i know its only 10am) but i digress. So, i enter T Mobile and I am greeted by a lovely lady named Kimberly, whom has the most amazing hazel eyes ive seen in some time. She is very nice, and doesnt appear to care that i have a black hoodie and pajama bottoms on, with a pair of very clean, new Vans. I look like ive just woken up, and i had! Weird! Anyways, i tell her my plight, and she is on it. She finds the accessories i need (a little pricey, i will be honest), but she is so nice and down to earth, i cant help but love it here. She asked for my number and name (for the receipt ), and i let her know its totally ok if she wants to call me. Nevermind the fact im probably old enough to be her father, she was just very sweet and laughed it off like a champ and delivered wonderful customer service. I hope they give you a store of your own Kimberly."
Shopping,2.0,OR,"I've used this company many times over the years, despite finding the cuts on the metal frames to be off, leaving sharp openings at the corners, and despite cuts on wood frames resulting in chipping, and cross cuts at the corners of the mats, mainly for the convenience of being able to just order what I need to do my own framing of art and cross stitch projects. But, after this last fiasco with them, I am done. I placed a $150 order with them with components for several framing projects. 2 frames were flat out missing from my order. I called, and they claimed to ship them out, but sent them to the wrong address (???). I finally received them, only one was not even the size I ordered. So, now I am out $$, it is MONTHS since I placed the original order, and I still don't have the frame I need. 

The other issue with this company is that they have this promise of using reward dollars accumulated from prior purchases. I have accumulated quite a lot, but the check out process never allows me to use it. And, when I called to ask about it, I received no help whatsoever. This is not a first class outfit. If you are doing simple framing of non-valuable art/conventional items, you don't care about the quality that much and you have all the time in the world, then this company is probably okay."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I am downgrading my Review because this business just sent me a private Yelp message here that fails to address the Yelp-cheating it's done (!) / continues to do (?).

Another Yelp user, Anna B., glowingly reviewed Reno Tahoe Window Cleaning here actually writing ""They went so far as to clean her wall mirror without a charge in exchange for a Yelp review.""   The owner then had the impudence to write her here on Yelp actually thanking her here for her clearly tainted glowing Review here as she brags his company had paid her to write it!  We took a screen-shot t document both.

What part of Yelp's rules here doesn't the owner understand as the Yelp rules clearly specifically state here to businesses:

     ""Don't ask for reviews and don't offer to pay for them either: Please don't ask your customers to review your business on Yelp. Over time, solicited reviews create bias on your business page -- a bias that savvy consumers can smell from a mile away. Learn why you shouldn't ask for reviews. YOU SHOULD ALSO NEVER OFFER COMPENSATION (DISCOUNTS AND FREEBIES COUNT TOO) IN EXCHANGE FOR REVIEWS."" and Yelp's rules here also state ""BUSINESS OWNERS SHOULD NOT ASK CUSTOMERS TO WRITE REVIEWS.""

See https://www.yelp.com/guidelines

I continue to wonder just how many of these glowing reviews here on Yelp of this business are tainted as they are due to the fact that Reno Tahoe Window Cleaning is clearly Yelp-cheating."
Shopping,3.0,OR,"Really hate to have to give such a poor review given my sales people were wonderful (they'd really were, went above and beyond) but Mattress Firm's customer service is awful and they do not stand by the products they sell. 

I paid over $2000 for what I thought was a quality product and ended up with a defective mattress that's not eligible for warranty replacement.

According to mattress firm, the manufacturer warranty guidelines require 1.5 inches of visible depression in the mattress and then and only then will the mattress be considered for replacement. No pressure, no laying on it, just photos to show. Given that my issue is with the springs underneath said pillow top, I'm out of luck. How do you have a warranty process that doesn't actually account for real defects? I weigh all of 125 lbs, don't even sleep at home every night because I travel often and I've somehow worn a gulley in my side of the bed that I roll into. In one year. My back hurts, the mattress is junk, but because there is only 1.25 inches of visible depression in the pillow top (which isn't even the issue), I'm out of luck. 

Their ""concession"" to me after denying the warranty claim, was a 15% off coupon with a ton of restrictions (including the mattress I purchased) so I can give them more money. 

This is extremely disappointing and they are not at all interested in making things right."

Three times the Home Depot delivery company (Spirit Delivery) called to confirm delivery, including this morning , but failed to deliver each time. Despite my requesting that they call the tenant at the condo when they arrived, they called me, and each time I had to direct them to the Order note to call the tenant. When they did call the tenant they told him on all three dates that they could not find a place to park and finally that they could not deliver to the National. When my tenant called the supervisor at Spirit Delivery, they ended the call by hanging up on him. When I called Home Depot Customer Service, I was cut off three times before someone finally tried to help by putting me through to JIM the store manager of the South Philly HD. Jim was totally unhelpful and debated my telling him that I had ordered other appliances from his store in the past that had been delivered to The National. Bottom line, my tenant was stood up 3 days, no dishwasher delivery, Home Depot can not deliver to The National, Jim the Manager, was a total waste of time, and I'm done with Home Depot!

Shopping,4.5,OR,"This was my  first visit at a vaping store so I have nothing to compare it to. It was empty at first so that was good because we had the attendee's undivided attention. We were able to ask any question. But that didn't last long. The store became busy pretty quickly and our guy had to help other people. It was maybe 15-20 mins before he could attend to us again. In the meantime I browsed through one of several mini tablets with hundreds of flavors we could choose from to sample.  The liquid cases came in different sizes ( 35 to 60ml) and many many flavors, some with nicotine, some not. 

It was a dollar to sample 5 flavors.  We were told it use to be free but a law just passed and now it's  $1. We tried pineapple, a couple of sweet cereal flavored vapes, and other fruity ones. Our favorite was cinnaro. 

So I decided to purchase a vapor. The different kinds are displayed on a glass case on the wall. The cheapest one being  $50 and the smallest size. The most expensive was $65 and the largest. I opted for the $60 vapor. We were shown how to assemble and prep. Once that was done we were ready to set off into the world of vaping. 

We were given a stamping card so after several more purchases we could get a free vaping liquid. That was cool."

Once Flex got started, he kept the conversation going with me and my husband, but made sure I was doing okay through the whole process.

Perhaps selling pool chemicals, maybe even building a pool, or any number of other things. What they are definitely NOT good at is repairing pool equipment and providing basic customer service.  

I took a robotic pool cleaner in for troubleshooting and due to screwups that they blamed on the parts supplier... I got it back today SEVEN WEEKS LATER. During that time I received ZERO phone calls with a status update.........I had to call them when 7 to 10 days would go by not having heard from them. It was almost like I was bothering THEM. Unbelievable and completely backwards.

Finally today I was able to pick my cleaner back up. Whatever minimum expectations I had at this point, they managed to even fail to meet those, when they gave me back a pool cleaner that was twice as dirty as when I brought it to them seven weeks ago. Never even occurred to them to maybe clean the filters as a sign of goodwill since they had it for seven weeks. Utterly frustrating and insured that I will never do business with them again.  When I pointed it out to the employee behind the counter... He stared blankly at me as if to say ""what do you expect me to do about it?""

Nothing.  Just like what you did for me the past seven weeks."

Upon calling I was told they did not have that any longer and was told he took it down but craigslist takes awhile for items to be removed.  This is a lie, it is instant but I went ahead and let him continue.  He told me he had a white one at the same price.  I told him I wanted to exchange a 7"" Kindle Fire HD and $150 cash.  I was told he would do that.  I drove from Fishers to Southport to pick up the device and was told they didn't have the white one, that he said he was going to hold for me but they had a black one in Grade C condition, otherwise known as a cracked screen.  The store owner when back to plug in my Kindle and the person in back said yes, I made that deal, then a few minutes later the store owner came out and said he would not honor it.  He said the Kindle Fire's retail was $100 so he wouldn't pay it, even after making the deal.

I told them it could have been a customer because my Generator was sitting outside when I pulled up to their lot.

I've taken items to Wasteland/Buffalo Exchange in California and they are super awesome with regard to an exchange of goods for cash and they make selections in front of the seller! unlike Plato's. where the seller must leave items/bags. the buyers go through it - take what they believe to be of value - they don't record which items they selected but than give the seller a total value for what they stashed. super low. and than ""ask"" if the seller wants to ""donate"" the rest - really? sorry for the rant but they gave me $21. for Timberland boots. Volcom wedges. 5 pair of Volcom shorts and maybe some other stuff - I couldn't recall everything in the 2 bags I left for the buyer. while I was waiting. naturally I shopped AND from a shoppers perspective it's a much better experience!

Id looked online and saw a few dresses I liked and wrote the style numbers down so that I could try them on. As soon as i walked in I was greeted by a woman that was sitting on her ass behind the counter. She told me immediately that bc i did not have an appointment I was not able to try on the dresses. and there was only one lady available to help try on and she was with another bride. I can totally understand that. She looked up the 5 dresses and only one was in the store. so then she decided that it was ok to try it on since it was only 1 dress. I asked for it in a size 8 but the mean lady gave it to me in a 12. The lady in the back helping was really nice. I didn't like it so I took it off and went back to the front of the store. When I went back to the front of the store i walked into overhearing the woman saying that i should not be here and she's going to tell me to call back another time and reschedule. She sounded like she was so pissed at me. Her face was blood shot red. She was talking pure shit about how ladies come in unscheduled.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"Long story short: it's a mall. Since Yelp requires me to expound a little more on that sentiment, here we go.

I agree with other reviewers who say that this is a good place for tourists, but not worth going out of your way. I would, however, go out of my way if I was in the market for something specific. One thing they have here is a fudge shop. I love fudge, so that was worth the trip for me. They had quite a few stores that were having ""season change"" sales, so it was nice to browse around and check out the deals. There is a store that sells Michael Kors purses, another that sells kitchen ware and other various clothing outlets. The food court is okay- there are some pretty basic chains like Cane's and Izzo's. The one burger place they had had the longest line of any of the food options. There's a daiquiri shop as well as a nice little bar in the middle of the food court, if you are making a day of it and feel like drinking.

The main selling point of the Riverwalk is the view of the river. I really love any spot in the city where you can hang out on a nice day and watch the water. I just have different memories of the Riverwalk from when I was a kid. I remember more local places and less chains, but I could be imagining things.

It's good for what it is, but nothing overly special."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"I'd never been in a Half Price Books before. A fellow Yelper (Rachael) had mentioned I could sell books there which never occurred to me! I brought in two boxes that had been sitting around in my house since I moved 6 years ago. Sure, some were college textbooks that were 15+ years old, and others were fiction that had been big but were past their prime. All of them were in great condition for their age. I got $12, but it's likely for mostly the fiction books. Half Price Books donates any books they can't resell so I get some cash for the useful ones, and the others go to places that can use them. 

To sell, go to the back corner of the store. You'll need your ID and a phone number. Then wait in the store for your offer. They'll page you when it's ready. Then you can take the receipt up front to cash it out! Very simple, and it probably took them about 20 minutes to get me mine. 

While waiting on my cash offer, I strolled the aisles and found lots of fun stuff! The prices are so much better than other book retailers that sell new. They also sell CDs, DVDs, and some other electronic equipment. I may bring in my old digital camera and see if they'll take it! I didn't make a purchase today, but I enjoyed looking around.

The store is small and quaint with combinations of items for the shower and bath that benefit your skin as well as your mood.  I was warmly greeted being welcomed to the store with inquiries about what I was looking for and what could they show me. I was not disappointed.

 From the moment I entered the store I started to relax and that is what I explained to the lady that greeted me; that I was looking for something earthy and very relaxing like a bath salts, with scents similar to a patchouli or sandalwood.  She prepared a demonstration a small pale of water to possibly assist in the choosing processes.  Taking in the different aromas up close was unique, satisfying, and made it difficult to choose.  The first one she showed me was the Honey Bee Bath Bomb that had a delightful earth smell that I really could not part with.  A couple of others were nice but not what I was looking for: one was very citrusy and another smelled like clean linen.  Both would have been delightful given a compatible mood.  We ended the sale with a brief discussion about soap making and the different processes; it was pleasant to end a purchase with a discussion embedded with knowledge.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"I visited Tampa recently, and my sister, a fellow beader, recommended this bead store. It's a well stocked store for the amount of space, and I was impressed with the amount of Delica beads she carries; I found colors and finishes that I've not seen elsewhere. The owner could not have been any friendlier or more helpful, and made sure we poked through the half price baskets for random treasure. I have a fairly large inventory of just about everything at home, so wasn't looking for anything special or making a very large purchase on the day I visited, but it's a store I would be happy to have if I lived in the neighborhood. The completed jewelry on hand shows excellent workmanship, with a variety of beautiful beadwork and metal work on hand for inspiration. She also offers free classes on Wednesday (I think; call the store!). I've been beading for a long time, and have never seen a store that offers free classes, especially in peyote stitch and beadwork. That's truly special, and shows a passion for the craft that I found inspiring. I found the prices commiserate with bead stores in other parts of the country. Shopping at bead stores will usually cost a bit more than shopping on line; these people have to pay for overhead. You pay in part for expertise, thoughtful curating of inventory, and the opportunity to share a hobby with other people that enjoy it. You'll find all of these things here.

When the manager came to the front of the store to approve the credit, he never even looked at me.  When I got home, I went to the BB website online and found the EXACT product I returned IS still being sold by BB, which means the employee LIED to me to avoid taking my return back.

She sounded sympathetic and then told me she can't help me because my item was bought in the Willow grove store and not online.

During that time, I had returned to buy a gift card for a friend. When I walked in, there were about 5 guys behind the counter and I was completely ignored for an incredibly awkward amount of time. When I finally spoke up, a few of the guys looked at each other as if none really wanted to be the one to help me out. Eventually I was able to ask one of them for a gift card (even though I was slowly beginning to regret the idea) and he informed me they only took cash... Once I returned from the ATM, the guy I was dealing with was gone and I was ignored again. Finally when someone else took my 100 bucks, he handed me a paper business card with $100 written on it in sharpie... no receipt or anything. What a beautiful gift! Not.

I cannot speak to the tattooing expertise here; the artists could be very talented, but the customer service was SO bad. Granted, this was about a year and a half ago, so it may be better now, but it was enough to make me NEVER want to return, nor would I ever recommend to anyone!

I called them to explain what had happen to my glasses they claimed my eyes might have shifted to change my vision.

To date, the project is still pending completion. They have a builder app for timelines and it was never followed nor updated. The site does not communicate nor coordinate well with their vendors; and the vendor they work with have been very responsive and helpful through the process, because Omni was not in communication with them. They also lack professionalism when reporting issues and respond with inappropriate reasoning that was not helpful to the problem. One major concern was a water leak. It happened in multiple areas and from separate sources. Our water bill has been very high for a couple of months and have not been able to get a response nor help from Omni and had to work directly with vendors. Omni also does not meet with us in person. We take time off when they schedule time on site and do not show up, pushing back their appointments with us to review these concerning items. We also have not been able to see Omni in person and unable to schedule the last appointment - punch list, but they have instead requested pictures via text and have been finding that we have to provide them reminders or re-send pictures.

The location is right on the corner from the State Street Shopping Center and the food court is awesome. There's a lot to see and the shop is really nice. I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for something specific or a gift. It's a great store, but the prices are ridiculous. The clothes are good, but the service is always horrible.

I ordered flowers from fromyouflowers.com unaware of where they would be coming from. My fault for not doing more research. I tried calling to ask if I could just pick them up instead of having the flowers delivered as my recipient was not going to be home Mother's Day weekend like I thought. After speaking with fromyouflowers customer service and then leaving Julie's multiple messages I started calling, Friday-Sunday with NO response to them or I. WHAT FLOWER SHOP DOESNT ANSWER THE PHONE MOTHERS DAY WEEKEND?! I finally got through to julies Sunday afternoon and all she said was she can't make any changes to the order I have to go through the website. The website then said they will attempt delivery Sunday and of no ones home it will be left on the front step. Monday morning, no flowers! Shocker. After my 4th call to this website customer service I finally got a full refund and I have been trying to call julies also, and suprise I cannot get through. As a business owner I am thoroughly appalled. If she's going to go through a 3rd party to get business and not be responsive AT ALL how does she expect to ever keep afloat?

Shopping,3.0,OR,"Poor maligned David's Bridal... really I feel kind of sad about all these terrible reviews because that was not my experience. I had an appointment and though it was busy I was helped by two different very friendly and competent women in the store. At first I was put off that other brides were dressing on pedestals and in front of big mirrors while I was given a room (though much bigger on the inside) near the bathroom. I realized that that was due to me lacking half my family with me so they gave me a spot with less floor space. Also, the dress was missing a sash that they never replaced for me so I am going to call them tomorrow and ask that they send me one. I will update you all on how that turns out.

I bought a really nice tea length gown that is good quality. THe suggested some shoes and things but I never felt pressured or a victim of up selling. I really liked the lady who helped me, Deb, she was very efficient, honest, did not ""congratulAAATIONS SQUEEE!"" me but treated me like an adult who is making a major purchase. Thank you Deb, for that. They brought suggestions, were honest in their opinions and were all around great considering how busy they were. They work their arses off and I am sure its not for big bucks.

I did not get a great vibe about the alterations department so I just bought the gown alone and will take it elsewhere."

Shopping,3.0,OR,"I bought three sets of drapes and returned two of them within 1 week. I kept the other set. I had my receipts upon returning them and the girl at the service desk was initially pleasant. During the transaction, I mentioned to her that two of the 84"" sets that I bought were the same, but each panel among them was actually a different length so I kept the two panels that were close to the same length. She tried to tell me that it depends on where the grommets are placed.  However, that has nothing to do with it. I measured each of the panels - one was 84"", one was 85.5"", one was 86.5"", and the other was 87"".  (I kept the two longer ones).  She did acknowledge that the particular brand (Kenneth Cole Reaction) was known for having inconsistent lengths.
The Manager then came along to approve the refund. Then he proceeded to question why I was returning them, and lectured me on how drapes will look different in the store than at home because they have bright lighting and 20 foot ceilings. 
He acted as though I hadn't kept any of the drapes and was clearly displeased about the return. Then the girl proceeded to mention that if I ever redecorate the room, the drapes will be the last thing I will change.  A rather presumptuous attitude on her part.  I really didn't need the attitude and lectures from either of these individuals and I don't plan on shopping there again."

I work dangerously close to this location and have been shopping here for the past 8 years. Samantha is absolutely fabulous - she knows how to dress for your body like no other - and I am so glad she was there for my appointment. Being non-traditional my beau wanted to come with, and while quiet he is definitely opinionated. Samantha was a pro at reading his facial expressions & tailored the dress selection based on our comments as we went along. We explained that we wanted to stay around $700 which may sound like a lot but surprisingly many Philly boutiques start at $1,000 or more. Thanks to NM's White Friday sample sale (50% to 90% off) we never had to look at a price tag. I only tried on 5 dresses before we found what we were looking for. Another NM bonus? There are no bogus wedding sizes here. You wear a 29 jean, you try on size 6-8 gowns. Easy peasy. They have samples of all sizes and no clamps were involved, I was able to see all the side and back detail as it was meant to be. We weren't pressured to buy accessories and we got a gift bag full of magazines, planning tools, and coupons (hello $50 credit towards dance lessons). After toasting our under budget success with a glass of champagne we happily walked out of the store - with my nearly perfect sample in tow."

Do you remember the feeling when you were a kid and you walked into a toy store for the first time - so much to see your heart raced and your head started spinning?

Thanks to the wonderful yelpers I checked this place out - and like within the first 10 minutes I already had 50 dresses to try on.

This stuff is high end, high quality clothing and ultra low prices.  Some of them, even at 75-90% off I still couldn't afford (be prepared for a $600 D&G gown that retails for $5000)....but still a great deal.  You'll spend some time here - sometimes there is only 1 or 2 sizes of a piece so you have to rumage through it.  Oh, but it's so worth it!  I scored this great Milly top (retail $260, got for $59), and much, much more!

The sales staff is fantastic.  I found out they work on commission - but they weren't too pushy.  I LOVE that they bring the clothes to you as you try them on.  They are constantly taking and bringing things - no more ""you can only have 6 items at a time"".

I went in a couple days prior to my boyfriend and I going in together to see if there was anything that caught my eye. Dustin helped me at first and the owner, Amy, came over shortly and pulled out any ring I asked to see (which was probably too many to count) when I told him my boyfriend was probably going in without me because our schedules didn't allow for us to be in together he told me he would keep my selection separate in preparation for him! Luckily we were able to go together and the moment I walked in the door, without hesitation, he pulled out the few I had narrowed it down to. 

I was also informed that the owner helped my fiancé with the proposal idea! It was wonderful! 

When I went back in to have it dropped off to resize I was so happy to get to chat with Dustin! He was so friendly, personable, and funny we ended up chatting for an hour and a half! 

Just picked my ring back up and I could not have been more pleased! Not only was it free to have my ring resized but it took so little time for it to get done! When other places I had looked at said it would be 2+ weeks. A.J. Martin's had it done in less than a week! 

Thank you Amy and Dustin for a wonderful time and a memory that will last me forever!"

I called Plunkett's on 09/26/16 and spoke to a Joe.  He was not very friendly when he answered the phone.  I told him my situation and asked if there were any more in stock.  He seemed really irritated with me asking to check the stock, then came on the phone and said there were some in stock.  I asked him if he could hold one for me to make the exchange as I was not going to be able to get there until 5 pm.  He said there were some and would not hold one for me.  This was for a birthday gift and the fact that it didn't work was irritating, but I was not expecting to be treated badly over the phone.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"This place is falling apart. The store years ago used to be great, but I don't think they have made any changes since they opened including the carts. Good luck finding a cart as well, there's usually only one or two to choose from. Every time I come the parking lot is full of carts and maybe one employee pushing some back. The main reason I shop here is for goat and horse feed. The only reason I give 2 stars and not one is they always have the feed in stock HOWEVER, you must inspect every bag you load as I have had multiple problems with mice and rats that chewed holes in the bags in the store (I've seen them run across the floor). There's no flat carts for hauling loads of feed, instead you have to use a shopping cart. Again back to the carts. I don't think they have replaced a cart from the day this store opened, every cart is falling apart and is a workout trying to maneuver it though the store. The employees have no idea what is in their store most of the time and I've never had an employee ask me if I needed help. I saw an older woman walk up to three employees who were having a conversation and not one of them acknowledged her.

I asked the stylist to take a few inches off my hair and some of the weight throughout, as I have lots of curly hair. She did exactly what I asked for and I was very pleased. My stylist was friendly and chatty and I thought that we really clicked. A few months later I came back to the same stylist for a colour and cut. I told her I wanted the ends trimmed and to go lighter all over with blond highlights throughout. The trim went great. However the colour was a disaster. She proceeded to bleach my entire head of hair twice. She processed it within an inch of its life. My hair has gone from soft and curly to dry straw that is breaking off. It's a horrible yellow shade. The bleaching process took so long that I was the last person in the salon. I could tell that the hairdresser just wanted to go home. She barely put any effort into styling it. It was a damp mess of hair when I left the salon. I came back the next day to complain and ask for a refund.

1 - You can make an eye appt. online. Can everyone PLEASE get hip to this? The internet is not going out of style, and being able to schedule appointments online makes people happy.
2 - Talking to the staff at Eye Bar is practically like having your own personal shopper for eye wear. They're really great at getting to know your style, pulling glasses for you (while happily letting you pull your own), and scrutinizing every pair just at intensely as you do. I mean, choosing glasses is a major commitment, and they totally get that. When I was there, they even took pictures with their iPad (I just typed eyePad there first...yikes), so you can see what they look like in a picture. 
3 - They have a dog in the store, and let's face it, I'm a sucker for little shops that have a dog.
4 - Great brands. Cool stuff I haven't seen anywhere in my history of glasses shopping.

Keep in mind, this isn't a Lenscrafters, so you're not going to get your glasses in an hour. It probably took about two weeks. It's also probably pricier than a Lenscrafters, but the available options and personalized service are pretty special. I can also take them back if my lenses get scratched, and they give you unlimited glasses cleaner (you can take the bottle back to get it refilled with it runs out).

The staff member tightened the frame and applied heat at the bridge to bend the frame. When I tried them on, I absolutely could not see anything. After putting in a spare set of glasses, I could see that the heat applied to the bridge melted the set face of both lenses. See the attached photo. The staff member denied overheating the lenses and said my glasses where scratched. I insisted to speak with the manager and asked him to examine the lenses. He refused to admit the mistake and reminded me that the lenses where out of warranty. I persisted and he finally agreed to replace the lenses ""this time only."" Jujuan refused to admit that the staff member damaged the glasses. As an Eyecare professional, he should have been able to recognize that the severity of the pitting due to heat stress would have made the glasses unusable, yet he and the staff clearly saw me wearing them into the shop. These are the same glasses that took a month to get originally because the Clarkson staff ordered the wrong lens. Previously my wife had to have lenses made twice because of a similar mistake. I only ask that people admit their mistakes, instead of blaming the customer."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"The saddest looking flowers I have ever received. My husband tried to surprise me on our anniversary by having flowers delivered. I wasn't home when the delivery guy arrived and no one from the shop nor the delivery person tried to call me, despite the fact that they had my cell phone number. Today, my husband had to call the shop repeatedly, after the delivery person, who was supposed to arrive during a specific time window, never showed up. When he finally arrived over an hour later, the flowers were limp and flat--some were even broken. My husband called the shop to tell them and the shop owner got on the phone, cut him off, and told him that he preferred that he never shop with him again, since people like him couldn't be pleased. He also claimed that he tried to deliver multiple times the day before and never charged my husband extra for the multiple delivery attempts. UMMM...whaa....??? My husband PAID A DELIVERY FEE ALREADY. It's not his job to make sure I'm home! The flower shop is supposed to attempt to reach out to me if they've tried to deliver and couldn't, but never did! Why is this our fault? It's pretty upsetting; my husband tried to support a local business, but Philadelphia Flower Market gives small, local businesses a bad rep. I have had flowers delivered multiple times from other florists and NEVER received anything but gorgeous arrangements. These flowers are horrible, but even worse, the owner is a nasty guy who doesn't stand behind his product. DO NOT SUPPORT THEM."

Finally came in mid-March ( I never complained). Delivery called and scheduled 3/21. Then on 3/21 called and told missing one piece of sectional (weird!). Told piece would be coming in mid-April, I asked for store manager to return call. No call returned- so I called next day, guess what missing piece had just arrived (strange coincidence) I asked to speak with Manager, who said soonest deliver would be 3/29 and said she would research why missing piece suddenly appeared, since I didn't believe it was coincidental. I wanted a better explanation.  Sofa did not get delivered today. When I called said it was never scheduled and that my conversation with manager was not documented. I could've just let it go that manager didn't call me back but wanted to ask store manager, Moto, if they would give me a discount due to the trouble and multiple times I received misinformation. He would not listen to me and kept interrupting me that they don't give discounts for delays. He then said he would not listen to me because of my tone and abrasiveness, which he matched in his tone and abrasiveness as well. Moto never got trained on how to provide customer service, especially to customers who were not treated well. Lack of follow through is my biggest complaint. Beware of the treatment.

Anyway, a friend and I went to all the game stores in the area and couldn't find what we were looking for. He wanted a Dwarf fighter and I wanted an Elf fighter. After checking all the stores we could find near us and feeling the defeat of possibly never finding our characters, a member of our group suggested the Game Keep. At first we were skeptical because it was an hour or so from where we lived, however I am very glad we decided to make the trip. We finally found them! I was very excited as soon as I walked in. This store was everything I had imagined it to be. It wasn't messy but wasn't spotless. It wasn't too cluttered but it had a variety of different things. There was so much to look at in such a little place and the best part was that the people who were tabletop playing at the store were in a completely different room of the store. Which made it a really nice experience. I hate going to these stores and having to walk around tables and ask people to scooch their chairs in and such. Not to mention the distraction of it all. For them and us. But this place was obviously decorated and set up by a true tabletop gamer."

Most of the  shoes on the shelves go up to a men's size 13. So in order to see if there  are any in the store at all we had to ask an associate if they could check. 

There was a nice Caucasian young man that was very helpful. He scanned several shoes for us. No size 14. We continued to  look up and down the isles and found a few more we wanted to check  before giving up. Could not find the young man that helped us. 

So my husband asked this young African American young man for assistance. He decides to tell my husband , ""no I can't check. We are doing inventory so we can't pull anything from the back. "" My husband was pissed. Then what made matters worse we watched  him help another  customer and go in the back to pull them some shoes. UNBELIEVABLE. 
I had to drag my husband from the store because he was going to cuss the boy out.

I was trying to buy family disney shirts, and family, as most understand, is adults, children and toddlers.

Well, this website does not allow you to put more than one product size in a design, unless you start with the child/toddler size than you are willing to chose one of six random ""additional products"" that you wanted to buy (mine wasn't but I chose it anyway to try and keep the order going), however, it was impossible to then add the child or toddler size to the order.  So you can make an order with toddler/adult sizes or child/adult but not all three.

I called customer service for help, and this is where it all went downhill, they are no help, but were happy to inform me that I had to do things differently and don't worry, they will give me a new (much larger) quote to do the work.

At this point, I told them that what they had just said wasn't accurate about my order, and that I had no interest in purchasing from them and to not contact me.

Despite this, the woman emailed me again, actually lied about what was in my order, and continued trying to sell me something.

You can also get spur of the moment beauty help and colour matching by finding an available make up artist.

My daughter, now 6, has loved coming here since she was 4!  The girls would always ooh and ahh over her and put sparkles on her and a little blush or lip gloss.  It's really a fun place for a girly girl and I don't think any guy could go wrong getting a gift certificate for any girl in his life - be it a sister, mom, or girlfriend!

With everything from Bobbi Brown, to Benefit, to Philosphy (my husband always steals my philosphy body products) to Clarisonic skin care - Sephora pretty much has it all or has something that will suit your needs!

And don't be shy to ask for help from someone assigned to a particular department - there are loads of staff everywhere to help you find something but then there are individuals trained in particular lines of makeup that can best help you with specific questions or concerns.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"I have a pair of black jeans I've been wearing all the time for the last two and a half years. They're my all-time favorite pair of jeans; I seriously love these things. From so much wear and tear, I thought I was going to have to replace them. They had multiple tears, a belt loop was ripped off, and the zipper no longer worked. All in all, they were a mess. Despite their issues, they still fit better than any jeans I've ever owned, so I just kind of lived with it. My fear was if I took them somewhere to get fixed up they would somehow end up getting messed up beyond repair, like maybe the patches would look bad or replacing the zipper would be tricky and wouldn't quite work out. Unfortunately, it got to a point where I had no choice but to take these jeans somewhere or, dreadfully, buy a new pair. I opted to roll the dice on taking my jeans McPherson's. I drive by them almost every day, and I figured it would be as good a place as any other to take these jeans. How would I describe their work? Let me tell you, they knocked it Out. Of. The. Fucking.

I went  here one night late after work, feeling down about how my makeup had been appearing due to all the breakout I was having thanks to my diet allergies. I felt extremely self cautious at first when I arrived because literally everyone in the store has flawless skin. I started walking around the aisles of the up line makeup brands (I normally stick with drug store brands, but I needed a change!) Right away, a young girl with a beautiful smile came over and asked if I needed help. I felt at ease right away. I explained to her my situation about not getting coverage when I have an allergy outbreak and right away she belted off brands that would have full coverage yet it wouldn't make me look like I caked on a bunch of makeup to cover up. She had me sit in a chair while she searched for the right color. It took about 3-4 times to find the right shade, but my skin never has looked happier with makeup! For foundation, we went with Urban Decay All Nighter. It's waterproof but easy to wipe off with either makeup remover or a wipe. The setting powder is loose and it's by Tarte. My concealer is amazing and hides everything from a blemish to bags under the eye. This product is by Tarte as well and it's the shape tape.

I did not realize it was so poorly crafted that the lid was top heavy AND did not properly fit the top. It fell off as soon as I raised it to check the price, and shattered when it fell on the floor. I did the right thing, instead of leaving it, I brought it to the front. I was greeted by the RUDEST customer service person I've EVER met. I explained what happen and showed her how poorly it was designed and she continued to charge me! $110!!! I should've just left. She then proceeded to wrap up the broken lid after multiple times saying I did not want it as it's useless. I would have been fine, if a) she accepted equal responsibility for a poorly designed product or b) reduced it by at the min of 50% as now I have a useless overpriced small ceramic pot as its too short for flowers or c) she was kind and understanding.

The last six months that I have been going there has been very disappointing.  There is a constant turn over of employees and most of them are very rude and have no knowledge of what they are selling.  I asked for an atomizer today and she said ""what's that"".  When I showed her the old one, she said, ""Oh, we don't have those"".

Of course they don't have those.  The last four times I have been there, they haven't had anything I need so I end up buying something more expensive.  I purchased a tank two weeks ago and it won't work because the O ring broke.  I was told to go to Lowes or somewhere to purchase the O ring.  My receipt says I have 30 days to return the item if it doesn't work.  It doesn't say I have to run all over town to get what I need.  It will not work without the O ring.

It just seems like every time I go there, they never have anything in stock and I can either do without,  go out of my way to a different store or buy something that costs more!  I will say, I get waited on much faster because there are not near as many customers as there used to be.

They told us they were certain our tile was asbestos and because of that we couldn't get the hardwood we had picked because it would have to be nailed in. You can't do that with asbestos. If he had done his job we would have picked out another flooring right then and there, but instead they have lost a sale. Just out of curiosity we asked the installers to measure. The salesman hadn't even gotten the measurements right. They would not have had enough flooring to complete the job. I wasted two vacation days on these people. They have since contacted me three times. The second time I asked them not to contact me again or I would post this information online.....so here I am.

Shopping,4.5,CG,"I stopped going here a few years ago and the prices are a little higher than the other one.

I had a friend who was going to have her hair cut here and it was worth it.  It was cut in a way that was not harsh and still maintained a nice texture.  The place was clean and the owner was very helpful and knowledgeable.  She also took a look at my hair and I was happy with the result.

I also bought a wig from the shop that I had been going to for a while, which I liked, but I didn't get to try it on.  When I was doing it, I asked if it had been made by the other shop and was told it was made by another shop.  I was also told it was made by the other shop, but I was not informed of this until after I had gone back to the other shop to try it on.  I asked to speak with the owner, but she said she would not be back.

I was very disappointed that they didn't have a wig I liked, but I'm sure it will be back in about a year.  I will be going back to this shop in the future if I'm ever in the area.  I don't know if it will be in stock or not, but I hope it will"

Shopping,4.5,OR,"On my quest for shoes to wear mainly at spinning class, Bicycle Therapy really helped me out.  The staff is extremely nice, attentive, and accommodating.   The staff took their time with me to answer questions, explain things, and to make sure I was getting exactly what I wanted. 

Some places seem to get annoyed when they find out that I am getting the shoes for spin class.  Almost like I am wasting their time since  I am not ready to buy a bike and use them for that or a serious biker. However, I did not feel like that happened here at all.  The person helping me showed me the shoes I would want and what to stay away from, explained why the different shoes would be beneficial to what I wanted them for, etc.  They helped me with my clips that I would need and installed them for me.  They even told me to come back if I had any issue with anything being uncomfortable or if I needed my clips adjusted. I didn't feel like an outsider or an inconvenience here, I felt like a valued customer! I really appreciate the time he took (I was here for a while and had plenty of questions) and his willingness to help me since I really didn't know much about the product I was buying.  It was also much appreciated when he made sure I could get the colors of shoes I wanted (because of course style is important)!

Shopping,2.0,OR,"My mom and I have shopped at Night Owl for a few years and wanted to try something new. We were given different info by several people - some said you must make an appointment at Dawn's, others said it wasn't necessary. I phoned this morning to ask whether we could simply come in and shop. 
Since both my mom and I have already been fitted professionally, we did not require that service - simply wanted to buy a couple of bras. I was told that the morning was fully booked with appointments, that we would have to wait, that we would have to go one at a time when we finally did get helped, and that ""No, you may not browse the shop. A sales assistant must bring you the product to the dressing room after your fitting."" I explained that we did not need fittings, and was told that we still were not allowed to shop on our own. 
It's nice to provide personalized service to those who need it, but to forbid those who don't from looking around the shop at their leisure seems exclusive and unwelcoming. We went to Les Saisons in West Edmonton Mall instead, where we did NOT need an appointment, we had absolutely excellent service and many beautiful bras were even on sale and accessible to customers to take off racks into fitting rooms. They had a fantastic selection of gorgeous, high-end lingerie. We felt welcome and were treated with respect and a down-to-Earth manner. 
I would not recommend Dawn's. Other shops in town offer professional fitting and excellent service without making you book an appointment."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"This place always excites me and gets my mind going on planning an adventure. I was looking for a new winter coat. A very warm winter coat. I had a lot of questions and wanted to make sure I was purchasing the right coat for me. I was looking for warmth, something that didn't look hideous and was affordable. Unfortunately, a good coat is going to cost you. I did splurge a little but the sales associate did offer a variety of recommendations at different price points. 

I did find a coat that I like. It was a little on the pricey side and they didn't have my size. No worries. They ordered it for me and it will be delivered to the store. You do have the option for home shipping, but because of the area I live in I was afraid of theft so they offered to have it shipped to the store. 

A perk of REI is their membership program. It cost $20 but you will receive 10% back later in the year to spend at the store or if you wait a little longer you can cash it out. So considering I bought a coat costing more than $200 I've essentially paid off the membership and earned some rewards. 

They also have 100% satisfaction guarantee as long as it is within a year of purchase. So it this coat starts breaking down they will refund the money or exchange it. 

I'm a huge fan. I know I'll be back. Winter is coming, I love to hike, run and be outdoors so I'll definitely shop REI for gear and shoes."

This included the sheets, comforter, pillows, lamps, etc. After agreeing on a price and paying for everything we went to pick up the covers and pillows, etc. The sales guy changed what was included after We already paid so I asked for the manager. Orlando Cruz (store manager) came over and After explaining the situation, the manager lost respect for us In front of several other customers and employees. He told us that he's glad I don't make the rules, he's glad he doesn't work for me & if I don't like it I can get my money back & I can leave. His attitude and demeanor was childish and disrespectful. We went to the front to call corporate and get our money back and noticed the situation apparently became a joke around the store. We over heard other employees making comments and joking about the situation, bringing up my Arabic ethnicity, calling me dumb, etc. Several employees grouped together laughing, pointing and looking in our direction for several minutes making us feel very uncomfortable and disrespected. We went to the Brandon location to see if they had the same set because I simply don't want Orlando or Ed to be compensated for a sale from me.

Shopping,5.0,OR,"Went here today for the first time, getting a new (old) typewriter repaired.  The work was minor (just some sticking keys) and he (didn't catch his name) fixed it on the spot in just a few minutes, then gave me some tips on upkeep/maintenance.  Free of charge, at that - just said to bring it in when it breaks and there are real repairs needed.

And I definitely will.  That one interaction showed a lot of integrity and pride in his work.  Not to mention, small as the shop is, it's stacked with old typewriters.  For as long as I've wanted an old typewriter of my own (found mine as a fluke a couple weeks back), I walked in to the sight of a good dozen - priced very fairly - I've been drooling over for years now. 

If you need a typewriter fixed, this is a great place for it (not that there are too many options around).  But more importantly, if you've been dreaming of getting one, romanticizing that rhythmic clicking sans a glaring light in your face while you type, but it seems impractical... I can say since getting mine, it lives up to my expectations, and has already (even when the keys were sticking) inspired me to write more.  Get one.  And again, this is the place; Jones has many *classic* manual typewriter options (and an assortment of electrics I didn't really pay attention to), you're sure to find something perfect.

Also, note: the shop is now at 3530 Greenwood Boulevard, a few blocks south of the (old, I assume) Manchester location listed here."

I'm not a fan of the owner, but I do not think I've ever seen a negative experience there.

My husband purchased a bed here less than 4 months ago, the rails and slats of which broke while I was asleep sending me to the ground. I could have been seriously injured. The bed had been delivered and installed by the Ashley team and we were assured it was good quality. 
We went into the store with photos of the breakage and asked for a refund. The manager, John, told us we would get a refund once we contacted the customer service number. 
We followed their directictions: spoke with customer service and emailed photos. Ellie from their service department assured us we would get a refund once they reviewed the photos and would call us back in an hour. 
No one called us back, so we contacted the service number again. This time they claimed they could not do a refund and all fiscal transactions would have to go through the store. 
We returned to speak with John again, who by now changed his tune and claimed that they would not do a refund and that the service department would have do it. Then contradicting himself again, he made us move away from other customers (so they wouldn't overhear our complaints) and said that no one would give us a refund. Then he had the gall to try to sell us another bed from the store claiming that everything could have a defect and we should just deal with it. 
It was a horrible experience and we have yet to get our money back or reach a conclusion. Don't purchase the subpar furniture here!"

Shopping,3.5,OR,"Disappointing. We bought a used dryer, which works ok, but the moisture control setting doesn't seem to work (the more dry - less dry setting) - it just runs and runs and takes forever. A timed dry for the same load dried in much less time (suggesting the moisture sensor isn't working). The biggest problem is that we paid for delivery and installation when we bought the dryer ($45). They came and said it'd be $125 more to install because there weren't any hoses. They should have told us when we bought the dryer that we needed the vent and gas hoses and clamps - how would we know that! In moving into an empty house these hoses left are often not left by the former occupants - Bernie thinks differently. If we knew, we could have bought the parts for about $30. They ended up charging us $75 additional (bringing the delivery and installation fee to $120). And, Bernie argued with us that we should have known to have the hoses there. How would we have known that!? He is the expert, not us! When we bought the dryer they should have told us. The sales person and delivery/installation person were pleasant people. All their used dryers are almost $300, which doesn't seem like a bargain to me. Paint touch-ups were done with rough matt paint, not gloss like the enamel on the dryer. No telling what is under the paint. (Rust?) But, the dryer works.  Arguing with customers is not a good business practice. If they don't know what is needed, business owners should tell them up front. The delivery was done promptly."

Since it was their fault they said they would give him a replacement phone for the same cost. Seems good so far yeah?

It took 25 minutes, but that's okay because there is a TON of stuff to peruse in this store. It is actually a bit overwhelming. 

The DVD section didn't impress me much, but I was happy to see an aisle chock full of TV series. I love to binge watch TV shows. I picked up True Blood Season 6, and they had it listed for $30.95. You can buy it brand new on Amazon for $23.74. That doesn't make any sense at all... A lot of their DVDs and books are overpriced, so I headed over to the bargain section and finally found some great prices. I picked out 9 books that totaled $4.15. After my $10.78 store credit, I still have $6.63 left to spend when I go back. 

They offered $6 cash or $10 store credit for the 22 books that I brought in. Neither offer seems remotely close to fair, but I suppose it evens out when you can find a book for 10 cents in the store (which I did!).

I also had heard that they were better then Sprint and the salesmen showed me a speed test on his phone and then on my phone. I went along with it. i should have known that it took about 8 hours for my number to be ported over and for me to finally get service that this was going to be a rough ride. I was promised my company discount for the plan I got, come to find out it isn't effective on my plan, after the salesmen swore up and down it would be effective. I still haven't gotten reimbursed from T-Mobile, now my Sprint account is in collections. I have spent more time in the T-Mobile store in the past 3 months then I spent in a Sprint store my 2.5 years with them. And before I forget, if you are a returning T-Mobile customer to this store, be prepared to be treated horrible, if you are not buying anything or have no interest in helping out with the salesmen commissions, you are waisting there time.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"I brought my man here on a Groupon to check things out. I was worried about the reviews but then I looked at the yelp reviews that were hidden. I had to find out the truth for myself but luckily Michael said he would take one for the team. 

We arrived and we're greeted with a cheerful and kind crew. Including two very cute and personable dogs. I love pet friendly places, it always feels more cozy and fun. 

Mallorie got us both set up with coffee then started on Ms hair. She was very attentive to his feedback and was good with the clippers. An added bonus is that they take care of men's unruly eyebrows as a complimentary part of men's cuts. Win! 

I love the vibe here ( the music, the modern decor) and would recommend this place for someone who wants to find their regular hair place. They seem to have some loyal regulars who have discovered this gem, somewhat hidden in a strip mall on 34th. In fact, it seems like every client I saw (4) while I was waiting had been there before and had a history with their stylist. That says something. Repeat customers are a good barometer of a businesses success.

The only thing I would hesitate with is if someone were not animal friendly, then they may not like the dogs running around. But to be honest they are so friendly, they even won over a cat person.

I'd give this place more stars, but the staff is taciturn and quite unhelpful. I felt like I was bothering them the whole time. At the cash register--no hello or anything--I was setting my phone and purse down to take the contents of my basket out, and the lady didn't even wait for me to finish, she just went right in without a word and started pulling stuff out to start the paying process. I can understand trying to do your job, but she dug her hands in there while I was trying to take out the jewelry first--which a pair of earrings ended up being stuck on a scarf that I guess she missed. It was honestly rude and she seemed like she just wanted to get it over with. I'm not usually fussy about customer service and I can understand that standing for hours at a time checking people out can be taxing and tedious, but I walked out feeling uncomfortable and slightly regretting the $50 I spent here.

Shopping,2.5,OR,"The worst experience of my life at Oxford valley best buy! I needed to buy a lap top and a printer  so the first place I thought of was best buy right? WRONG. They were having some kind of special deals for students where you would get money off specific lap tops, the guy helping me told me that all lap tops over $500 was part of the deal ( every lap top I pointed out, I was asking if the deal was included because the advertising for this was hard to understand). After finding out the 3 lap tops I was interested in they didn't have in stock I settled for one that was in stock. After spending about 20 minutes trying to download the coupon onto my phone I was ready for checkout. Come to find out the coupon for the lap top I could not use. I was more then mad. A hour and a half of my time wasted in this place. I talked to the manager and explained the situation where I was under the impression I could use this coupon (I wouldn't of wasted my time if I couldn't use this coupon) he told me that he could not override the price. I told him he would rather loose a $1,000 sale then over ride a price. I left with nothing because I think this is just ridiculous. I went out in my car and called the customer service number. The guy I talked to was another waste of my time because he was not understanding what I was saying. In the end another store got my money. I will NEVER shop here again."

It was so difficult to find anything I was interested in because they all looked the same, which I understand it was a lot of what's trendy right now and I was looking for something a little different (aka not lace or a ball gown). However, their size selection was awful. I am a size 10 and they kept putting me in size 6-8 dresses which in bridal gown world is way too small. But it was my only option since about every ""plus size"" gown was pretty much a ball gown, which I didn't want. The girl was nice enough, she could tell I was unhappy but it was a really stressful appointment. No one helps you get into the gowns I was just left there to get myself into all these dresses. I kept telling the girl they were too small and that size wasn't working for me and she kept bringing them in anyway. Never in my life have I felt so fat and awful. I tried on (or attempted to) about 8 gowns in the 20-30 minutes I stayed there and only came out in 1 or 2. She had me search through the final sale racks to see if there was anything in my size I wanted to try on as a last resort. I left here in tears and to this day am still emotional about it. I left here feeling awful about myself and not like a beautiful bride which I think is just so wrong."

I told her I was a customer and had explained who I was at the beginning. I continued to explain to her my situation and told her that it's not fair no where on their receipts does it say you can't return a helium tank.

Shopping,3.5,OR,"When I walked through West Edmonton Mall and saw the 'Grand Opening' sign, I was ecstatic. Whenever I look for sunglasses, I always look at what Oakley has. They carry a huge lineup of sunglasses for fashion to active wear. I personally have one for when I'm biking, due to it's tighter arms, and another one for 'everyday' wear with a more relaxed fit. Although I do not need it myself, I appreciate how there is an 'Asian fit' style option due to the shorter noses of most Asians.

There are a few locations around Edmonton that sell Oakley sunglasses, however none have as much selection as they offer at the Oakley store. They have a lot of different frame and lens combinations, and they allow you to customize your own in your order- before you'd be at the mercy of what the other retailers would have in stock.

One thing I found annoying was how difficult it was to identify store staff. They dress 'normally' like the rest of us civilians, and a few times I found myself just talking to another customer. Regardless, when you are lucky to catch a staffer, you find they are a wealth of knowledge. They can recommend you the different types of frames you would need based on what activity you would be doing, and they also offer opinions on lenses to choose from. I even had a chance to their $4500 Elite C SIX Carbon Fiber sunglasses- it felt like nothing at all...but 'nothing at all' is exactly what would be left in my bank account if I bought them. Regardless, the staff had no hesitation showing this to me and were happy to entertain me."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"I went antique-shopping for the first time today to try and find some unique things for my new apartment, and this was the first place I visited.  It was a blast.  I had so much fun browsing all the different booths and looking at all the interesting kitchy items and trinkets and vintage furniture.  I purchased a couple small pieces of furniture and a ""chic shabby"" mirror, and I was really excited to get them in my first-ever apartment.

My enthusiasm was dampened by one of the older gentlemen, whom I assume is one of the owners, who ""helped"" load my purchases into my car.  He was terribly grouchy and unpleasant and all he really did was aggressively shove the pieces into my small sedan until the doors would close.  Albeit, my car is pretty small but the pieces were not bulky or heavy, and all you had to do was gently maneuver the pieces a bit.  Not even a minute after he closed my doors and walked away my mirror shattered! I didn't know what to do, so I went inside for some assistance, but the same guy became hostile without any provocation from me, blamed it on my small car and walked away.  I hadn't been argumentative at all, and I was a fairly shocked, at the guy's rudeness and about my brand new mirror.  Also, if he had suggested beforehand the pieces didn't really seem to fit, I would have happily returned later to ensure safe transportation, or tried to load my car myself. Lesson learned.

I would definitely visit this place again, despite the rude service, because there are some really great finds."
Shopping,2.5,OR,"I would prefer to give Gerhard's Appliances a zero star review. The one star I selected is being overly generous. We purchased multiple appliances from Gerhard's in Ardmore in July 2019. Our sales rep, Matthew Ashley, confirmed that the appliances would be held in the warehouse until we were ready for them to be delivered. Since we were completing a full kitchen renovation we didn't need the appliances delivered until mid-September. This is where everything fell apart. First, we couldn't get a return phone call from our sales rep confirming that 9/19 was an acceptable delivery date. We finally spoke to someone in delivery who confirmed we were on the schedule. The day before delivery we receive an email that lists everything to be delivered. The Bosch refrigerator and freezer columns were missing so we called to confirm this was an oversight. Nope, they just decided that no communication was better than delivering the bad news that they actually didn't have the fridge and freezer columns. 

I'm pretty sure they have a company excuse manual because I have heard just about all of them. Everything from 1) it's back ordered 2) it shipped, but the tracking number got lost 3) it's Bosch's fault.... It is now October 1 and the fridge and freezer we ordered and paid for almost three months ago has yet to be delivered and NO ONE will give me any indication as to when it will be nor will they even return a phone call.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"So I love Broad Ripple Vintage for the interactions and gems you can sometimes find.
Last time I was there and bought something (not just soaking up the character) was back in 2010 or 2011.... And one of the owners became infatuated with myself and a friend. His name was John I think? He gave us a card and wrote on it that we could have 20% off whenever we wanted. And signed it. To make it legit. He talked the Doors with us. We tried to carry on a convo only using Beatles lyrics for awhile. It was a good time.

This was a also a favorite when I was in high school. A friend of mine (back then) loved it which is funny because (at that time) she hated thrift shops... I say that's funny because I was at value Village the other day and a swarm of people I know from BRV were in there like bees. Going through racks and just grabbing tons of stuff...

I know they source things from places, but it's just funny a lot of it seems to be sourced at such a readily accessible place.

I was with my mother at VV that day and she asked the associates - who confirmed what I had already thought... So I know it was them.

So you can go to BRV and get the awesome interactions or go to where they seem to get a ton of the merchandise on their own...

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I have been to Mikes Bikes a few times now for both buying a new bike as well as some repairs. I have run into a couple of employees. Two of the three have been usually very friendly and helpful. I have gotten things fixed in as quickly as 15 minutes (e.g. failed brakes). Sometimes if it is a straightforward problem and not a busy day, they will even give you their opinion for free. Service is fairly inexpensive for the quality and efficiency. 

The one thing I do not appreciate is one of their employees is fairly slacking. I have gone into their store with an issue on an afternoon and told it would take a few hours, and hence, I should come back when I can drop my bike off for at least 24 hours. The guy refused to even look at my bike. I went in a few days later planning to drop off my bike, and his colleague took a quick look at my bike, and fixed it without even me having to drop it off or pay anything. I was fairly suprised.

On another day, I went in to look into buying a new, secondhand bike. One of the employees was fairly helpful, while the other one (same guy who had sent me away before) passed snide and unhelpful comments. Eventually I was turned off and just decided to go to another place to buy a bike. 

I would recommend to people if they find the store unhelpful, then give them a second chance, as you may just have met the wrong person behind the desk on that particular day. Overall, the store is quite helpful and does their job well."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"This place is definitely proof that looks can truly be deceiving.

Whenever I used to walk by A Mans Image I dismissed it as being drastically behind the times due to its dated look and fact that I couldn't gather much information on it online or otherwise compared to most other local clothing stores. But the more I walked by the more drawn I became to the reasonably priced designer merchandise and that were on the outdoor sales rack and window display. And upon first entry they won me over with the incredible deals and knowledgeable sales staff.

The owner is a sharp dressed old head who will be quick to tell you how he's been in the clothing business for 50+ years as he walks you through the product that best suits your style. And when it comes down to it if he can't make you look good then no one can. he knows the product he buys in seam and out, and knows when to recommend things like scotch guarding for a jacket. his family runs the business with him and he has some pretty skilled staff as well.

While some of the clothing did match the dated exterior, the store does yield a diverse amount of fashion at some pretty insane deals. designer pants went for as low as $50 for a pair of 2, and top of the lines sweaters went for as low as $30 for 2. When I  picked up a brand new winter coat the owner was even cool enough to throw in a matching scarf free of charge. Add in plenty of suits, shirts, shoes, and then some; and you have a perfect destination for good fashion on a budget."

Some of the displays in other electronics sections were broken. A lot of the cameras had dirty screens, with crusty lenses. I almost didn't want to handle them. Cmon guys really?

Shopping,2.5,OR,"Absolutely incredible service. The manager, Wesley Williams, is the man. Super helpful, nice, funny, and most importantly, upfront with you.

I went there to get my first (good) suit ahead of my first job interview. Had little to no idea on what to get. I didn't have a huge budget, and had never owned a quality suit before.

So I went in, and Wesley greeted me and started talking to me. Asked me why i was getting a new suit, what i was primarily using for, what my budget was. He selected a few suits and showed them to me. The suits are of good quality, all look really nice, and were at a reasonable price (I think my whole suit was $300). But that you can get at various suit shops. The quality of service I had however, was unique. Wesley was incredibly helpful, helped me get my measurements right, told me what would look good and what wouldn't, what traditional suits would look like v/s modern ones, what to wear with it, what to not wear with it. There were a few add ons that I was considering, that were going to be more expensive, and he told me straight up how I didn't need them and all, which, for an person who makes money on commission, says a lot about how genuine they are. He showed me a few ties that looked good with the suit i picked, and a few pairs of shoes as well.

I left the shop with the suit, tie, and pair of shoes, and a big wide smile of my face. Nailed the interview the next day and got the job too, partly thanks to my new cool looking suit and shoes."

While I was looking a woman was returning a product and the manager was just plain rude. The woman was friendly and told her she was not being confrontational but was just trying to understand their policy,  the manager still didn't get it. She just said it was too complicated to explain and it's $1.10 difference so hear you go. So sad I wanted to say something that is how poorly she treated this woman. Anyways still searching and finally settled on something. When I got ready to check out there was another girl up there helping and thankfully I got her. I asked if they could do a price check on two different items bc obviously prices weren't on the package or available where I picked the items up and the stupid manager asked if I would like to step aside and let someone else checkout. Wow! No I want a price check which the other associate did and then I was out of there. 

Afterwards my daughter and I went to Walgreens for a few things and the associate there was so friendly went out of her way to help us and at the end gave us free samples.

I told her I was looking for a gold band and she said I didn't know that. She told me that I could try on a few different bands.

Shopping,5.0,OR,"I used Savannah's Garden for the flowers for my recent wedding.  The owner, Laura, is as nice as it gets.  We met with her twice before the wedding (we picked everything out and then changed our minds entirely about the colors a few months later....sorry, Laura!) for more than an hour each time.  She was helpful and patient at both meetings.  We were able to look through many books of weddings that she had done in the past and I was able to show her a few things that I found online.

Laura had some great ideas to keep us within our budget but still get exactly what we wanted.  For example, we fell in love with a very large wooden chuppah covered in flowers that was in one of the books.  Laura designed a simpler but just as beautiful one that was much cheaper.  Even our officiant mentioned that it was one of the nicest ones he had ever seen.  In the end, it fit with our venue, the space available, and with us as a couple even better than the original one we had seen.

We gave Laura some color and flower ideas but, since I know nothing about flowers, left it primarily up to her.  The end result?  The most gorgeous bouquets, centerpieces and chuppah that I have ever seen!  They literally took my breath away.  So many of our guests commented on how beautiful they were.  

Savannah's Garden far surpassed my expectations and made our day that much more special.  I would highly recommend them for a wedding or any other occasion.  Laura's work is the best I have ever seen."

The return label didn't specify which company I should use to return the item too.  Went to drop off the item for return at my local Staples store and was told that the UPS bar code didn't scan.  I called the HSN customer service # and was told that the bar code # didn't show up.  After speaking with a manager I was told that the company that shipped the item was not affiliated with HSN and the return label should not have been included in the packaging.  I was advised to go to the USPS or UPS & pay for the shipping myself.  When I asked about reimbursement for the postage I was told that I can call the HSN customer service number after I ship the item and ask for a reimbursement.  I asked the manager for a direct number I could call or if he could email me the contact information since I was standing at the counter at Staples and had been for 25 minutes while I had been on hold.  He told me that I would just have to call the general customer service phone number on the website.  

Every time I order an item there is a return label in the event I decide to return the item.  The allure of HSN is that I can return items that I don't want with no hassle & easy convenience.

I've been to a few diff't AT&T stores in the area & this is (by far) the best one. It's NOT the closest to where I live. I actually pass up 4 other 1's to go here. The store is very clean, the employees & mngmt. seem to genuinely want to help get your questions answered correctly AND for you to leave happy. I never feel rushed when I go here. My young son, sometimes acts like a 4 yr-old boy, instead of a perfect lil angel. They don't lose their minds, but understand on some days (despite my best efforts) he gets a bit rowdy. Today was an opportunity for 1 particular employee to shine brighter than anyone else. Against my better judgment, I went to the store closest to my mother bc of an issue w/her acct (as well as my aunt's acct). They were friendly & courteous, but not as knowledgeable as required to resolve this situation. I decided to call the MVP location, where I'm used to getting VIP treatment every time [bc couldn't make it there]. I spoke with Ms. Precious for 20 minutes;  she not only answered every question I had, but also explained the reasoning behind those issues + the best way to fix them all. Precious is not only an asset to this store (on the edge of Metairie near Trader Joe's), but also to AT&T AND even more so... our society at-large. Thank you for being so awesome & we look forward to giving you All of our business + spreading the word to everyone who has any issues to resolve or looking to switch phone svcs, on whom is the most deserving/will be the most helpful to you!

Shopping,3.0,OR,"First off, there are many great things about this RC Willey - great selection, good prices, friendly service. However, their follow-up service for an order we placed recently was not great. 

My wife and I are moving into a new house in early October, and we needed a washer, dryer, refrigerator, and a new couch. We found everything we wanted at RC Willey at decent prices (Labor Day sale!), so ordered everything with plenty of lead time to get our delivery by our move-in date (couch takes 6 weeks or so). 

A few days after placing the order, we heard from our salesman that one of the fabrics we picked out was discontinued, and we needed to pick a new one. No big deal, we sent him a different choice. He told us all was fine, and we assumed our order was proceeding normally.

Then, a couple days ago, we again hear from him that the 2nd fabric we chose was also unavailable, and our couch had not even been ordered yet. This is 4.5 weeks after we placed the order. We had no idea that our couch had not even been ordered yet, and our move-in date is only a couple weeks away. This means we will not have a couch until a month after we move in. We specifically ordered the couch early, so it would be ready by our move-in date.

This is really disappointing, especially after we spent over $5,000 on furniture and appliances. We expect better customer service after spending so much money. To their credit, they did offer us a $200 gift certificate because of this, which is appreciated. But we would much rather just have a couch for our move-in date as we planned for."
Shopping,4.5,OR,"To start: I generally have no problem with Lego. I generally had no problem with this location. I have NO problem whatsoever with government Covid regulations. However, I DO have a problem with this store's manager arbitrarily deciding to shut down customer entry to the store without notice to anyone in advance or on the web, and offer curbside service ONLY to customers between Christmas and New Year's 2021. This location's manager failed to update Lego's website, Google Maps or Apple Maps or any other web source to update their changed entry status, forcing customers to make an unnecessary and wasted trip all the way to Southgate Mall only to find the place closed for in-store service, despite their advertised status to the contrary. You can't use the pick-a-brick service via curbside, it has to be done in-person or not at all. Particularly galling when this same high-handed arrogance was not a store-wide decision in Edmonton ... the West Edmonton location stayed open to customers throughout, while it respected all government occupancy limitations. Not so with the Southgate manager who merely offered excuses over the phone and explained their arbitrary ""abundance of caution"" all away with ""Oh we don't have control over the Lego website"" (even though ANY member of the public can update opening hours information on Google and Apple Maps). What self-respecting and reasonably-competent store manager runs a business like this? I remain sceptical that this incompetent manager was more intent on limiting their location's Christmas returns of Lego sets than protecting the public from Covid out of an ""abundance of caution"". Yes, I am indeed upset at wasting a trip to Southgate after a long drive. So much so that I will never patronise this location again."

Shopping,5.0,OR,"First off, this place is beautiful and continues to make improvements. Over the year that passed from when we booked the venue to the date of our wedding, several new structures were built and decorations added. It is truly gorgeous. You need to provide minimal decorations yourself -- we just brought a few things for the tables. 

This place is a well-oiled wedding machine. There are pros and cons to this. 

Pros: They know what they're doing. They have plans A, B, and C covered. They've done this a zillion times and they know what can go wrong and what to look out for. You definitely feel like they have everything under control during the rehearsal and the wedding day itself. You don't have to think about or worry about anything. This is invaluable.

Cons: Sometimes I felt like just another money-making bride being thrown into the machine. Communication is sometimes weak, especially if your wedding date is not approaching soon. If you are trying to plan ahead for your wedding, it can be tough to get in touch with anyone from the venue until you are about a month or so away -- I assume this is because they are busy with other brides and not ready to focus on your wedding yet. I had periods of time where my emails went unanswered for 40-50 days, or when I (for example) scheduled a rehearsal on the phone and then later got an email asking when I'd like to schedule my rehearsal. That part can be frustrating. 

Overall though I would recommend this venue. It is pricey but worth it. Certainly the most gorgeous and convenient place I have ever seen for a wedding and I was lucky to have mine there."

The place is large, and they seem to have a pretty good selection.  That's pretty much where the positive comments end.  I've not once picked out anything they had in stock, and it has taken weeks to get even the most basic of products.  The salespeople's helpfulness and attitude vary widely.  One two occasions they called me to come in and pick up the tile that had arrived, only to find out once I got there that the tile was not there...or they possibly gave it to someone else, who knows.  Additionally, despite the fact they might be open to a certain hour, it's functionally useless since the ""warehouse"" guy leaves an hour to two hours before the store closes.  So, I kid you not, if you find something you want to buy...they won't get it for you, and won't sell it to you.  I actually needed to pickup 15 pieces of bullnose tile, and BROUGHT IT TO THE COUNTER MYSELF...and they wouldn't sell it to me, because it ""wasn't in their job description.""  Really...I'm not kidding.  Must be a union thing, I'm not sure.  

At any rate, I got what I needed, but doubt I'll go back; I don't much trust a company that won't sell you what's sitting in front of them, because the warehouse guy left.  Very poor customer service overall.

I called Tracphone and they had no idea what she was talking about.  I spoke with (3) different people and all of them said that what she was suggesting would not work and just didn't make sense.

You would think they would take care of customers in that referral stream. We hired them to moved several pieces of furniture from our brand new condominium to storage. 

When I booked the move, I explained that the condo had just been finished being built, all the finishes were brand new and I requested that they send an experienced crew that would take great care with our home. Instead they sent a two man crew, one of which complained he was injured and couldn't work and spent the entire time on his cell phone leaving the other guy to do most of the work. 

Moving a bookcase they scraped our brand new hardwood floor with a huge two inch series of divits in the floor finish. This in a room we hadn't even had the chance to use yet. When I called to complain I was told that they had had several complaints against that employee and were planning on firing him after my job. He never should have been sent on our job obviously.

It took three weeks to get the moving company's repair person out to fix the floor and they did a horrible job. I was told they didn't have anyone else to fix it and I was on my own. I hired another company to come out to try to repair it and it looks better but is still quite obvious and visible.

Shopping,5.0,OR,"Thanks to a spiffy-sounding deal on LivingSocial, my beau and I got to attend a glassmaking workshop with another couple... yay for a double date!  There were different workshops you could choose from, and since we had zero-zilch-nada glassmaking experience, we went for the super-beginner ""Design a pendant workshop."" For the four of us, Jim blocked out two hours for us, which was the perfect amount of time to get comfortable with the basics and complete our projects.

We started off by Jim giving us safety tips, he explained the materials and tools, and then he created a pendant first and walked us through the process while we all watched. And then, one by one, each of us made our own!  

I cannot express to you how freakin' rad it is to work with a 3000-degree flame and creating something unique. There's also a very peaceful, zen-like quality to it... when you're working with the glass, that's the only thing you're thinking about. You're not dicking with your phone, you're not thinking about your electric bill; you're just present and in the moment...  it's a beautiful thing.

Anyway, as if all of these other 5-star reviews aren't enough to convince you, take my word for it: Jim and his classes are AMAZING, and this makes the perfect gift. Whether you're flying solo, you want to get Mom a cool treat, you wanna do something different for date night... Jim Loewer Glass is the way to go.

We definitely got the glassmaking bug and can't wait to take other classes!

He said we needed a whole new set. Service center called and said they would help us by replacing some of the parts but there was nothing they could do now. I told them what Mike said and was told that this was the Techs opinion and that it is up to another team to review his write up and determine what needs to be done.

Cut to 30 years later and, after exploring most of the other shops in town, I always find myself back at Second Amendment. From hunting to plinking to long range work, I can't think of the last time they didn't have what I needed. 

There's so many staff at 2A that are fantastic, it's hard to name them all. The girls in the back are always awesome with the NICS forms (they'll only bust your b***s a little bit if you mess up, don't worry). Shoutout to Robert for turning me from a ridiculous Glock fanboy onto my now-edc Walther PPQ (my wife wasn't a fan considering I proceeded to buy maybe a few... or maybe several more... Walthers afterwards. Then I got her a CCP, and well, look who's out of the doghouse now). So thanks for that, Robert. Seriously, the guy is passionate about helping you find the right firearm for your needs. Also, Gary in optics was awesome helping me find am irregular sized objective lens cover recently. I'd had all sorts of trouble finding the right size, so I walk into 2A, and Gary starts popping open boxes of Butler Creeks and maybe 30 seconds later finds exactly what I needed. 

These guys will go out of their way to help, that's what I love most about 2A. Ill be a customer for another 30 years, at least. And with a baby son on the way, rest assured he'll be a third generation 2A customer... No doubt."

Today I got home from work around 540 and was parked half in front of the passenger loading zone in front of the pharmacy. The owner comes out and tells me that if I am not shopping at his pharmacy he is calling the PPA on me. I pointed out that it was a 20 min loading zone until 6pm and it was 540pm. I told him I have shopped there several times and have told various neighbors about it. He said it doesn't matter and he was calling then PPA and was quite rude and confrontational about it (which even if he called the PPA they couldn't have ticketed me as I was within the 20 min until 6pm when the parking restrictions end and they don't ask for a recipe of purchase).

He has now lost me as a customer and I will make sure to tell my friends as well. The amount of money he lost by being rude over 20 minutes of parking far outweighs his efforts of going out of his way to get me a ticket from the PPA. I ended up moving my car which I'm sure right after I left someone took anyways because I didn't feel like dealing with the hassle.

Right off the bat I noticed my rear brake pad was completely worn, something that you should make sure is good if you are a dealership reselling a vehicle. I confronted them about it, they solved the problem for me. I appreciated that. A week ago I went in and bought 2 brand new tires for my motorcycle. They are the ""home of the free tire install"" as well. I called to get an appointment to get them installed. They told me they do not do service on Moto Guzzi. I was baffled, so I decided to go in person. They explained that they had a lawsuit with a customer over a bad job they did and that person sued them. So they no longer do service on the bike I bought from them and can't install the tires on my bike that I just bought. I am extremely annoyed at this point and I got a refund on the tires. They apologized and the employees were obliviously annoyed by the inter workings of their own company. One employee said that was not the first time the ""service department"" had screwed them over. The service department was extremely rude on the phone. He even asked me if my ""Moto Guzzi"" was a scooter? Honestly insulted me. They did not resolve the problem either.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"I like the idea of the Idea Hatchery. This stretch of Woodland is full of 'hidden' businesses that blend in with the older homes on the street. Because of the name, I guessed the Idea Hatchery was a shared workspace or a writing collective. It *only* took me [redacted] years to get out of my car and walk in to see what's what.

Flanked by an antiques shop and an art gallery (if you've done Tomato Arts Fest you know right where this is), the collective's appearance is a bit nondescript but that makes the discovery all the better, no? Inside the threshold are eight uniquely (east) Nashville businesses. As an incubator, the Hatchery is a perfect spot to test out concepts and gain sea legs before opting for a bigger location or an expanded footprint. It's a great go-between from online/out of the house to stand alone brick and mortar. I believe this is the spiritual parent to the Shoppes on Fatherland. Right now the current occupants tend to skew a bit 'female' in what they do (fashion, art, etc.) but that's not to say that there isn't a lot for a number of demographics to choose from. Selfishly, I'm hoping that some sort of food/treat business takes up residence in the shops. Toffee? Taffy? Shaved Ice? I can keep going folks. Actually, an old-timey, regional candy store would fit in well. Boom. I just found your newest tenant. Sort of.

East End has a lot of fun businesses to explore. Next time you're in the neighborhood, scoot just a bit past that (locally) famous intersection and get a taste of what the area has to offer.

Shopping,3.0,OR,"On two occasions, for the same issue, I visited this AT&T store in Phoenixville to get help, and both times I was seriously impressed with the customer service.

I stopped in the first time because my newish flip phone (no, this is not an oxymoron) was goin' nuts, obsessively autodialing whoever was the last person I'd called, to the point where one of my clients asked me to just...stop...calling. That said, it was impossible to make or receive calls on purpose, because there was no audio, so I could only text. Zach M. quickly diagnosed the second problem--dead microphone--and said (cheerfully) that yes, I could substitute a cheap AT&T go-phone that I already owned for my now-only-half-functional flip phone (to solve the first problem). What's more, he also located a cheaper plan for my needs.

On the second visit, I brought the go-phone to the store, and Shannon just as cheerfully changed out the phones and uploaded my contact list to the new phone. (Unfortunately, only half the contacts got loaded, but that was probably a phone thing rather than a customer service issue.)

Anyway, both Zach and Shannon were extremely polite and professional, and I was willing to go back the second time even though Phoenixville is waaay out of my way. Whoo!

Btw, the reason I felt compelled to write this review was that, a few days before I set foot in this store, I visited a different AT&T store on Concord Pike in Wilmington, and the two employees there wouldn't even look at my phone because it was six weeks out of warranty. They were very pushily trying to get me to buy a new (expensive-ish) phone, with a new plan. After that experience, I was thinking of switching carriers if I could find a better deal.

Anyway, kudos to the Phoenixville crew."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"So, I don't have much to compare Portside Parlor to, as this was my first tattoo experience, but the bar has been set pretty high. After years of talking about getting tattoos, my wife and I finally decided to take the leap. We walked in on Saturday afternoon, unsure of what to expect, and were VERY pleased with the experience, from beginning to end.

We were very upfront with the receptionist (Lauren, I believe) that we weren't real sure of the process, didn't have appointments, etc. and she was very pleasant, explained everything, took a look at what we wanted done, got us price quotes and let us know they could get us in right then. Amazingly easy!

After filling out all of our paperwork, we went back and met Rebecca (our artist for the day) and got started. She was, in a word, amazing. Very friendly, explained everything as she went and was very non-judgemental about the lack of ""art"" in our designs. We both had one-color, text-based designs, and instead of being annoyed that there wasn't much creativity involved she told us how much she liked doing this sort of thing because it helps her keep her technical skills sharp. Both she and Lauren made us comfortable from the beginning, and we never felt out of place, despite it being our first tattoos. Most importantly, neither of us could be happier with the final product.

The shop itself is pretty great - extremely clean, paintings on the wall to purchase, spacious waiting area with hardwood floors...certainly not the stereotypical dark, dingy tattoo parlors you see in the movies.

I'm not sure if he's too old for the store or just didn't want to wear them. We had a great experience with this location. I'm glad I stopped in and found out they have a separate location. I went in to pick up a pair of sunglasses and was told they wouldn't be able to fit my face. I was told that they could fit my face, but that I couldn't wear them. I asked to speak with a manager and he said they don't carry sunglasses at all. I was told that it's not their policy to make glasses at the store. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that they couldn't help me because my insurance doesn't cover glasses.

get away from it all for a couple days and she found the Van Gogh experience. Perfect! I get to be the doughing hubby for the day and fain interest. 

The Stanhope set was awesome. Cleaver. Smart. Hilarious. Comedians truly are the insight of society. 

Back to the museum. We arrived around noon. We were starving. We go to the cafeteria for some lunch. She stares at the menu. She, as always, couldn't decide. After 30 seconds, ""Get on with it,"" I say. It's our little banter. 
""Relax."" The male attendant says. ""The only one in a rush is you."" 

There's this joke at the Stanhope show which people got mad but then they  realized choking out the host wasn't going to solve anything.

I order the panini sandwich. Can't go wrong. Some meats. Cheese. A bit of mustard. Grilled. Five minutes later the server says, ""I have the chicken salad for the lady and the Peanut Butter and Jelly for the gentleman.""  
""I had the panini?"" 
Awkward pause. She realized the delivery was wrong.
""Sorry. I'll be back.""   

I got a great photo with Junior Stopka after the show. He got vaccinated and now has autism. 

I eventually got my panini and it was terrible. Even the wife was disappointed and she's tolerates me. 
The Van Gogh exhibit itself was very well done. The experience is memorable. So memorable that the babies that were there crying and being psycho-emotional added to the mental state that Van Gogh had to go through.

The bonus was I went from Van Gogh in the afternoon to Stanhope at night. Find your happiness people. It's just a ride."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"As a new resident of Tampa, I was surprised that there are no Uni K Wax franchises in the area!  My friend referred me to European Wax Center, and I had a wonderful waxing experience.  I was slightly stressed trying to find a suitable new waxing place, and I'm glad that I took a chance on EWC.

I made an appointment online and luckily, this location is a few minutes drive from my house.  The girl at the desk was really nice, even though she was the only one working (there are usually 2), and there were a lot of other customers in the store (which is a good sign that it's a popular location).

I had Courtney as my technician.  She led me to a private room with its own door, so you have total privacy for your service.  She was very nice and talked me through the procedure, even though I am experienced with waxing.  It shows her professionalism and that she cares about customer experience.  She was very deft at waxing, and I was done quickly.  I had an excellent experience and no hair left behind!

You earn more Strut Points if you book your next appointment in-house, rather than online, so I booked my next wax on the spot.  You can go online and change your date, which was a relief because I like to keep my calendar open.  My friend got $10 in referral money because I mentioned her name.  And I received 50% off of my service as a first time customer.  Excellent!

After an hour and a half passes the gentleman calls me up to tell me that I let it go too long and my front pads were gone, all my calipers were ruined, all four of my rotors were ruined and apparently my struts were OE (though I had custom struts put on a few years prior to make it ride like a cloud which it does mmmm) and needed changed due to my mileage.  I did not disclose to them that I was a mechanic myself and was too lazy to do the work, having more money than free time.  I was quoted roughly $1600 dollars to do the repairs I laughed told him to wrap it up and I would do it myself.  Got home put it up on the racks and took the tires off to find that my rotors were fine, as suspected my front rotors needed spun but were still rather new.  My back brake pads weren't even worn down, they were at 50% or more and my back rotor was flat as a 18 year old gymnast.  I can say I do not appreciate being fibbed to, I don't believe it was intentional but the result of poor training.

Shopping,1.5,OR,"I went into this Lowe's requiring a fairly simple service: I needed to purchase a sheet of glass, cut into two smaller sections. 

Having to wait for an available employee to find someone who knew how to cut the glass was no problem, I expect that sort of thing. When the appropriate employee was found, he made it very clear he did not want to be helping me (his exact words were ""I hate cutting glass""). He did not wear protective equipment of any sort. He worked quickly, needing to score the sheet several times before he was able to make the cut. He dropped the piece at one point. He sliced his finger and bled profusely over the wrappings he was placing the glass on. He then used his bare hand to wipe at some of the blood streaks, smearing them excessively, before shrugging, taping up the bloodied paper, and handing me the bundle. 

I was too stunned to say anything. The guy was clearly disgruntled and I was afraid declining the glass after his ordeal would cause a conflict I didn't want to deal with, so I just took the pieces and (carefully!) went home. 

The purchase ended up costing me twice what I had calculated it would be; I don't know why he didn't realize he could use a smaller sheet of glass rather than making multiple cuts in this big sheet. 

When I got home, I carefully opened the bloody paper to find that there were already spider cracks forming along the roughly cut edges of the glass. It was unuseable. I re-taped the bloody paper and back to Lowe's it went.

The only reason this store gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the cashier who handled my return seemed appropriately mortified and apologized profusely while doing a very efficient refund."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I love to read. I loved it as a kid and got so excited for the local library's summer reading program. Although I've gotten busier over the years and haven't had as much time as I like to read for pleasure, I always make time for books. Reading is fundamental and a lifelong hobby.

I was shocked to find out 1 in 5 people in the central Indiana area read at a sixth grade reading level or below. Indy Reads, a local literacy organization that's been around for 30 years, wants to change that. Their gracious volunteers work one-on-one with adults to increase their reading skills! (Psst: they're always looking for more help!) 

Indy Reads Books is the three-year-old Mass Ave bookstore that supports Indy Reads' mission. It's tucked away at the very north end of Mass Ave, with their own (free!) parking lot. This bookstore to me is like a more charming, more rustic, local version of Half Price Books. You never know what you'll find, and most DVDs/CDs/books/etc. are priced reasonably, under $10-$15 (except for signed copies and brand new copies). Cute chalkboard signs indicate the section of books. They also have two adorable nooks in the back for working! Not to mention a stage area where authors can read from. It's storytime, y'all!

My selection for the day was Indy Writes Books, an anthology of local authors sharing short stories, poems and more. John Green contributed three previously unpublished stories! For $25, you get a great piece of work and all the proceeds go to Indy Reads. Makes a great gift! I've already started reading it and it's a great diversity of genres and styles.

Can't wait for many repeat trips to Indy Reads to explore and browse around. Show some love to your local bookstore! I know where I'll be donating my books from now on!"

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by sales rep. Anthony Boyd. Definitely a God send after our experience with Ashley Furniture in Avon. We looked around for awhile and decided on living room furniture along with some other pieces for my new home. He was so helpful and made the process smooth.

I got burned with my delivery date with Ashley but he reassured me I'd have it the day after Christmas. I was so happy... I almost made him write that promise in blood (lol) but the paperwork was enough. I will do a follow up review after we get our furniture but so far so good!

Anthony definitely earned our business and I'm glad I made the trip out there. I still have to deal with the inconvenience of Ashley (my $1k deposit won't be refunded for 7-10 business days) but at this point I'm just glad we have something to sit on before the new year. 

This location has a good selection of furniture and I like the fact they had really nice clearance furniture. I was a little hesitant about this location due to some of the reviews but my experience in Avon was cool so I decided to try them again. 

I also like the fact they have a warehouse locally which more than likely gave me a better chance of getting my furniture sooner than later...

The whole staff was nice and they didn't know about my Ashley experience or me being a Yelper. Thank you Anthony and Godby...looking forward to enjoying my furniture!"

Shopping,4.0,OR,"Mr. Harlow,

You are a very unethical businessman and person. What you have been told by Tom is a lie and he knows it. You both will have to answer to your consciences.  I know the truth and as God as my witness I did in no way lead Tom into believing I wanted the putting green covered by rock. During our walk through it was specifically shown to him what I wanted done to the small patch of worn chip green and no discussion of the current condition of the putting green was ever discussed. He made a mistake and is unwilling to admit it or his orders to the maintenance people were misinterpreted and he is covering for them. For you to infer the condition of the putting green demanded rock coverage is laughable.Thinking that you were a reasonable man and businessman I wasted my last two Thursdays getting estimates as I was willing to split the cost of replacement of the putting green. From the tone of your email it seems that you are unwilling to budge from the supposition that Tom may in fact errored in performing my request. The wording of your estimate says to remove the putting green ""area"" not the putting green period. That wording and Tom taking a sworn oath of truth is what is up for debate in a court of law. Send me a very detailed itemized bill and I will pay what I owe. As much as I would love to have my day in court to expose your dishonesty my time will not allow it. Upon receipt of your bill I will come to your business and give you a certified check in exchange for the final lien waiver release.

Shopping,4.0,OR,"I wanted to do dinner at the Varsity Club Restaurant on the Club Level before the Bulls game last night - I would have given the experience a 5 star with one exception. 

The Banker's Life Fieldhouse website is NOT very user friendly.  The links work, it's easy to find, etc. but they have a huge amount of information under the ""Fan Guide"" tab that seems to have no rhyme or reason to it - it took a lot of hunting to figure out who to call to get a reservation and to figure out the name of the restaurant in the Fieldhouse that we were trying to get into.

Other than that, our experience was great!  The woman who was working security at the Pacers gift shop entrance was animated, happy and welcoming - like she was actually having fun with doing the whole security thing - it sounds silly but it took something invasive and made it into a positive experience - it's great when people have a fun attitude towards their work - especially when the ""work"" is dealing with a crush of humanity eager to get inside and out of the cold!

The dinner at the Varsity Club (which is a buffet) was expensive, but the offerings were varied and there was definitely something there for just about every taste palate.  I enjoyed everything I sampled with one exception, a grilled chicken dish that was a little overcooked - dried out.  Everything else was great - we had a great waiter and AMAZING seats looking over the rail.  Being able to have dinner and watch the game at the same time was a lot of fun.

This place brought such nostalgia to me, being the proud 80's baby over here, this arcade brought me back to the times of Nintendo when you had to blow on the cartridge until you got dizzy just to get it to work..and don't let it freeze in the middle of your game!!

Ah yess the good ole days, the times when we were fascinated by Dreamcast cause you could play with 4 players at the same time. The time when you could go over your neighbors house cause they had the latest gaming system. The invention of Sega Genesis with the original sonic. The discovery of GameCube with the controller that vibrated. Yes that was my childhood and Pinball Gallery delivered it all and that's why this place deserves all five stars!

We arrived on a Saturday evening and was greeted by a friendly lady who presented us with our options of how long we wanted to play and the cost. I choose 8.00 each for one hour, but the lady was so super friendly that she didn't even kick us out  when we exceeded our time lol. The place was clean with a good amount of pinball machines. The friendly lady took her time to show my nephew how to play pinball. The pinball machines were all classics of Ghostbusters, Rocky Bullwinkle and the hobbit.

Any who, I call Toyota, get in hold with people I need to fix, how hard could it be? Just re-instate my service plan I paid for, the premium, or give me my money back. It has now been since August, they told me in September it was fixed, and the new correct contract with the premium is on its way. 4 weeks later, nothing. Ok, I'll take my car in to Toyota to see if the service dept can look it up on their end (how I found out about all of this). 
The service dept tells me that now everything has been cancelled, and I have no services, even the basic plan has been cancelled. Now, the finance people I was in contact with won't return my calls or my emails. 
I like Toyota, my car is great, but I had enough of this kind of service with Dodge. 
Should of double checked, and it would all be good. But now they can't or won't fix an easy thing. I still have all my old contracts to prove it, but nothing."

Well check out Simply ChIc then!   Run, don't walk to this little gem. I had been meaning to stop in after a co-worker said she scored a Coach purse and Uggs here. So on my way home I decided why not as I was in search of a cute black purse. I had checked out a couple of major retailers last week and just refused to pay a lot of $$$ for a new purse. Now I started in the accessories because I love cute jewelry. Not the type that will have you wondering if I was a celebrity because I definitely am not that famous ;) but the cute type of accessories that makes you pause and say ""Oh that's a cute look!""

After finding some cute Valentine's themed earrings I saw my new love. She was on the shelf discreetly cslling my name, standing proudly amoung many beautiful bags. The nice lady working in the store, that was super friendly and probably as much as a shop to you drop diva as I, put the beauty in my hands for closer inspection furthering my love from afar. Yes this baby was gonna be mine if the price was right. And by golly gee whiz it was!  Cha ching ring that sweet thing up right now.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"This is by far my FAVORITE nursery. I recently got really into house plants since I live in an apartment and don't have a yard of my own. I found this place through Yelp and was very happy I went to check it out.

It is located in the Seminole heights are and from the outside you may miss it the first time you drive by. They have a small parking area but it is located by other businesses and is in easy walking distance if you are already in the area.

When you walk in, you feel like you are entering a jungle. Every place you look is the perfect spot for a sassy photo op. The staff is super friendly and always is eager to help you find the perfect plant for your space.

As for the plants. This place has everything you can think of. From ferns to peperomias to succulents, there is a plant for everyone. I was greeted by one of the employees who literally spent an hour with me trying to find what I was looking for and we did. I was very indecisive but the whole time the employee had a smile on her face and continued to strike up a conversation. I always manage to walk out with the plant I want and a plant that I didn't know I needed until I got there.

While I am not getting married any time soon, this place does do orders for wedding plants as well as photo shoots. They also offer landscaping for houses and businesses. I am almost certain they are going to open a second shop in St. Pete which is awesome!

This is a great place to explore and stroll around in. If you buy a pot and plant they will even pot it for you in the store so you don't have to worry about getting your home dirty!"

I probably won't come back to this place again unless I am looking for something very specific. The warehouse is not in Fishtown, its in Kensington, which is close, but very different neighborhoods. The staff is super friendly and down to earth and the warehouse pets (cats and dog) are very cute.  That being said,  the place is filthy and hot.  I love kitties and doggies as much as anyone but I'd prefer to not have cats laying all over the clothes I intend to buy and resell.  Obviously, everything will get washed but some people have pretty severe pet allergies.   The prices were not great..ok, not great.  I found a couple of vintage dresses for $25 each.  Not really a bargain.  All in all, it was not a wonderful experience.  I have found better deals at Goodwill and Estate Sales, which offer a climate controlled environment, items hung on racks with very little damage and no real need to clean and sterilize immediately.  If you are looking for something for yourself, great!  This place may be what you're looking for.  If you are a business owner, don't bother. I was charged 13% to use my debit card.  In hind sight, I probably should have just put back the other items I had that were not all that special and saved myself $75. The digging through boxes is ok but HARD work!!

My friend and I paid $500 plus tip, pricey, and unfortunately the confirmation of one of us being able to join in the cave session was cancelled during the down time between our services due to poor communication.
My friend enjoyed her deep tissue massage but the gal who did her facial was a different person and she didn't like the facial, of lack of, from her at all. It was a series of several face washes and neck, arm, foot massage. Facial was only 25% of the time. My friend was so confused with the service as she just finished a massage and wanted a facial.

The store full of people is awkward when you are leaving your massage to another service in your robe, especially if you need to use the restroom as it's a public restroom on the other side of the store.

It would be helpful to get a tour of lounge, restroom, cave, etc before services so we know what we are doing and where we are going, wear our shoes, or know where to carry our basket of belongings.
When the problems were brought to the staffs attention it was deflected and staff played ignorant.  

After we left, the manager called and left a lengthy message. Too little, too late as we spent a good part of the day there with weird downtime and we were on a relax mommy get away weekend with no extra time for them to make it right.

My husband and I stopped in to the showroom on a Monday evening looking for a new couch.  We were promptly greeted by a salesperson, Ivan.  He immediately asked us if we needed any assistance and we told him we were just browsing.

We were vacillating between 2 options that were very different.  While discussing, Ivan popped up and offered to price out both options to assist with the decision.  This was exactly what we needed!  Ivan was extremely helpful, without being intrusive.  

We settled on our preferred option and went through the steps of purchasing.  Ivan was amiable and peppered in some personal conversation while we were waiting for things to finalize.

I was surprised when I was told that we could have the furniture delivered that same week on Thursday.  We were given a delivery window of 7a-10p so I requested that a note be made on the account to call when they were close to the house so I could step out of work to meet them.

The only negative instance was the delivery driver called my house phone instead of my cell, but thankfully I spend my day anticipating needs so I assumed that there may be a mix-up with the numbers and had already forwarded my house phone to my office.

The delivery men were both very pleasant and helpful and were in and out in less than an hour.

Right from the start I made the purpose of my visit to this store clear and respectfully inquired if they had a few minutes to spare to help me out. I noted that by no means were they obligated to help, but that I would be very appreciative if they would be able to do so. There was one customer in the store, and a staff consisting of what appeared to be an older man, younger man, and older woman.

I was met with obvious looks of irritation, and the older man I was speaking to very begrudgingly placed a ring on the counter. He looked off to the side with a look of annoyance as I spoke to him, and whenever I tried to ask him any questions he would bluntly respond with a disdainful tone and expression that made it obvious that he thought I was just a waste of his time. 

After spending a minute getting virtually no information about the piece, he dismissively said I should just go to some other jewelry store instead to get information about some other piece because ""he had work to do."" He promptly indicated that I should go, at which point I politely left. As an additional kicker I realized a minute after I had left the paper with the instructions for my assignment with them, and went back to retrieve it. I was told rather indifferently by the younger man there that they had shredded it.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I'm obsessed with Southern Paws! I make it a habit to find a pet store whenever I travel as I feel guilty for leaving my two pups at home in San Diego and always want to bring them a treat as a peace offering. When I stumbled upon this adorable store in the French Quarter, I made a mental note to return before wrapping up my visit to New Orleans. On my final night, I popped in and was immediately impressed with the selection of treats, toys and other pet-related goodies. The hardest part was narrowing down the options as there were so many things that I wanted for my girls!

Since my pug is quite the fashionista, I ended up getting her a ""laissez le bon temps rouler"" purple dress. I debated whether the extra large would fit her as she's usually a medium in Petco dresses but the sizing wasn't too far off. I think a large would have fit slightly better as the extra large was a little long for her but the large was sold out. It was a little stressful buying from a store 1,800 miles away but I took a gamble and it paid off!

For my mastiff, I decided on a stuffed alligator toy with a squeaker. She's not as fond of dresses as her sister and I figured it would be even more of a risk to find the right size for her 105-pound frame. She does, however, love stuffed animals and has been having a great time playing with her gator over the past month.

I also chose two cookies, which were big hits and gone quickly. The woman working the register was helpful in assisting me with choosing the right treat and size for the dress.

I highly recommend that all pet owners stop into this store to spoil their pups with treats and toys as there's no doubt that our fur babies deserve it!"

We finally had all the correct measurements and he failed to select the correct shade of carpet that we asked for and were standing there holding. We borrowed a truck to pick up this carpet (which we waited over 2 hours for in the store), and contacted Raymond Williams to install the carpet. The carpet was fully wrapped so we could not see that the carpet was the wrong color. He installed the carpet on 06/05/2020. When I came home from work that day, I went upstairs to find the wrong shade of carpet had been installed. I told Raymond to stop, because he was installing the incorrect shade of carpet. I ran to Menard's to see what could be done. I ended up purchasing the correct carpet and now my living room has no carpet, but does have tack strip laid. This has brought injury to myself, my family, and my pets. I now have to wait another 2 weeks to receive the correct carpet, and schedule another installation date with Raymond and pay him to install the correct carpet and borrow a pickup truck again to pick up the correct carpet. 

I wrote in using their contracted complaint form which I had to mail in, and they refused to refund us for the instillation. 

This place is a joke, I will never order anything from them again."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"When you think Tiffany and Co, doesn't the words classic and timeless come to mind?
Immortalized to many by the famous Audrey Hepburn, the iconic pieces of Tiffany and Co would most likely be their classic setting engagement rings and the key pendants.

When we had discovered Tiffany would be opening at West Edmonton mall earlier in the year while visiting the Calgary location, I couldn't help but get misty eyed thinking about how special it would be to dress up a little nicer and casually browse the collection like Audrey's character.

We finally had a chance to begin a tradition of visiting Tiffany's once a year to look at their collections and to have our own Tiffany rings cleaned.

When inquiring about our rings to be cleaned (I had initially stated our rings were purchased from Tiffany's) the salesperson quickly looked at my ring and responded curtly that Tiffany's does not clean Louis Vuitton rings. Now, I'm not sure if it's because I had my wallet on the counter but I have no idea why they would say that and in a cold manner. What's even more strange was the ring is from the Atlus line which the sales team should be fully aware of. You wouldn't expect a BMW salesman to decline to service your car stating they don't service Mercedes when you bring in a BMW 3 series.

Needless to say, once they realized both rings were from Tiffany's, they could not provide an approximate time to pick up our rings other than ""in a few hours"". I was even more surprised that after a few hours of walking around the mall, they did not call to request us to pick up our rings.

The highlight, however, was upon returning to Tiffany's we had a completely different experience with a different salesperson; they were cheerful, friendly and nice. When asked where I would pay the cleaning services, they simply said it was complimentary this time."

Shopping,4.0,OR,"So I caved and went in again looking for a winter jacket for my dog. I also thought maybe I was being overly sensitive about them treating my partner and I badly. The verdict is that when I'm there alone the staff are friendly and when we've been in as a couple the staff are HORRIBLE to us. Anyway, besides that, the latest time I was there two employees were *very* loudly yelling -err 'conversing'- about how the one employees ex girlfriend wants child support and how he thinks he should be able to hit their children as punishment and she has no right to say anything because he is the 'breadwinner'. The other employee was agreeing with him (loudly saying things like 'don't let her tell you what you can and can't do with YOUR children' and 'you are the man and you make the money so you call the shots'). They were talking very loudly, to the point where the guy was freaking out, yelling and swearing and asking his coworker/family member to talk to his mom and also to 'shake his ex up' a bit. So obviously there are some family members hired within this family-owned and operated business which is great unless you have some major family issues that need to be addressed. So I'm there in the collar and leash section listening to all this thinking 'honestly WTF' and another costumer looks at me like 'is this really happening?' and I say out loud to her 'this store is always kind of weird'. There were a handful of other employees around, who could all obviously hear this super inappropriate exchange going on and no one said anything. I couldn't believe the whole scenario and found it pretty disturbing. I did buy a dog jacket because the prices were quite a bit cheaper for the same item than elsewhere and I felt I couldn't afford not to."

Shopping,1.5,OR,"I ordered a couch on Labor Day 2020. The deal was fantastic and the couch was exactly what I wanted. I was so excited about this purchase. We paid with credit card which was immediately charged even though we were told delivery would be between 6-8 weeks because of COVID backlogs. I understood this and wasn't upset at the expected delivery timeframe. 
In October I called to get an update on the delivery date. At first no one answered my call and there was no option for a message, so it just rang for 20 minutes. I tried multiple times that day to get through to someone. Eventually I had to drive 55 minutes to the store to actually speak with someone. I was told they needed to email buying department to get the update, and they would call me later. I drove 55 minutes for them to send an email. I was frustrated. Finally I received a call that my delivery was pushed to the middle of December. This was tolerable for me but annoying that I had to seek out this update. It would have been nice to have them reach out with this pushback. 
In the middle of December I hadn't heard anything so I called again. They emailed buying and called me back to let me know it now won't be delivered until the end of February or beginning of March. 6 months was too long for me to wait for this couch so I cancelled the order. They refunded the entire order. 
Very disappointed with this process. They had our money from day 1 and it felt like I was being misled. Understanding that COVID created issues, but I feel like it would have been courteous to reach out to inform me of all of these changes; especially because a 6-8 week order turned into over 20 weeks. 
Because of this experience, I will not order from Ashley again."

I am updating my review. 

My two front tires were balding. I decided to go to El Tingon to get two used tires as a temporary fix instead of buying two new ones. They quoted me $50 a tire, which is way more than the usual $30 I'm used to paying at any llanteria. My bf did not want to drive around, so we agreed. 

It took about 35-40 mins and we were told it would only be 30. That was understandable because they do tend to get busy. 

We left the lot and ran our usual errands. A few hours later, we parked in a lot and heard a hissing sound come out of one of the tires. It was already losing air! We had to stop at QT three times that day to refill it up. We immediately took it back the next day and they offered to patch it. We informed them that they needed to replace it. The day after that, we noticed the OTHER tire was losing air.. you've got to be kidding me! I got a flat, we had to change it out for a spare, and made yet ANOTHER trip to QT. 

My patch that I had mentioned in my previous review was not a good one. The guys at Discount informed me that the person who made the patches did not know what they were doing.  If you need a patch, skip paying $6 for a bad patch and go to Discount, where it's free and done right!
Avoid coming here if you can! They will NOT give you your money back. 

--------------------------------------------------

After realizing there was indeed a nail in my tire, we stopped in to get a patch. It is a little out of the way, but for $6 a patch you are in and out in about five minutes without any hassle. Will be back for any tire needs I'll have in the future!"

Shopping,5.0,OR,"I came to see Russell to buy my engagement ring based on yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. The first time I went in, he would not talk prices or ring style. He simply spent 30 minutes educating me on how to evaluate/buy diamonds then told me to go shop at other stores. Of course, I came back to him. 
The next visit involved me explaining to him what my gf desired. He took his time talking to me and was not in a rush at all. After one more visit we finally had the exact type of ring design that I wanted. He also had the perfect type of diamond I wanted in stock. 

He custom made the ring for me to my exact specifications. He even started over when the ring did not come out perfect. He would not even let me see the mistake ring, saying ""you would not notice the mistake, but I know It would eat at me if I sold you that ring""

This was a fantastic experience, Russell loves making rings and his passion is clearly visible when you speak to him. He asked questions about my gf and even wanted to see a picture of us. He is an artist and takes extreme pride in what he does. 

Just a bit on pricing: His diamond pricing was excellent, I bought a diamond from him that had a similar version selling for $1500 more at a chain retailer. He buys the diamonds himself and gives the customer wholesale pricing. His charge for the custom ring was pretty much what I was getting quoted at all other diamond stores. All in all, he met my exact price range and gave me exactly what I want.

Hesitantly I decided to wait for the medium. Two weeks later I called the shop and got different answers. One person told me it was delayed, one told me it would be there Friday. Friday came and went, on Tuesday when I finally was able to talk to someone I was told my bike was no longer available in medium but the small was still there and I could come get it. So after leaving work early to come get the small I was told it was sold. While I was offered a loaner bike that to me is not really making up the situation. My car was sold as I was expecting my bike so now I am without transportation until at least another four weeks. I have purchased accessories for that bike, some that can't be returned and am stuck without a bike.

She agreed she could see in the notes that I had tried to cancel it, but went on to say nothing had been done. She then told me I would have to wait until the carrier delivered the cushions, then I would have to return them, and then I would get a refund within 5-7 days of when they were received back at the warehouse. That was clearly not acceptable, so I asked to speak with a manager.

Heather, a ""resolution expediter"", finally responded to my complaints by saying she had initiated re-routing instructions and had processed the refund.

With mask requirements, contactless registration and check-in, socially distant class seating, my friend and I felt safe and very comfortable with our first time candle making experience. Here's the Yelp tea on the class

Scene 
Located in a mixed use space this location serves as a retail space, workshop and the company's  headquarters.

Just in case you need a quick refresher there's is a bar with wine, bubbles, beer and juices conveniently located in the space. Be sure to check out the photo op with handy ring light. 

Service
Can't say enough about the service. I booked online and check-in onsite was quick and easy. We were greeted warmly and immediately given a quick tour of the space along with details on what to expect. 

Experience 
After grabbing the best seats in the house, we settled in and prepared to become candle making rockstars...well at least that's how I imagined it. Each place setting was equipped with sanitized tools and disposable instructions. After the instructor's brief overview, each table of four was then allowed to select a fragrance and candle vessel. Printable pick your fragrance cards helped with selecting the perfect scent. This hands on class was easy to follow and fun. The hour time slot makes this experience the perfect thing to do if you don't have a lot of time to spare. Don't forget extra cash, all class attendees receive a 20% discount on retail merchandise.

The fact that they have a full staff on hand to call and answer questions or help with orders is great. That leads me though to why I only give 3 stars and not 5 and why I am writing a review in the first place. I have called in many times for gear questions and for orders. Many times I have had a great experience with the customer service reps helping with orders or giving great info/advice on gear. However I have also called and asked gear related questions and felt like I was annoying them with my questions or that they couldn't get off the phone quick enough. I understand people have bad days and if it's busy they need to get on to the next call asap but being hung up on is never acceptable regardless. This has happened more than a few times and since they say their names when they answer the phone I know it's the same 2 or 3 people. I am usually never one to complain about stupid things and if it happened once I would not be here right now typing this but when I'm not even finish talking and the person on the other end hangs up and seems annoyed I get annoyed myself.
I own a business and a huge part of my business is customer service and I would never tolerate an employee hanging up on any customer without closing the conversion especially not someone being polite and asking questions about a product I offer. 
Besides these instances though I would say RevZilla as a whole is a great company and will continue to do business with them."

I had a great sales year and decided to gift myself with the love bracelet...girl power!  Being in sales, I am very critical of other sales reps and although Zhou Ni is a man, he did a fantastic job.  

I tried on a couple of the bracelets and he told me which one was my size.  It is very important to get the correct sizing on the love bracelet as there are 3 sizes.  Some people think they are a certain size but in fact they are another.  I was glad to have his expert opinion on what I should choose.  After I purchased the bracelet, he carefully explained how to take care of it and most importantly how to properly put it on and take it off.  This bracelet involves a screwdriver and 2 screws and needs to be screwed on a certain way (it's basically a chastity belt for your wrist)..you have to be very careful the way you screw it on and make sure everything is lined up.  Once that baby is on, it's on!  After he explained all of that, I told him I didn't feel like wearing it out of the store and to just throw the bracelet in a bag.  He insisted on wrapping it because it would be ""an experience"" opening it.  Sure enough, when I got home, it was beautifully wrapped and they used wax seals to secure it.  I'm glad he made me get it wrapped!  Well done Zhou

Things to know about Cartier:
1.  All buffing and cleanings are free for life
2. 30 day exchanges if you don't like something..no returns
3.  You have 90 days to get a free inscription which I think is cool 
4.  Love bracelet can be worn 27/7 in showers/working out etc"

Just lovely things like cranberry seed oil, rose hip oil, aloe vera juice, coconut oil, and vegetable based emulsifiers. I am not sure if I should spread it on my face or on my toast for breakfast. 

There was no pressure for me to buy on the spot, but he gave me some of the hand and body mousse (lavender scented) to moisturize a bit before heading to my event. My skin felt clean and silky right away. That coupled with a lovely light wafting scent of lavender made me totally party ready. 

I am now a regular devoted customer. The Alph Hydroxy Skin Therapy cream (made with botanicals) is my #1 remedy. It smooths my skin and makes my 70 year-old face look fresh and dewy - ok not 17 fresh and dewey, but definitely not 70 dry and wrinkly. The bath bomb is, well, THE BOMB! Fragrant, relaxing, and moisturizing, it makes for a perfect soak after a long hard day at work. The Hand and Body Mousse is light and non-greasy and keeps me feel scented and moisturized all day. And last but not least, the Hand & Foot Revival is magic in a jar. Bye bye alligator skin. Hello soft and smooth. 

I highly recommend this business for the high quality product that they make and the outstanding customer service they provide. This is a true Midtown gem."
Shopping,4.0,CG,"Another shoebox-shaped indie record store. I'd say this is a decent place to go if you're looking for new music. The selection is vast, and the prices are very reasonable. You can get good deals on used CDs. This one is still in good hands. The only downside I could see is the fact that it is a little pricier than other record stores, but I think the quality is good. I'd rather buy a used record from a local record store than a big box. I've been to many galleries, but this one is my favorite. They have a great selection of art, and some great pieces. They do have some really nice artists, but the selection is limited. They have a large selection of prints and posters, and some of the best looking pieces of art I have seen. They also have a lot of hard to find prints, so if you're looking for something specific, this is a great place to go. The staff is very friendly, and they'll tell you everything you need to know about your project. They will ask if you're interested in anything in your art, and will help you find a particular type of artwork you like. They also have great products for your art. The museum is organized, and the museum has a lot of interesting pieces. It's very well organized. The galleries are well laid out, and the building is clean and well-lit. You can get to see a lot of different kinds of artwork at different times of the day."
Shopping,2.0,OR,"""HOME OF THE ONE DOLLAR INSTALL"" thats all their work is worth, and that may be pushing it!!!!!!!!!!!!! I tried to leave NO stars, but it wouldn't let me!!!!!!!!!My boyfriend surprised me, by having a new stereo installed in my car. When i bought the car it had an aftermarket stereo in it already, so I'm assuming that audio express just went off the old cables for previous stereo. Havn't had too many problems with the stereo, hence the words too many, but when i took my vehicle to get it smogged it was REJECTED!!! I was told by three different places, that the stereo was installed wrong and was eating the computer chip and they couldn't smog my vehicle. Went into audio express and they insisted all vws are hooked up the same and that in order to get my vehicle smogged i would have to have the oem stereo reinstalled... wtf??? Really, you couldn't have mentioned this to us before installing an aftermarket stereo????? they took a look at my vehicle after i INSISTED!!! I was told that everything was fine. Got in my car and my brakes and abs lights are flashing at me....... they take it back into the store to fix the problem....... I was told that they fixed ""IT"", they didn't know what they did... I watched them wiggle stuff and shift stuff around under the hood..... I have my car back....lights are off on the dash, but now my brake lights dont work....... . i guess well see how things go this time???
Just thought i would do an update..... i cant believe these guys are even in business. I think it is the worst customer service one could receive...... I feel completely ripped off and taken advantage of. I will be taking my vehicle somewhere with PROFESSIONAL people. I would rather spend my money on having another shop fix their shoddy installation, then go back there and let anyone working there touch my car!!!!!!!!!"

I've also had to check out the clothes on sale, but I'm not sure if they're all brand new or new.  Overall, if you need something quick, they're probably going to get it.

Shopping,4.5,OR,"There was always an intimidating factor about the window display here...It seemed like one of those boutiques where you get excited, you walk in, and within peeking at 3 or 4 pricetags you feel your throat  close up and start feeling bad about yourself...then you look up at the store associate who peers down at you disapprovingly, eyes up your outfit, assessing whether or not you can afford to even walk through the door. 
How wrong I was. What happens when hipsters who graduate with jewelry making degrees, local bag designers with a bevvy of wares, and sellers of all craft-things-wonderful need to consign their goods? They come to Tselaine, where local owner Elaine accepts contracts from local people who make extraordinary things. 
        What I was most impressed with here was not the amazing jewelry, nor the scarves, bags, accessories, or other drool-worthy girl-fodder, but the incredible collection of tin toys. Yes, tiny, antique-looking tin windup toys, all for around $3. Some of them are Japanese robot type of toys, while other ones are more vintage Americana-themed, but they are all worthy of a windup and a go-round. 
       What I was most excited about here was the fact that I could have potentially bought every item in the store; nothing was out of my price range per se, meaning some of the bags would be a once a season splurge, but all in all, doable. 
         And the demeanor of every employee I have ever encountered here? So pleasant that most of the time I end up in a conversation about art or stuff or something else, just to make small talk with the lone shopkeeper in a little corner store that seems scary but suits me just fine. ...Kinda makes it hard to remember the idea of gift GIVING, though...there I go again, always thinking of mySELF..."
Shopping,4.0,OR,"Main reason why I like them in comparison to all the other paper stores I've been to: VARIETY.

1) I love their fun quirky gifts they have spread throughout the store. For example: one item picked up: fake gift box that looks like ""automatic pet petter""-- a device that pets your cat for you. hilarious-- you buy that box and then put the real gift inside. But they have other fun/interesting things you can peruse through and they change their stock often enough that you can find something new and fun!

2) Cards are interesting! They have all sorts of cards that look handmade, as well cards that are funny and not your run-of-the-mill Hallmark brand. They're a little bit on the expensive side ($5/card), and don't have as wide of a selection as Papyrus, but they're aimed more for the 20-30 year old crowd/those that are young at heart. 

3) They cover a wide range of supplies! So obviously, they won't have all the supplies you'd find at an art supply store but they have a lot of items that you'd need to make invitations or cards. And I love that you can buy envelopes and flat cards in bulk! So many sizes and colors! Other paper stores (even the art store) did not have things grouped in bulk and had less selection (since they're not specialized in stationary). They have ton of pre-made stamps that are fun as well as lots of fun pens/markers. They even have really cool gift wrapping (and the special glue you may need to use). And I love that they have classes you can take every month-- like learn how to make your own stationary, make mother's day cards, make your own wedding invitations... great. Plus, the girls in the back are really helpful and definitely are creative in figuring out how to reproduce what you want.

I know that when it's crowded it's a pain to navigate. But can we really hold their popularity against them? :)"

Shopping,4.0,OR,"Cheekwood is the former estate of the Maxwell House coffee tsars turned into an art museum and botanical gardens.

First the gardens. They're located throughout the sprawling estate with various plants and trees arranged along different pathways. One of the nice features is that they have a number of signs identifying the plants so that the less-green of us can know what we're looking at (e.g. ""Poison Ivy""). There's also a small pond as well as a fairly ornate Japanese Garden with a small amphitheater. 

There are some wide meadows mixed in and this probably wouldn't be a bad place to have a picnic. Along with that, there are a number of  benches to relax along the paths. I'd think it would be easy to stop along a stroll, set up shop at one of the benches and break out some fruit and sandwiches.

There's also a wooded path with sculptures along the trail. These weren't quite as exciting and the path does have some rockier and slightly steep areas. One of my companions was struggling to march along through this area.

There's also a tiny art museum in what looks to be a converted garage/stables. They had a few more contemporary impressionist pieces displayed inside, about 15 pieces total. I recommend this stop on a hot day because it's air conditioned.

Then there's the main manor. It's a more ornate estate home with rotating art collections (currently they have Faberge pieces in the upstairs) as well as some trinkets from the Cheekwood fortune. I was a little bemused reading the lengthy dynastic history of the family; it's like reading through a mix of wedding announcements (and then Helga  Wood married Jacob Stein, a successful shipping Magnate from Charleston.....and their daughter Cecilia married Henry Waxford who was a successful importer from New York City......who's son Trenton married.......) and the complicated lineage tree of old English Kings.

All in all, it's a nice place for a lazy weekend afternoon to stroll around the grounds; consider a picnic."

Shopping,4.5,OR,"I have been to SLAM a fair number of times. Last month's visit afforded me the opportunity to check out the new modern additions, including gallery space and a below-grade parking structure. The addition itself represents a work of art- seeing as how it is made almost entirely out of concrete- and infuses the space with natural and diffused light, showcasing the artworks to their best advantage.

My Mom and I visited midweek to take in the French Impressionist exhibit and the Rothko paintings on display. Doubtless, we could have made a day of it but we decided that dining and shopping were also priorities, and we wanted to concentrate on these particular exhibits as they would not be sticking around for a long time. The Impressionist exhibit was comprehensive, and featured artworks (photos and paintings, along with curated items in display cases) from museums across the country and around the world. I appreciated that the exhibit was organized into galleries according to the theme of each artwork (e.g. agrarian, industrial, mountains, forest, etc.). We opted out of the audio tour and enjoyed reading the accompanying descriptions and taking in the variety of works on display. When we left the museum, and went to the parking validation machine which showed how much time we spent inside, we were both surprised to find that almost two hours  had passed. I found it to be a rewarding experience, and the exhibits themselves were refreshingly uncrowded, coming as we did during the workweek. 

The garage is a good value for members of the museum, as discounted parking is on offer. The validation and navigation process is slightly tricky. I was relieved when I could see a glimpse of daylight, signaling that the end of our time in this underground maze was at hand. Perhaps this is a kink that has yet to be worked out with the addition of clear signage. It did provide a talking point and an excellent cap to a day out getting cultured."

Selected WFUP at the Home & Garden Show and were very happy with Matty who came out, gave us an estimate and was very informative and helpful....went down hill after signing the contract 5 WEEKS AGO. We are having a simple project - adding about 75 sq. ft. of additional concrete, resurfacing with cool deck and replacing white cap tile. 7 weeks later all we have is the old cool deck removed, the new cap tile and COMPLETELY CHIPPED water line tile that occurred when they were removing our old cap tile. It's been a week and with numerous calls asking to talk to Brian with no answer, a manager coming out and looking at the chipped tile the best they can do is say they will have a solution by the end of the week. Whatever that means. Matty told us the project would take about 2 weeks, we are on week 7 with ruined water line tile and no concrete formed. Additionally, the acid wash guys left a bottle of acid sitting in our yard (we have 3 dogs and a baby), the tile guys showed up unannounced at 530PM to do the new tile and barely finished before dark and used their tile saw (baby goes to sleep at 630), and to get anything ""on schedule"" I have to make repeated calls to the office to get updates. My husband is in development and construction and while most know things can be delayed - 5 weeks + for this type of project with very little responsiveness is ridiculous. In my opinion the only option to make good on this is to replace our water line tile that they ruined and finish this project by the end of next week.

She looks up from her phone and WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, points to the other associate behind the desk, whose face is also buried in her phone.

This isn't my first time receiving crappy customer service at this Lowe's but the first time I'm posting. But, hey, their philosophy is probably, ""There's no Home Depot or another Lowe's near us; so it is OK to suck.""

Shopping,3.0,OR,"Let me start by saying that I fucking HATE going to Costco, from the miserable employees (probably because they are underpaid), to the lack of aisle markers to let you know what is down every aisle (you have to walk down every aisle to see what's there), to the inconsistency of brands and selection of merchandise (you get used to buying something specific such as a brand of toothpaste and then you go there after your five pack runs out and they don't sell it anymore) to the way you have to exit the store (they are supposed to check your receipt to what's in the cart, but they don't even look, they run a black marker down the slip, and this causes a line of 20 deep sometimes, what's the point).

But, the produce is fresh, the salmon is fresh, the cheeses are inexpensive compared to grocery stores, the frozen strawberries are about half the price, the bakery selection is pretty good, and lately I found that their hot foods, such as rotisserie chicken and glazed ribs are above average, and pretty tasty, and best of all, CHEAP.  A 4.99 chicken sells for like 6.99-7.99 at a grocery store.  A FULL slab of ribs (about 14 ribs) that sells for $25+ elsewhere, comes in at about $18.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The salsa is very good, and the accompanying dipping chips were very very reasonable.  The lump crab meat is way cheap also, and good to have in your fridge.  I figured the parm reggiano cheese and Locatelli, are about 30% cheaper than store bought.

So, if you can deal with the bad lighting, lack of smiles from employees, and a dumb enter and exit strategy, the deals are pretty good.

Now only if the Commonwealth of PA will get off it's ass and allow Costco to sell beer and liquor, like in other states.  The savings when I am in Florida and take a trip to the local Costco are amazing."

Shopping,1.0,OR,"Boy, have I been waiting to leave this place a review!! I would rate this place ZERO stars if I could. We purchased a GE topload washer & dryer from the Appliance Outlet Center on 3/22/20. James processed the transaction from start to finish. My husband and I were advised that there were no issues with the set and that the machines still had a 1 year manufacture's warranty. Within a week, the dryer had stopped heating and would not dry the clothes. The same week, the washer would make a loud noise and would not drain the clothes. When the machine finished 'washing' a load, the clothes remained soaking wet. James got a tech out within a few days and was able to 'fix' the washing machine but the washing machine keeps breaking over & over again. When the tech came out the first time, he agreed that the dryer couldn't be fixed so James replaced it with a 'temporary' one (that didn't match the set) so they can take the dryer back to the shop, repair it, and return the dryer back. My husband and I have been in contact with this scam artist for 4 months now and we keep getting a runaround and have NOT received any update on when our dryer will be fixed! Best believe, it is now 6/19/20 and the dryer STILL hasn't been fixed!!! We keep being told that a tech should be contacting us 'any day' with an update, for 4 months now! This is a dishonest business who lies, cheats and scams people out of their hard earned money. James has refused a refund and still hasn't fixed our issue!! AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!! SAVE YOURSELF ALOT OF HEADACHE AND DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS DECEITFUL BUSINESS!!! THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND LEAVE YOU HANGING! THIS BUSINESS' PRINCIPLES ARE VERY DISHONEST. EITHER REFUND YOUR CUSTOMERS MONEY OR RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM, IMMEDIATELY. I WILL BE REPORTING YOUR SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BBB NEXT, SHAME ON YOU!"
Shopping,4.5,OR,"I have been a customer of CoAuto for several years now and they have done a great job every time. Rochelle and Albert are always very helpful and fun to talk to, and make sure you know what services will be done and what is recommended. The co-owner Vinnie has gone above and beyond for me in the past to make sure my truck was properly repaired and that I was happy. He once even drove out to where my truck had died on the street to attempt a repair, and when the problem was too complex to solve on the road, he took care of towing back to the shop and even drove me back home. Incredible service. Their shop utilizes an online intake and repair service called ShopWare that keeps you informed of everything before, during, and after inspections and services with notes and pictures included. You can approve services right there on your phone with all costs laid out in plain view. Their company also mails out promotional rebates and offers incentives for recommending their services to others. I am not a mechanic but do perform many services myself on my own vehicles, and have even used their inspections as a valuable roadmap for what needs to be done next and when. For everything I cannot do or am not confident enough to do, I take my truck to CoAuto and recommend them every time. Fair pricing, fast turn-around and great people to talk to. I wish every shop were like this one. Over the years I had gone through at least five different mechanics in Reno/Sparks and had big problems with all of them. My same vehicle has been in and out of CoAuto several times for vastly different jobs and has come out every time without issue. I just wish they worked on pre-1996/OBDII vehicles still as I have two early 90's cars that could really use their expertise at some point. Such is the life of the project cars."

I enjoy the occasional cigar, but the typical cigar shops can sometimes be a bit intimidating and stuffy.  This is NOT the case at Gran Cru!  I was treated as though I was just one of the guys and felt right at home. The owners and staff are extremely friendly, fun, knowledgable and passionate about their business and helping customers.  

The humidor is beautiful, classy and well stocked with what my boyfriend calls the ""microbrews of cigars"".  These are very high quality cigars, some of which are quite difficult to find elsewhere.  They'll gladly help you find the perfect cigar for your taste.  I use to just get one of their coffee cigars that I just love (I know, total chick cigar), but I've started to be more adventurous. Im so happy that I finally ventured out b/c I've found some awesome cigars that I like much more. My boyfriend mixes it up all the time and is never disappointed. 

The inside has comfortable leather chairs and decor that creates the perfect smoking atmosphere. There is even a back room with ample seating. They have numerous events throughout the month, as well as usually play the big games on their huge projector in the back room and on the TVs in the main area. When you consider the always pleasant and fun regular Gran Cru patrons who just enjoy hanging out, this is a perfect place to watch the games, have a post dinner cigar or purchase some great brands to stock your own humidor.  

My boyfriend has found his second home. Honestly, he spends a good amount of time here and just LOVES everything about it.  He'll just swing by after work or really anytime just to hang out and smoke.  Yes, I love going too!! 

Check it out!!!"

Shopping,3.5,OR,"We went to Genesis to pick out an engagement ring. One of the first things the woman helping us did was show me two identical settings in yellow and rose gold and told me to pick which color I liked better. I could barely tell the difference, and I wasn't even sure I liked the style, but she wouldn't move on until I picked a metal I liked better. I really couldn't tell the difference. Then we were passed onto someone else. The new woman immediately pulled my boyfriend away to talk to him separately. She didn't even ask if I wanted to be in the conversation about money, which I did. She talked to him in some back room while I sat there with no one helping me, left out of a conversation I wanted to be in. When they came back 10 minutes later, she wrote down the info for the rings they had me ""decide"" between and basically sent us away.

That week Genesis called about setting up an appointment. Since we weren't able to see anything the first time, we agreed. When we came in they took us back to the same exact ring we looked at last time!! We said we wanted to look at more styles. She started trying to sell that ring harder, since I loved it so much (which was news to me??). We asked if we could see some diamonds. She asked us if we were going to buy that day. We said we didn't know, because we hadn't been able to look at what we came in for! She flat out said if we weren't going to buy that day, she didn't have time for us, even though we made an appointment!! We left before our half hour appointment was even scheduled to be over.

Both times we were there, everyone was very pushy and frantic. I understand that their job is to sell, but it was ridiculous and stressful. I didn't even get to look around! It was a terrible experience."

I went in and saw a heavybag that I liked.  I asked the person behind the counter if they would hold it for me and they said 'yes of course.  for 24 hours'.

Went back the next day and the hevybag was clearly gone.  They told me that it had been sold so I asked about when I had been in there the day before and put it on hold and they had no answer for me.

The person behind the counter did say if I had anything to bring in, they might be able to put it toward a different bag.

I really didnt like any of the other bags that they had but I wanted to start training again soon so I went home and grabbed the ubiquitous bag of golf clubs that are in every closet and came back.  This bag of clubs had a set of barely used Nike irons and some decent woods - easily worth a couple hundred.  The woods alone were probably worth a couple hundred - $100 at the very least.
    They took the irons and one of the woods and the credit the gave me for the clubs? $50.

That seemed low to me I asked if they could give me a discount on the heavy bag as they promised me to hold one that they sold from under me.  They said no.  I asked if they could call a manager or owner and ask them.  They called and they said no again.

I decided to just go through with it as, again, I wanted to start training again and needed a bag.

So they are going to make more money from the clubs I gave them than the heavy bag I bought from them cost and they refused to discount it after breaking their word.

Shopping,3.0,OR,"What a great place to make memories! My customer experience at David's in Cool Springs completely exceeded all expectations. 

I am one of those customers that probably would drive any sales associate insane. My mother passed away when I was a teenager and I was apprehensive when it came time for me to find a dress. I was also completely indecisive about the style of the dress and price range.

The sales associate/stylist that assisted me, Kim Yasso, guided me through the entire process. She was kind enough to help me twice WITHOUT an appointment, and eventually helped me select my ""forever dress."" She also helped make my father feel right at home during what was possibly the most estrogen-filled experience of his life. I will not forget her kindness. 

I was blown away again when it came time for me to pick up the dress. Susan Moore, the alterations manager at the store, offered me some of her very precious free time to talk me through the alterations process. This was an extremely generous gesture that I will not forget. I did schedule my official appointment for a date closer to my wedding, but she helped calm some of my nerves about my figure in the dress.

Finally, I was most impressed with the team when it came time for me to order jewelry for all 9 of my bridesmaids. The necklaces were marked as clearance, but unfortunately, there were only 5 left in the store. The store manager, Tami Zoeller, was kind enough to call around to all of the nearby David's locations and find the 4 remaining necklaces that I needed. The jewelry was rush delivered to my house by the next day. I couldn't believe it! 

My apologies for the long post. Because I live in a city where there are a bazillion brides competing for the attention of a select few vendors, I was especially blown away at the amount of personal care that was given to me during every visit. 

Thank you Tami, Kim, Susan, and team!"

I purchase $8 worth of magnets and it cost me $5 to ship. When I received them, the two thicker magnets were perfectly fine, but the two thin magnets were cracked. I emailed their customer service and provided them with a picture, asking if they could replace the two thin ones with less expensive, thicker magnets that could stand up to the shipping. The response was the same form email everyone else has received, saying that they are brittle by nature, so they aren't responsible once they're shipped.

I replied that I paid for four magnets and they shouldn't be content with only half of them showing up in one piece, hoping they would come to their senses and pay the $5 maximum it would have cost to rectify the situation. I was ignored. Finally a couple days later I sent an email threatening to dispute charges and negatively review them if they didn't replace the magnets or refund the cost of the broken magnets plus shipping. Their response was: ""A credit card refund has been processed for the magnets you broke."", blaming me for the issue and ignoring my request that they refund the shipping, which was the bulk of the cost as the broken magnets retailed for under $2 combined.

One more back and forth and all I got was a snotty attitude from their ""customer service"" guy, further blaming me for the issues, because even though they admitted that the magnets were very brittle, I was told that it was impossible for only two of them to brake in transit (even though the ones that didn't break were far thicker and less brittle). I have since disputed the shipping charges and cost of the magnets (have yet to see the refund go through) and will never, ever use this terrible company again."

Ironically, the girl who checked us in (I think her name was Jennifer) said oh we are running a little late.  1.5 hours is not a little.  5 mins is a little, but I kept my cool.

At the end of November I booked a couples massage and a cave experience for December 27th at 10am. We live in San Diego and I wanted to plan a birthday getaway. I also booked a hotel in Santa Barbara that was a top rated hotel (not cheap). I asked the lady who took the reservation at the salt caves if they'd notify us if they'd be shutting down again due to Covid and she assured me she'd let us know ASAP. Well, a few weeks later I called again and they assured they were still open. 
A few days ago I checked the website and Google and there was no indication that the salt cave was closed. 
Even this morning, December 26th, I received a confirmation text at 8:15!!! I confirmed immediately. My husband and I started driving up to Santa Barbara and when we were about an hour away, around 11am on the 26th, I received a call that they'd need to cancel our appointment for tomorrow. Less than 24 hours!!! And not to mention the lady calling me had no empathy or sympathy and she couldn't or wouldn't tell me when they knew they'd need to cancel!!! So now, because I couldn't give the hotel 24 hour notice, I'm out $450.
If I would have received this news at least a day earlier, I could have changed all our plans and would have been ok with it. I understand with Covid but this timing was unacceptable and the way I'm which it was done was unprofessional.


Edit: In response to Mike's message below, I work with people daily at my job and if anything changes to affect customers, I contact them immediately. There's no excuse to knowing that on December 6th, there's no email or phone call made informing us that services won't be available? That's the only item I'm touching on.

I made arrangements to return on Thursday, 2 January at 1000hrs, opening time. 

I left the computer at 1000hrs and waited to hear from him. I knew they closed at 1800hrs on Thursday and the time was 1615 hrs and I hadn't heard from him. I called and was shocked that he wasn't aware that my computer was in his store and he hadn't worked on it. 

I had to leave the country on 3 January at 1300hrs and had no time to leave my computer for him to work on. When I explained that he created a very difficult problem for me he replied, ""what do you want me to do, I'm between a rock and a hard place on this."" I explained that he created the problem he should find a solution for me. I told him he said it would be done by the end of the day. He then lied to me telling me, ""I never said that"". I assured him he did say that and he did not rebut my claim.I knew he had a refurbished computer similar to mine for $500.00 and asked him how much would he knock off the asking price. He went and asked the owner and came back with, ""I'll take $20.00 off and I can't go lower because I won't be making any money of it."". I told him that was unacceptable and hung up. 

Bottom line: do not do business with this company. Jim is a liar and the owner doesn't care at all about problems that he or his employees create. If you need repairs of any type I ask that you go elsewhere and not patronize this establishment."

My son takes good care of his phone and I'm confident he has not had it in water.

After looking online and talking to a friend who is a Mechanical Engineering professor, it's pretty clear that this ""liquid indicator"" is a loophole that allows Apple to not honor the warranty.  Apparently it's highly sensitive and even high humidity or sweat can change the color of the strip. 

3) I talked to the manager who explained the liquid indicator light a bit more thoroughly but she had no real interest in being responsive.  When she tried to sell me extended warranty for an additional big charge and I said ""You did not honor your warranty, I'm sure as hell not buying an extended warranty"" in a casual way she terminated the conversation and wanted to get me out of the store ASAP.  Guess they don't want other customers hearing about this apparently continuing rip off.

All in all an excessive wait, they ripped me off, and it was unpleasant on every level. If you deal with Apple I'd strongly recommend another outlet.

Part of the irony here is that the people at the AT&T store in Wayne were polite and
pleasant but had no way to help while the service at the Apple store was poor
and they had control but no interest in being helpful."

Shopping,1.5,OR,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!! Don't try to save money by going here I promise you will regret it! I do! Very very very stressful experience will never recommend Gary to my worst enemy! I swear all the good reviews on this shop has to be people that know him. I can't see how anyone could actually be happy with him. This past weekend was my wedding and everything was magical except for the tuxes they were a nightmare! Don't believe a word this man says! Non of the tuxes fit 2 of the guys pants couldn't button. He blamed it on my father in law being a big guy and my thing is ok then maybe if you can't accommodate that then you should SAY THAT! and then I get ooo you can come pick up new tux ok when well not anytime soon because I'm not there. Ummm not my problem it's the day before my wedding you are an hour away from me. My father in laws pants were too small, my brother in laws pants were too small, my cousins shirt wouldn't button, one of the groomsman jacket didn't button and the ones that weren't too small were huge! And then this is the kicker the sole of my dads shoe fell off in the middle of the reception. My poor father had to do the father daughter dance with no shoes. Plus it was raining out so his foot got soaked! Gary wants me to send him pictures to help promote his store! YEAH RIGHT! I will never support this store the only photos I'll send is ones of all the stains that were on all the tuxes and my poor dad having to walk around with no shoes on. Ooo yeah the tuxes were filthy I don't think they are EVER washed and I almost forgot my husbands cousin had 2 different shoe sizes! Very disgusting store please spend the extra money and go elsewhere! Horrible customer service should have been offered something back but no everything was our fault apparently!"

Shopping,4.5,OR,"For the pipe smokers out there;

I am neither a cigar, nor frequent cigarette smoker. What I am is ""that F(@*&!% hipster!"" bobbing and weaving through traffic and pedestrians in center city on a bicycle with a corn cob hanging out of his mouth. It is rare to find a shop, even a ""smoke"" shop with pipe tobacco of quality surpassing drugstore brands like Captain Black. Places with quality tins like Dunhill or Davidoff are a rarity, I can only think of a single other place in Philadelphia that has them. Places with exotic tins like flake, or actual St. James Perique blending tobacco are almost unheard of, I know of two other places in the area (and by that I mean NY and NJ) that stocks things like that.

This place, was a first though. I love a good English blend, and the more Latakia the better. I looked around for a little bit and saw the usual suspects in tin tobaccos like Elizabethan when a man asked me if I could be helped. I told him exactly what I was looking for, a Latakia heavy  English blend. Not only did the guy not look at me like I was speaking Afrikaans to him he was more than passingly familiar with pipe tobacco. He took me over to their loose blends, which I typical avoid out of habit, since in my experience they're often stale and crappy bulk buys off the internet in a fancy jar. He pointed out a mixture and told me they blend it there.

Wut? I said, with a preposterous look on my face.

What a blend. What a price. It was fragrant, spicy, and fresh. Virginias, Orientals and a heavy hit of Syrian. Exactly what an English blend should be. Exactly what I was looking for, and most importantly he knew it. Finding people TRULY familiar with tobacco in this day and age, especially pipe tobacco, is incredible. To find ones that are so familiar they blend on premises AND get it right is insanity.

Six stars if I could. Can not praise them enough."

I had a couple of questions about my engagement ring, and they were able to help me answer them.  I am a big fan of the store and the staff is very knowledgeable.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not close to my house and I had to go in with my parents and the manager.

I was not able to purchase my ring at all, but was able to get it for me at the store.  I have been going to this store for years and I was very happy with the service!

Shopping,3.0,OR,"The staff of this H&M are some of the WORST retail employees I have ever encountered. 

Friday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling ""you're welcome"" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. 

Saturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it ""should be"". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is ""not their job"". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, ""not my job"" attitudes take you far!

Also, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust."
Shopping,3.5,OR,"I want to put it out there, up front: as far as I can tell, the medical care at Whitson is highly competent. My ""mehh"" review is a result of the decline in warm and personalized customer service I've noticed there, over the past few visits. It has nothing to do with the quality of medical care I've received. I feel confident that was on-point. The thing is. I feel like just a number at Whitson. Firstly, I'm NOT the biggest fan of the new self check-in kiosk. HOW impersonal! Sure, I was able to manage the touch screen program just fine, but I did witness two ""older folks"" spend long minutes in frustration trying to figure it out -- and no one from the office staff seemed to take any particular notice. Also, as a constructive criticism, if the kiosk is going to be an (unfortunate) permanent fixture, I would suggest putting it on or near a more substantial table. I was frustrated trying to balance my (admittedly, over-large) purse while riffling through my belongings to find the correct cards for self-scanning. Bleh. I felt no less chagrinned after waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time to be seen. No one noticed. No one apologized or gave explanation. One breath of fresh air in the (otherwise lukewarm) experience was the technician who did all the heavy lifting in terms of performing the prescription portion of my eye exam. She was funny and friendly and made me feel welcome with conversation beyond the perfunctory. Then, I was moved on to another room to wait another 15 minutes for the doctor who spent. MAYBE 10 minutes with me before whizzing off. If the days of congenial customer service are gone and there's no attempt to cultivate a trusting, personal ""relationship"" by my neighborhood doctor's office, why would I be enticed to spend the extra dinero at their exorbitant in-office optical shop? I got better-than-adequate care at Costco (where I would expect to be treated as only a number, by sheer volume) and I paid only about 1/3 of Whitson's price. Just."

Shopping,3.0,OR,"Although this location had low ratings, I booked my appointment here anyway because it was the most convenient location. I also scheduled my appointment on a Saturday during a holiday weekend, knowing that it was going to be very busy, which it was. We arrived and didn't have to wait long for our consultant, Arizia, to help us begin. I had printed out a few styles I wanted to try and she was great and pulling them for me. There was one dress I found online that I thought was going to be THE dress, but when I tried it on in the store it looked awful on me. I was devastated, but continued to try on other dresses. Arizia was juggling me and one other bride as it was very busy, but she was so attentive I didn't feel as though I was sharing her at all. She was also very knowledgeable and found me the perfect undergarments in the right size, even though I never told her what size I was. I tried on one dress that I found on the rack that I thought was going to be the one, but I was hesitant. Arizia asked me if I was too tired to try on one more dress, her favorite dress in the store. When she brought it into the fitting room I thought I was going to hate it, but as soon as I stepped in front of the mirror and added the veil, my party and I started crying. It is the most perfect dress, combining all of the elements I wanted into a dress I would not have picked for myself, and fit perfectly within my budget. When I said yes to the dress, Arizia hugged me and congratulated me and let me ring the victory bell. Immediately other brides in the store came over to our area and started congratulating me on finding my dress and telling me how beautiful I looked. It was an amazing and empowering experience. If you are a bride looking for a wonderful experience, ask for Arizia!"
