Food,4.0,CG,"Great place and friendly family atmosphere. The coffee is good too. Also, the people are awesome. I absolutely love the coffee here, and the staff is always friendly."
Food,4.5,CG,"This is definitely one of the better breweries in the area.

The beers are decent, but a little too hoppy for my taste. The atmosphere is a bit of a"
Food,1.5,CG,The store did not have what I wanted. It seemed like it was going to be a one time thing. I had to get a manager to get the manager to help me get
Food,4.0,CG,"Amazing view. Tiny place though. Staff is nice. Great ambiance. 

The wine is good. If you want to try a few things, the staff is nice"
Food,4.5,CG,Use to live here. Bought some of the fruit and veggies here. Also tried the yellow fruit one. It's not the best but it's good. The flavor of the fruit
Food,4.5,CG,"Meh.. my latte was ok, not the best, but I will say that the barista was very nice and had the best energy, both in the coffee and espresso"
Food,4.5,OR,"The service here is great as well as the ice cream!!!! OMG delicious! Was craving something sweet like ice cream and brownie, looked on yelp and decided to check it out! I left on cloud 9!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Had a great visit to the tasting room today. I always enjoy Brad's sense of humor and knowledge of the wines, so I was happy to see him behind the counter. And the wines never disappoint!"
Food,3.0,OR,This is a nice little market. I stopped in to get my favorite Harpoon UFO White beer from Boston. It is the only place in Old City that carries it. The staff was friendly and helpful.
Food,4.0,OR,"Do not go here if Joseph is working, or at all for that matter. I go to total wine all the time at home and the staff was just disrespectful, leering, and rude for no reason"
Food,5.0,OR,"Hands down best ice cream I have ever had! But even if it wasn't, I would still love this place! It was extremely family friendly and setup to play boards games while enjoying your ice cream."
Food,3.5,OR,"The store was well organized and had a pretty good wine selection. 
There was, however, a sign on the door that said cash only, or credit card machine isn't working. Hopefully that's only a temporary thing."
Food,4.0,OR,"You need to update your hours on yelp. I came all the way out (to no avail!) because yelp indicated you are open until 3:00 pm on Sundays, but you close at 2:00 pm. Very frustrating..."
Food,4.0,OR,Attended the Big Harvest here and really love this place.  All the different rooms and interesting stuff!  Can't wait to come back and find out what their regular food and drink menus are about.
Food,2.5,OR,"I hate grocery shopping!!! But I am really glad we have a Sams club in Hendersonville.
It is very convenient for me. I have always been able to get in and out of this place really easy."
Food,3.0,OR,"This is, to me, a typical COSCO.  Friendly folks etc.
My biggest gripe is with the chain in general.
Automation at the snack bar cuts down on the people watching opportunities and eliminates jobs in today's economy."
Food,2.0,OR,"Awesome dunkin, best in the area.  Drive through is very fast, they prep food ahead of time.  Only concern is the location 9th the ordering board blocks your view for crossing through the lot."
Food,2.0,OR,"It is hard to screw up Sbux, as I call it. It's close by, and the drive thru is open late which I am happy about. SO far so good. Let's hope it stays that way!"
Food,4.5,OR,The staff was extremely rude and pretentious about their beer. I understand being proud of your work but this is different.  Most of all most of the taps were not cleaned recently. Would not recommend.
Food,4.5,OR,"Just a note: Their amazing house-baked goods aren't available during COVID-19 restricted service. Their purchased pastries (croissants, etc) don't have vegan options. Looking forward to the return of their house-baked goods (and overall normalcy) someday soon!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Such great food and service. I work close to this bakery and not only do they have delicious sweets, but they have stellar coffee and sandwiches! You should definitely visit...you will not be disappointed at all!"
Food,2.5,CG,"The Starbucks location is more convenient than the one on Virginia. The drive through is pretty quick. The workers are nice, but they're not very friendly."
Food,2.5,CG,"Horribly understaffed.  Waited 20 minutes for the coffee and tea.  Also, the guy behind the counter wasn't wearing a mask.  I also ordered the T"

I think the place is"
Food,4.5,CG,Great find. The staff was friendly and the drinks were good. My husband got a caramel macchiato and it was delicious. The only down side is the parking.
Food,4.0,CG,Super rude customer service. The cashier was rude and just wasn't friendly at all. I just wanted a coffee but the coffee I got was sub par.I love this place.
Food,3.5,CG,"This is some tasty ice cream. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The owner, ""Jennifer"" is extremely rude."
Food,2.5,CG,This is the slooooowest Starbucks I have ever been to. I will never ever go back to this location. If you want to get your coffee and then have a drink in
Food,3.5,CG,Liquor industry is the last word to describe the store. It is a lovely little store with a variety of items. The staff is helpful and friendly.
Food,4.0,CG,Casey's is the best snowball stand in the area.  I will say that the best part about this place is the unique flavors.  There are so many different flavors to choose
Food,4.0,CG,We showed up at 10:45 and it was just as crowded as it was before. I was pretty disappointed. There was a lot of room for customers and the waitstaff was great

Food,4.0,CG,"First time at this place, and it was the best. I got a half dozen mini donuts. They are huge and delicious. The icing is also the best part."
Food,4.5,CG,"The ice cream was very good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the customer service. I had the opportunity to get a ""ice cream"" and the woman who helped me"
Food,4.5,CG,"Good ice cream, homemade ice cream, and the prices are a little high for the size..................."
Food,4.5,CG,"A great mom and papa ice cream, with lots of flavor. 

The fruit flavors are a little too sweet for my liking.  The coconut flavor is a bit strong"
Food,4.5,CG,Love the beers here.  We had the IPA and the IPA.  Both were excellent.  The atmosphere is industrial and open.  There is also a bar area inside.

Food,3.0,OR,None of the donuts i looked online were available. When I got home I ordered   and they gave me raspberry. The chocolate cake donut was hard and stale. I probably won't visit you guys anymore.
Food,4.5,OR,This place is so fresh and so good!!! Its way better than any other place in Philly because they use fresh ingredients! Theres a free parking lot so you can just drive there without worrying about parking.
Food,4.5,OR,We stopped here in the afternoon and enjoyed a flight and then a pint of our favorite. I would definitely recommend this to any fan of craft beer. It's a very short walk from the French market.

Food,4.5,OR,Delicious but expensive institution. So many unique flavors you will want to try them all. No trip to Santa Barbara is complete without a visit to Mcconell's. Plus the new state street location is cute and convenient!
Food,4.0,OR,"Whatever, this place is way awesome compared to the usual Italian bakery crap you find. So it gets 5 stars. No, it's not a boutique ""one store only"" bakery, but for a franchise it's really damn good."
Food,4.0,OR,"We loved both juices r ordered (spicy lemonade and some kind of turmeric ginger blend) and my salad. I wish I could have their food daily. My body would thank me.
People there were very nice as well."
Food,3.5,OR,"Store very clean, however, as with more businesses lately sadly only two cashiers always long lines. Waited at the deli for a really long time and it just seems understaffed. The prices are much higher than Publix."
Food,4.5,OR,"I love this place. I only wish they were closer to Philadelphia. But so worth the drive. 
The milk is fresh. I am down with the 4%
The chocolate milk is outstanding and you can't beat the aides."
Food,5.0,OR,Best Ice cream in South jersey in my opinion. the only downside is they arent open all the time and they only take cash. If you can make both of those work this is a must have
Food,4.0,OR,"Delicious! Finally got to try after I've seen all their ads on insta, and it was worth it! I got the berry cheesecake, so yummy! Def going back, and already told a few people about it too!"
Food,3.0,OR,"It would be great if the cashiers worked as fast as they talked....  if I have three items,  then maybe I am in a hurry and don't have time to listen to the clerks day??"
Food,3.5,OR,"coffee was not good. small latte, milk was over heated and scalded. couldn't even taste the coffee. ended up filing it in #13. they did have a great quiet open space for studying with ample seating though"

I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very"
Food,4.5,CG,"I got two cannolis, and one strawberry shortcake. Both were fantastic. The cake was moist and the icing was not too sweet. The icing was also light and moist."
Food,4.0,CG,Definitely has the feelings of a place you want to try out. The fruit and veggies are so fresh and delicious. The cakes and muffins are so delicious.
Food,3.0,CG,"Just a small town off of Pinellas, which is a lot of fun!

The owner is super friendly and the beers are good. The atmosphere is nice and it's nice"
Food,4.5,CG,Needed a fun gift for my wife and I.  I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude
Food,4.0,CG,"Not worth it.

Food,4.5,CG,"Okay so I love their ice cream, but the prices are a bit high for the size and the portions are small. The staff is always friendly and the shop is clean."
Food,4.0,CG,So good. Delivery service to go. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the customer service. I had an employee open the door at 6:30 and the store was closed.
Food,3.5,CG,"One was good... creamy and not overly sweet. 

I love that they have a couple different flavors so I had to try a few. The coconut flavor was a great mix and"
Food,2.0,CG,"I waited in line for a while and the cashier was rude. When I got to the front she said ""the lady is busy. The lady is busy."
Food,3.0,OR,"A great store. But why can't I also get beer and snacks here? Like, why cannot here and sev-elev just merge? Then it would be like, problem Solved, beech. Maybe our money hangry leaders should think about THAT!"
Food,3.0,OR,This Starbucks is horrible! 9/10 my order is always wrong ! And i go right before work so i rarely get it changed! I wish there was another Starbucks close by other than this one I'm always disappointed
Food,2.5,OR,This Walmart abuses fish I have been here 3 times this week and each time there are more dead fish each time and there are some fish stuck to the filters and things growing out of the filter
Food,3.5,OR,"Always over charging, every time we shop I check my receipt and errs are always found. We shop early on senior day and a lot of there products are not in the computer system yet."
Food,2.5,OR,Acme - you have redeemed yourself!  I desperately needed a roast chicken the day before Xmas (Christmas eve day) and they were not only open (and a bit crowded but not awful) but had fresh birds ready.
Food,2.0,OR,"Not only does this location lack product availability during the morning rush, but the employees are slow, rude, and do not get the orders correct. If you want a stress free morning, go to Richboro- so much nicer!"
Food,3.0,OR,"While there are good deals on some items, most items are more expensive than Target, walmart or grocery stores, especially when ya buy one item and they charge you for two (overscan) and do not catch their mistake"
Food,3.5,OR,I travel the state with work and often stop into liquor stores to check what they might have that's tough to find.  American Spirits has a great selection and knowledgeable staff.  Worth checking out for sure.

Food,4.0,OR,"We needed libations for the evening. Though we didn't find the Ciroc we were looking for, we did get some Grey Goose for $18.99 which is a decent price for a quality alcohol. Service was quick and efficient."
Food,3.5,OR,"The staff here is friendly, quick, & pleasant to be around. The closing staff people were accommodating in making my drink. They close later than most of the Starbucks near Santa Barbara. I would definitely come here again"
Food,4.0,OR,"I love this place. The lobster price here beats out anyone's prices around Philly, hands down. Also, their produce section is second to none. Their best feature is their Asian foods, where I can find my Filipino ingredients."
Food,4.5,OR,"Excelent new micro brewery right in our neighborhood. The beers are crisp, unique and "" to style"" all at the same time!! WTH!!?? They've got mussels on the food menu tonight. I'll review after I eat."
Food,4.5,OR,Great ice cream! However I did notice the yellow cake batter tasted different then when I had it a few months ago. Not sure if they switched producer or what. I miss the Sherman's original yellow cake batter
Food,4.5,OR,Came here after dinner - seatings were comfortable and it has good collection of board games and card games. A good variety of beer from local and other small breweries. Would be nice if it's near my home!
Food,4.0,CG,"Very pleasant place with outstanding customer service and an excellent selection of craft beers! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The beers were great, and the prices were very reasonable. The only downside is that"

Food,4.0,OR,"Had the popcorn from the store and it was AMAZING...
Ordered popcorn from website. It was the most dry, most stale popcorn I've ever had. Disgusting. A complete waste of my money. Definitely wasn't fresh or even close to it."
Food,4.5,OR,"The best almond croissant (bear claw) I've had! It's a must. All of the pasteries I've had are great. This place smells like butter, sugar, and coffee when you walk in- what could be better?! Great cold brew too."

Food,4.0,OR,"Our favorite breakfast/coffee/snack place.. from speciality coffee to morning cocktails. They are top notch in service, taste and ambience. And the plus is not heavy on pocket. Can not wait for them to open up after the covid situation."
Food,4.0,OR,They always do a good job and there is never much of a line if any.  A good alternative to CDM because the lines there are ridiculous.  Both indoor and outdoor seating but limited in capacity. Recommended.
Food,4.0,OR,"This is an interesting grocery store.   There are a lot of items for the vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free crowd, but don't let that stop you.   There's plenty for the rest of us and it's actually pretty reasonably priced."
Food,5.0,OR,"Fantastic experience. Great customer service, and the smoothie is pretty good too. Had the espresso yourself, a cute name. Subbed almond milk for coconut milk with no problem. Clean, quick and friendly service. What more could you ask for!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I am sooooo happy to have a nice little winery with several selections of great wine!!  Can't wait for their grand opening this Saturday July 28th at 1 pm.  Hopefully, some of my friends will be there!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Great spot! My latte was amazing, and on the weekends they have ""croissant doughnuts"" which I really enjoyed. Their plain coffee isn't my favorite, but, it gets the job done, and after your first coffee refills are only $1!"
Food,4.5,CG,"Went here over the weekend and it was a very pleasant experience.  There were a few tables and a couple of tables to sit, but they also have a couple more chairs and some comfy"
Food,4.0,CG,"This is definitely not the best place to go to in Nashville.  There is a large selection of beer and wine.  I am not a huge beer fan, so it is pretty much just a"
Food,4.5,CG,"Taro bubble!  

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the service is terrible. I had to ask for a small bubble tea with no bubbles."

Food,2.0,CG,This place has everything and more. The only thing I don't like is that the person who is working there is very nice. The guys that work there are always so nice and go above and beyond
Food,3.5,CG,"Close to work so I go to the Starbucks on Virginia. The drive through is pretty quick. There's a drive through, which is convenient if you're in a hurry."
Food,2.0,CG,"Pretty average store. Definitely small, but the quality and quality of the produce is just the same.Great coffee and pastries! I got a small iced coffee, a white chocolate macadamia"

Food,3.0,CG,"We hadn't been here in a while and thought we'd try it. Well, I was disappointed. We ordered the raspberry tart. The tart was tart, but not the perfect tart."
Food,4.5,CG,"One of my favorite breweries in the area. 

They have a great variety of beers. They are always very good. The guys that work there are always so nice and friendly.

Food,2.5,CG,Great service but my Carmel macaroon was very bland. My husband had a caramel macaroon and said it was good but not worth the extra money. This place is definitely not worth it
Food,5.0,OR,Black and white cookies all day.  I've had them at other bakeries and haven't been a fan.  This might be the best cookie in the city.  Whoever is at the front desk is always friendly and attentive.
Food,5.0,OR,This place is super cute ended the 45s for sale. The coffee was so good. I couldn't decide what to get and the staff was super helpful and patient. Ended up with the very best iced coffee I've ever had!
Food,4.5,OR,One of the closest local brewers so I possibly overlook because it is so convenient; but it always has good dark roasted beers (Stouts & Scottish Ales) and very creative flavors.  Too many good beers to only pick one!
Food,4.0,OR,"Alia's has the best bagels in town. If you are looking for bagels and delicious cream cheese, this is the place to go. Coffee is okay, not the best but bearable. A lot of space for family and friend get-togethers."

Food,4.5,OR,"Crema, I miss you.

It's hard going from the most perfect, delicious espresso, cortados, cubans to trying to find a coffee shop, or brewtique rather, that could deliver the same consistently amazing coffee, atmosphere and hospitality.

Time to go back to Nashville..."
Food,3.0,OR,Cakes are pretty to look at but the taste...meh. The only thing I recommend is the Lobster tails and regular cannoli's. The cookies always taste stale to me (not a huge Italian cookie fan either) and they are super expensive.

Food,4.0,OR,Fun place. Weird location in a run down plaza. Very inconspicuous store front but once you get through the door it opens to a large tap room full of games and abstract art. Great place I'm glad I came in.

Food,2.5,OR,AVOID THIS LOCATION!  This location is horrible.  They always mess up my order.  They must not clean very well because their lattes taste horrible.  I asked for a refund and the manager was rude.  Never again.

The only downfall is that they dont have pistachio ( my favorite flavor ) on 24/7/365"
Food,3.5,OR,"When you work as customer service you need to be friendly.  Hostesses were having personal conversion with each other not acknowledging us, waitress was bothered when we changed our drinks and it was before she brought it over.  How SAD."
Food,3.0,OR,"My go to place to buy fruits, vegetables and chicken. Can't beat the prices and great quality food. Their to go soups are also really good. I love their bulk items as well. I always buy plantain chips and chili corn."

Food,3.5,OR,"I've this store. Tge customer service is great. It is neat and clean. If something is forgotten in my pick up order, they make it better right away. It starts at the top and to me it's obvious the leadership is good."
Food,3.5,OR,"The macarons were very good. The chocolates were wonderful. They had a nice and interesting variety of both. It was more expensive than Oreos and Hershey's bars, but it was tasty, a good experience, and an acceptable price for an every-now-and-then treat."

Food,3.5,OR,"The best vegan/veggie pizza around. If you need to order a vegan cake I recommend the chocolate raspberry with chocolate ganache glaze. Honestly, one of the best cakes I've ever had! Whole Foods knows what they're doing when it comes to vegan!"

The drive through was pretty quick. There was a line out the door and the line out the door was very short.

The person who waited on me was very nice. The girl that served me was very nice. She made sure to make my drink"

Food,3.5,OR,"Tried to order a simple cocktail and the waitress was rude-told me ""this is a local bar, we don't have a drink menu, we have crown royale"". We walked out. If you like greasy shots and bottled beer this place is for you."
Food,3.5,OR,"This is an event, not an ice cream shop. They use liquid nitrogen to freeze your treat in front of you. So cool and tasty! Only reason it's not five stars would be to the efficiency of the line. Worth the wait, though."
Food,3.5,OR,The smoothies are delicious but I was disappointed with my acai bowl today. I expected it to be fozen or slushy like but it was actually just completely melted liquid. I put it in the freezer for about an hour before eating it.

Next time I'll try the donuts!"
Food,4.5,OR,"My favorite ice cream spot in all of Tucson. Their honey ice cream is AMAZING. It's also a cute little shop, with little touches that make it feel like a modern ice cream counter. Plus their workers are always super upbeat and delightful."
Food,2.5,OR,"One heck of a scam on everyone, they refuse to give back small change, I guess you know where that money goes, this place is too lazy to fix the lock on the female restroom. Just pay more money and get better help."
Food,4.0,OR,"An old ice cream shop in Philly. The ice cream was good, the portion was large but the price was WAY TO HIGH! I  believe there has to be other places to have some ice cream that would cost a lot less."
Food,4.5,OR,"Get the black and gold - french vanilla and chicory ice cream with hunks of oreos and chocolate chips!  They only have it during football season.  With inspiration like this, it is now wonder why the Saints are on a roll."
Food,4.0,OR,"Stay away from raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. They are nasty here. For 3.99$ for a small pack, it is really disappointing to get such terrible tasting berries. So upset...throwing money in the garbage.

Food,4.0,OR,"Great service! Great variety! Great parking!  

If you're visiting, this is prob the best place to stock up on bottles for the weekend!

In NOLA, pretty much any store doubles as a liquor store so no need to search any further than here!"
Food,3.0,OR,Basic Target. Nothing outstanding here. This place does get very crowded cause it's the most convenient Target to Center City. Customers are a lot better than the Wal Mart across the street. Sales people were generally friendly when I did ask for help.

Food,4.5,OR,"Came for a business trip late October. Bought the kale, spinach, and carrot juice twice (not easy to get veggies on a business trip to Philly). Tasted great. You won't find more reasonable prices in the City.

One Suggestion: More kale and spinach, less carrot."

Food,4.5,OR,"All the way from Los Angeles, CA to watch the Dodgers we had to try this brewery tour. Overall it was interesting, not too lengthy, FREE, and great tasting beer at the end. Although, the gift shop was great, it was well over priced."
Food,3.5,OR,The flavors were good but had to pay extra for boba? From a boba shop? I don't think that's worth my 5 dollars considering the cup size and having to pay extra... Hoping to see this place grow into more flavors and toppings soon.
Food,4.0,OR,super cute location with tons of sweets to fest on! The key lime macaroons were AMAZING! This is a great addition to the Datz brand and I cant wait to go back! I think they do need to move over the cakes and cupcakes!
Food,4.5,OR,"Great beer, great food, great owners! The North of Here, Cocco-Nut Brown, the Lemon Grass Tripel and Mo's Red are awesome. The food is good but we almost always get the Avondale Flatbread with a side of fries, goes perfect with our favorite beers."
Food,4.5,OR,The black raspberry chip tasted like something I could find at Walmart and the mango sorbet tasted like fake mango. Overall I had heard great things about this place and was disappointed. Positives were the staff was nice and nice area to sit outside.

Food,3.5,OR,"The meat selection is good. Although a bit pricey the quality is superb. All the other things that you can buy at the regular supermarket , buy where cheaper. I only go when I need a special choice of meat or a specialty product."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great ice cream and water ice!  Delicious!  It can be a little hectic when it gets busy in there-- not a very organized ordering process, but it's worth it.  They also charge an additional 2.75% fee to use a credit card."
Food,4.5,OR,A tradition for us whenever we are back in St. Louis. Nothing fancy.  Just what you need to cool off a little on a hot afternoon. Keep it simple and stick to the small size or you might feel a little ill afterward.
Food,4.5,OR,SSSOOO GOOD! And juicy! I got the watermelon lemonade and it was very refreshing and tasty. My only complaint was that the Popsicle was small and it was kinda expensive for my taste. I will def go back on a hot day for one.
Food,4.5,OR,"Quaint, lovely place to escape to read a good book, meet up with friends or work. Love the masala chai and the ""Chider (chai cider)"" in the fall. I bring family whenever they come to town. The lemon blueberry cake is delicious, as well."

Food,3.0,CG,"The staff It seems like they have the least interest in serving you. There is a person who doesn't know how to make the drinks. He then proceeds to say ""no, it's just a matter of personal preference."
Food,4.5,CG,My friend turned dirty 30 min early and the girl in front of us didn't even move the front door so we had to leave.   The lady was not wearing a mask and was just sitting in her car in the

Yesterday my drink wasn't even made right. It was too cold.

The person who waited on me was very nice.

Food,4.0,CG,Best liquor store in goleta.  The only problem is that it's close to the house and we go to the Publix a couple blocks away.  This store is very large and it's well stocked.
Food,4.5,CG,"Technically it's frozen custard, but it's the only custard I've ever had that I didn't like. 

If you're looking for some fun flavor combinations, you should definitely check this place out"
Food,4.5,CG,"We tried many gelato flavors and they were all very good. My husband tried a variety of flavors. We also had the cookie monster, which was very good. We had a lot of fun with the kids and we will"
Food,2.0,OR,"This place is the worst. The pretzel nuggets always have loads of butter at the bottom of the cup, the service is always super slow, and it's just not worth the price. Sometimes you really want a good pretzel - this is not the place."
Food,4.0,OR,"Sinfully decadent, their cookies go once past your lips and settles right at your hips. Insomnia cookies will satiate all cravings for warm chocolate cookies- my favorite being the M&M cookies and the original quintessential chocolate chip cookie. You won't be satisfied with just one!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Excellent Beer. It is a little loud, but everyone is nice. It is great to have a beer place this good so close by. If you want a quiet place to grab a beer, this isn't it yet. But with beer this good."
Food,4.5,OR,"I really wanted to like Old Road. 

Unfortunately, the way they treat their Black neighbors (while staying in the Treme/7th Ward, a historically Black neighborhood) is reprehensible, and the way they treat their Black employees is embarrassing. They're racist af.

The coffee's not that good either"
Food,2.5,OR,I am shocked at how slow this place is moving when no one is waiting in the drive through and there are four people staffing it. One person made drinks while we waited for fifteen minutes for our drinks. Not a good experience for us.
Food,2.5,OR,Okay first of all this place is good but one of the workers flipped me off I couldn't be more offended and I didn't even do anything I was trying to get my vente iced water my bad maybe she was having a bad day
Food,4.0,OR,I wish it would of been bigger for the price I paid and a lot more detailed or cleaner and the designs honestly looked sloppy I paid $695 for this cake and it sucks because they had good reviews and people recommended them to me.
Food,2.0,OR,"I ordered via the Dunkin app and showed up about 30 minutes later to pickup my order. When I showed up they hadn't even seen my order. I would understand if they were busy, but it didn't appear this place was any busier than normal."
Food,3.0,OR,"A small yet friendly winery. There was only about 5 wines available for tasting and purchase, but they were all quite good. The winery sits on a beautiful property with chickens and cats roaming the property. A little difficult to find, but worth the effort."
Food,3.5,OR,Love this place! Vacationing in Nashville and it's just as good as any other location I have been too! There so spot on 95% of the time! Make your own creation! Best way to go!! Employees are friendly! A little crowded! Great location easy parking!

They are also pretty slow... Don't ever go in when they have a long line."
Food,4.5,OR,"I've only recently started using this location - it has a prime location, but not relative to where I'm going to/coming from (east on Causeway). However, I've always been struck by how open and spacious the fueling area is, and the inside is incredibly clean."
Food,4.5,OR,"I enjoy Strangebrew. Always nice baristas, good coffee. I especially enjoy their cash discount and getting their fresh roasted coffee beans to take home. The aquariums keep my kids occupied while I drink my drink usually. Had lunch there a few times, never been disappointed."
Food,3.5,OR,"Even though are Smiths closer to me, this is the one I choose to go to.  It is clean, well stocked and usually easy to maneuver around and find things.  People are always friendly and willing to help me if I have questions."
Food,4.5,OR,My friend and I both got the hot chocolate. We were charged $4 each for what was just cheap hot chocolate mix (probably Swiss Miss) in frothed milk. What a rip-off. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is that this place had nice ambiance.
Food,4.0,OR,"Food and selection is second to none. However, I think they could do a better job of merchandising.  Too much clutter and the aisles are narrow. Cut short my visit because I was tired of being jostled. Went down the road to Trader Joe's"
Food,1.5,OR,No lines open at 8am. How does that happen? This store is always a mess and never has enough cashiers. But today is the last time I will try to shop here. Wal-Mart HQ needs to take a good look at this location. So pissed.
Food,3.5,CG,"The store itself is fine, but it's a little bit of a mess. The deli has a decent selection of products, but the deli is the worst part. The deli is always very busy and the lines are"

Food,1.5,CG,"Terrible. Girl at the drive thru window was rude and just kept staring at us for a few minutes.I had the opportunity to visit a few places in the area, and it was pretty nice to have a little breakfast in"
Food,4.5,CG,"Like its name this meat is an easy to find. I will say that the deli has a nice selection of the pre-made salads and sandwiches that you can't find anywhere else.

The store is clean and well"

I had the Chicken wings. The chicken wings were okay. The chicken wings were okay. The chicken wings were good"
Food,4.5,OR,"Epps has the best prices and the greatest owner. Give them your business. Carol is awesome. I love going there because it has that ""Cheers"" vibe even though it's just your neighborhood beer distributor. Well worth the stop thanks to their wide selection and fair pricing."
Food,2.5,OR,"They closed 1 hour early and would not let anyone in. The sales associate had an attitude when we walked up to the door and yelled at us and stated ""we are closed!"" They had no hours on the door and was not curious with explaining."
Food,2.5,OR,Their customer service was the best I've had at dunkin ever! I had my 4 year old daughter with me and they gave her 4 munchies for free. Then I asked for more hazelnut in my coffee and they had nothing but a welcoming and accepting

Food,4.5,OR,This ice cream place has a lot of very unique flavors. We ordered the Cookie Monster and the blueberry muffin top. The blueberry muffin top has crumble which makes it feel like you're having pie with your ice cream. I'll be back to try more flavors!
Food,4.0,OR,"The best bagel you can get outside of NYC! Crisp outside, soft and chewy inside and great flavor! I love their egg and everything especially! Great cream cheese favors too and egg sandwiches (lox OT sausage/egg/cheese.) My family even brings them home to PA with them!"
Food,3.5,OR,Very clean and friendly grocery store. They have many specialty items but they seem to be limited in their everyday items. I really like the deli sandwiches they make at publix. Their bread is great and it's hard to beat the boars head meat and cheese.
Food,4.5,OR,"Had a great cup of coffee here. I like the vibes of this cafe.. don't think it would be a good place to study, but a nice place to hang out. I also liked that they sold local goods, hot sauce and wooden items, it's cute."

Food,4.0,OR,"Good bakery however it would be really courteous to your customers to update your website. The marlton location has always been open Mondays, yet  upon driving here discovered it is now closed yet the website reflects Monday hours. Waste of my time and extremely frustrating."
Food,2.0,OR,"This 7-11 has all of your standard quick stop items. Its small, but clean and bright, and the staff is always nice. 
It's only one block away from Washington square, which makes it ultra convenient if you want a few snacks to eat in the park."
Food,3.0,OR,What a difference in a month. Thank you Mandy and Brad for making my experience at Sam's club better than initially experienced. The selection was worlds better. It's been a month of consistency which makes me happy to go and get my groceries and other purchases.
Food,4.5,OR,I ordered a deliver order and it was super smooth. The ice cream was amazing! It was the best ice cream I have had in a long time. The menu has a very cool avionics theme and it was just great! Payload is the best flavor!
Food,4.5,OR,This is a cute little spot in the Funk Zone. The red blends are really good and the mixed flight for tasting is the perfect assortment of flavors. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly . Def stop by the Funk Zone and try this place !
Food,4.5,OR,My wife and I visited Frutta Bowls today and we're really glad they are in the neighborhood. We liked the variety on the menu and the staff was really welcoming. Both the Frutta bowl and Go Toast were tasty and reasonably priced. We will be back.
Food,4.0,OR,Great ocean view but if you want some good wine there are other places nearby.  Do not waste your money on their wine unless you absolutely must sit there to enjoy the view.  Go the the Urban Wine Trail or go visit a winery!
Food,4.5,OR,"We tried the Lemon White Chocolate, Snickerdoodle, Rocky Road (Pictured), Triple Chocolate Blondie and the Nashville Hot. Y'all. The Nashville Hot was SO good. Kind of tasted like a Mexican Hot Chocolate. Chocolate goodness with a little kick is all I can explain."

The only thing I don't like about this place is the price. I go to go to a store and get"

The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and friendly. 

The only thing I wish they"
Food,2.0,CG,"I think peapod is great. Not sure if they have a good selection or if they have a bad selection. If you are looking for some basic items, this is the place to go."

Food,4.0,OR,Popped in for a beer or three and enjoyed each and every one.  Plenty of seating  games galore to entertain yourself with while you enjoy a beer. Played some old school Nintendo on the TV.  Excellent staff there made it a visit worth repeating.
Food,4.5,OR,"This was my favorite new (to me) place I visited on my vacation.  I saw it on a travel channel show years ago and had wanted to go ever since.  It didn't disappoint.  Great drinks, food, and music.  I highly recommend this place."

Both coffee and croissants were wonderful."
Food,4.0,OR,"We stopped in to grab a couple bottles of wine. They had a great selection- we found a number of favorites to pick from. We also found a French Bordeaux wine that we really like. Prices are fair, great selection, fast check out."
Food,3.5,OR,"Worst customer experience on planet earth. Lobby FULL of people nobody in masks. We waited over 20 minutes and the girls in back only filled to go orders. 

Cookies are great but dealing with the staff is a nightmare. They don't care about their customers at all!"
Food,3.5,OR,"I adore Costco and so does everyone else in Boise apparently. This store is well cared for and has great staff, but it's time to open a second Boise location. This one is too busy every time I go in now. Another location is long, long overdue."
Food,3.0,OR,"Somehow, Publix employees are always genuinely helpful. That's not easy to make happen in retail but here, helpful and friendly is the consistent mantra. The food is reasonably priced and there are always some kind of BOGO free kind of specials if you look.

I'll keep coming back."
Food,3.0,OR,"I like this giant store.

Some of the customers are weird though. *cough* snobs*cough

They do have a fresh deli counter, an American and a Chinese buffet. Place to sit and eat too! Soups/salad counter - but that's common.

What else? Your friendly neighborhood grocery market...  Doin it right."
Food,2.5,OR,"Coffee is decent, people seem friendly, but not very efficient. Long line moves pretty slow. Not entirely the staff's fault - some patrons pay cash and take awhile, but a sandwich does take quite a bit. Just plan ahead of time so you don't miss your flight!"
Food,4.0,OR,"i FINALLY found some sweet pineapple!! every store i've been to has some mediocre produce but wolfe's is spot on. everyone was very welcoming and attentive, can't wait to come back for some more great, cheap produce :) plus you get free bananas with a $10 purchase!"

Nice place to study n enjoy .
Definitely worth a look see even on a somewhat far trip ."
Food,3.0,OR,"Not a friendly staff. You have to ask for your receipt if you want it or they will never give it to you. When you do ask for it, they get frustrated with you. I like Starbucks but I have to avoid this one if I can."

Food,3.0,OR,"This Starbucks location is located in/next to the National Constitution Center which is a plus. 

No free/easy parking in the area so this spot is great for walking traffic.

The staff was nice.  They did not have cookies available so my son was disappointed.

I'll definitely be back."

Food,4.5,CG,"Love this place! Rotating seasonal flavors. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the customer service. I had the raspberry and banana, both were fantastic! I think the place is pretty small, but it's not too bad."
Food,5.0,CG,"Their coffee and hot chocolate are both top notch and you can't go wrong with the fruit one.I've had the best experience of my life with the Tuxedo. I've been to many other coffee shops in the area, and"

The store is in a very cool"

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The place is clean and modern.

This place is a great place to get ice cream"

Food,3.5,OR,"The selection of sundaes is creative, if not a bit overwhelming. How do you choose from all the goodness!?! Making the ice cream is quite a production and really enhanced my anticipation for the treat. Prices fit the quantity. I was more than satisfied splitting a Sunset. Delicious."
Food,3.0,OR,"Local and convenient, can usually find parking even though the lot is a bit compact and sometimes busy.  Selection and prices are what you expect at a state store which is ok but not great on both counts.  Wish this one was open on Sundays though."
Food,3.0,OR,"Became aware of this spot when my wife and I visited a location in Oxford, MS. Great selection of cookies to satisfy that sweet tooth craving. I went at like midnight and got two warm cookies. Hit the spot. Nice lil addition to the neighborhood."

Food,2.5,OR,"DON'T EVER go here if you're in a hurry.

No explanation, and no apology.

Food,3.0,OR,"Online it says they're open until 11, but when I got there just after 10 they were apparently closed. Not convenient when I went out of my way so I could get something I needed. You guys should make sure the hours that are displayed online are accurate."
Food,4.5,OR,"Dig the Pinot Noir here! And David is a hoot. The space is so chill and big. I want to have a party here. It has a real chill vibe, a nice break from the insanity of the urban wine trail. My second favorite was the Sauvignon Blanc."

Food,5.0,CG,"Cute spot. We just came here on a weekend night. It was pretty packed, but the staff was very friendly. 

We ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and it was pretty good. The cookies were not overly sweet, which"

Food,3.5,CG,"This Starbucks is always out of things, the drive thru is always backed up, the person taking my order is always very nice. The drive thru is usually very busy, it's pretty quick. They have a great rewards program which is always a"

Food,3.0,CG,"I tried this location again and it was fine. The employees were nice and the store was clean.I had the opportunity to visit a few places in the area, and it was pretty nice to have a little local coffee shop in the area."
Food,3.0,CG,"The sign for fresh chicken and meat, as well as the cold cuts, is the best one.

The cheese board was awesome. I had the cheese board and a couple of the chocolates. The cheese board was amazing. I'll definitely be back."
Food,2.0,CG,Gas attendant lady was rude and refused to let me try the cold brew for my drink.  I will never be back to this location.  The drinks are not made to order and the service is terrible.  I will be switching to Starbucks
Food,4.0,CG,I arrived a few moments before closing and the store was empty. When I got to the front of the store the lady at the register told me the store was closing. I was so upset and embarrassed.
Food,4.5,CG,"A delicious classic, always steadfast, and the quality is just what it's for. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I am a coffee lover, and I'm a coffee connoisseur."
Food,4.0,CG,"Life may be hard but it's the only one in Nashville that I can walk to. 

The employees are all nice, helpful and friendly, and the store is clean and well kept. 

There are a few coffee shops"
Food,4.0,CG,"Not my favorite cupcake place, but I am glad I did. 

The cupcakes are moist and delicious. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I think the place is pretty small, but it's not overly crowded so it's"

Food,4.5,OR,These are the most amazing cakes!  The staff works so hard to help you create the perfect cake for your celebration.  There's something for everyone!  Their little bundtinis are perfect for classroom treats or birthday parties.  Beautiful presentation and melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness!!!!  I've stopped baking!
Food,3.5,OR,"the workers were really nice! the tiger brown sugar drink (which I looked forward to trying the most) was underwhelming. the tapioca balls were really hard and too chewy the day that i went. i've heard really great reviews though, i could have just went on an off day!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Atmosphere is great. Cool place. I ordered the chicken skewer bowl. The flavors are on point. I would've given 5 stars, but one of the main ingredients (rice) was overcooked. So close to nailing it, but rice is not a hard thing to cook, and they blew it."
Food,2.5,OR,"Been here for spring break and in July...both visits had different crowds.  Spring break crowds made long lines, July crowds were just ""busy"".

Only got coffee each time.  Staff was courteous, fast, attentive.  

It's located in a tiny slot in a strip mall ... I mean tiny."
Food,4.5,OR,"Beyond awesome!  The BEST place to shop and purchase wine, beer and spirits.  Their selection is second to none, the prices are usually competitive AND they are exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Question for Total WIne Staff:  Do you ever get a shipment of Blanton's Bourbon?"

Food,4.5,OR,"I judge all coffee by the first sip, I judge great coffee by the last, cold, at the bottom of the cup. Handlebar Roasters coffee is GREAT. DRIVE, fly, walk or crawl if you have a hangover but, get there. I hate them for being closed on Sunday, bastards."
Food,4.5,OR,"If I lived in St Louis I would be here almost every day if I could. It's a great place to walk (exercise) and grab a book to read. 

I will have to emphasize this review later.. But it's a great place to visit for only EIGHT dollars!!! :)"
Food,1.5,OR,"Went for covid testing at this CVS on Oxford Valley Road. Filled out all the paperwork in advance online, set up an account, did the drive-thru testing, and waited 2 days only to find out that they lost the sample. How incompetent can you get."
Food,4.5,OR,"Hands down one of my favorite spots of late! This place has AMAZING croissants and baked goods. The vibe is really chill and the service is great! This spot gets pretty busy on the weekends so don't be turned off if there's a line, it's well worth the wait!"
Food,5.0,OR,I finally made my way out here for an afternoon treat. These pastries and donuts are large and fresh. I had the cinnamon caramel donut that they are known for. It was good. I would like to try some others as well as the jellies and other jarred goods.

Food,3.5,OR,"just moved to the area from the city and have been their 2x for miniature golf and driving range as well as ice cream.   this is what suburbs is all about. will be back frequently for golf range, batting cages, animal farm, ice cream, and miniature golf!"
Food,3.0,OR,"Standard grocery store with some of the organic options. They have the milk we use at lower prices than Whole Foods but they're often very close to being expired. Basically not our go-to grocery store, but when we need something quick it works since it's so close to home."
Food,4.0,OR,"Went with my boyfriend, both of us got coffee and a couple food items. The food items were delicious, and so was his blended coffee. My iced coffee was bland and bitter. The team also took 15 minutes to even acknowledge us standing at the counter waiting to order."
Food,2.5,OR,"Horrible service, Tamara,  the cashier was very rude, unwelcomed, the order wasn't right, food was overcooked. We came to Tampa from Orlando for fishing and were excited to stop here since the location was very close to our spot. Never again will do such a mistake."
Food,4.5,CG,"Came here after brunch because it's right by my house.

The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great. The place is small and small, but the inside is very large.

The menu is a bit overwhelming, but it"

Food,3.5,CG,Terrible service by the woman who helped me with my drink. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a bit of a coffee connoisseur and I don't like coffee.
Food,4.5,CG,Prices are very good and the staff is very helpful. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday. The lady behind the counter was very rude. She had no idea what to do.
Food,2.0,CG,"This is a starbucks inside the mall, with a drive-thru, drive-thru, and two locations inside the store. The drive-thru is very small, so it can get busy in the mornings."
Food,3.5,CG,"Meijer is where I'll do my shopping, and it's pretty much as good as it gets. The prices are competitive, and the staff is friendly and helpful. There are a lot of items that are cheaper elsewhere, and the produce is"

The bakery items are always fresh and delicious. The bakery items are also delicious!
I'm a fan!The best customer service in the world"

First of all, the coffee is good.

Second, the people who work here are super friendly. I am a coffee snob and have had great experiences here. I have had great service in the past"
Food,4.0,CG,5 stars because I lack time to explain the difference. I will admit that I am a regular. I am not a huge donut person and I have a couple of great donuts that I have had in the past. I am a regular customer
Food,3.0,CG,This Starbucks is so quick and friendly and the food is good. The only thing I wish they had was a drive through. The drive through line was a bit long but it was worth it.
Food,4.5,CG,Love that they've been able to expand the space and expand their space. There's a large patio and a big patio. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is so chill.I'm so excited to see this place open in the near future

Food,3.5,CG,"I am so glad that this place exists. It is a little on the pricier side, but worth it.

Mead.  Its a sweet, sweet, and flavorful cold brew that is perfect for the summer.  The beers are also delicious.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The place is well kept and clean"
Food,3.5,CG,I was really disappointed... Whole Foods has the best produce in the area. There is a large selection of other items.  The bakery is also very good.  There are a lot of items that are organic and not in the organic section. 
Food,4.5,CG,"Oh Urban South - what's better than the wide variety of choices? 

The fruit and veggies here are top-notch, and they're fresh and tasty. The prices are a bit high, but the quality is worth it."
Food,4.5,OR,"Yes!  A little hard to find but totally worth it! Great beer and service, byo food or call ahead to see if there is a food truck that day. Excellent and very convenient location once you find it- drive all the way to the back of the parking lot!"
Food,3.5,OR,WAY too expensive. Ice cream is good but the prices are outrageous. $11 for a sundae. $7 for a soft serve cone. If I had just walked a little farther to the seaport museum I would have seen the ice cream truck with a large variety and very reasonable prices.
Food,4.0,OR,"Great snoballs, but the attitude of some of the little girls  that work there is terrible.  Please, how may I help you and thank you need to be added to their vocabulary.  Extremely rude, if you don't know how to smile then don't work with the public."
Food,4.0,OR,"Great selections, high concentration of hoppy beers.  The bartender was sassy and super helpful. Just ask if you want to try something, beers range from $3-$6.  The BBQ and mac n cheese was also super rich and delicious. It paired well with the beers and was super convenient."
Food,3.5,OR,I did expect more from a hotel of this caliber. The rest of the hotel was great. Only issues I had was with Teddy Cafe. Service wasn't the best as it was slow and some folk had attitude . Fountain Lounge was better overall.  The baked goods were ok.
Food,4.5,OR,"They have a variety of candy selection I opted for gummy worms, taffy, nerds, and some milk chocolate candy for the family over all lots of choices and very delicious they also sell things to drink and fudge. They have a sugar free section as well over all good stuff"
Food,4.0,OR,"Too shallow. Not for diving. Need a deeper wine list and more knowledgeable bartenders. Service sucked. 
The beer list was longer and more pronounced on the menu. The bartenders' knowledge of wine on tap and wine available was shockingly lacking. 

Won't return. So many other good wine spots popping up."
Food,4.0,OR,What amazing flavors and creations! I wait week by week to try the newest indulgence and I have yet to be disappointed. The staff here is wonderful and Natalie is sweeter than the cookies and such a helpful delight! Stop by to be treated to the sweetest treats and service!!
Food,4.5,OR,"This was a really cool experience! It was our first distillery tour, and it was a great start. The cocktails made on site are delicious, and staff is very knowledgeable! We got to taste their popular offerings and also tried specialty flavors. Would come back for drinks from their bar."
Food,3.5,OR,"The baristas and staff here are wonderful.  Always cheerful and efficient and such a nice way to start your morning. I just had a ""pay if forward"" moment when I forgot my wallet and a barista covered the cost of my coffee.  Sometimes it's just the little things!"
Food,4.5,OR,"This is our most favorite water ice place. They are far far better than Rita's and south Philly's. Their Cherry Bordeaux has chunky cherries. The ice is soft and not watery. The only thing is we always have to wait in long line, and the  parking space is tight."
Food,3.0,OR,"Jason, thank you for all your help with picking out a good selection of on-sale beverages; the case of champagne-ish Confidence & Integrity was a win! Several bottles have been gifted already. Again, thanks!

Convenient location, small number of sale items -- perfect if you find what you need, helpful staff."
Food,3.5,OR,"I would like to say the staff are very friendly. Overall great customer service. The decoration of the dessert was amazing, but disappointing when I ate the strawberry cheesecake. The shake itself was not great. I'm a dessert fanatic & I've had amazing shakes. This one wasn't what I expected."
Food,4.0,OR,Great local dive bar! Stopped in while I was working in the area. Folks are friendly. Easy to jump in a conversation. Bartenders are top notch. Very attentive. Never had to wait for a beer. Plenty of tvs for sports. Overall great place. Stop in if you get a chance.
Food,3.5,OR,"My wife and I are from Illinois, we come down here twice a year to enjoy the weather and the beach. I just want to say that this Winn-Dixie is one of the best grocery store for there Deli and fresh food. A small quaint store, with very friendly people."
Food,4.5,OR,"The pretzels had perfectly rough, resilient exteriors and blissfully raised, chewy interiors. The price was almost bafflingly low. A man in a garage served the delicacies expediently, in a brown paper bag that would have hid my purchase from wandering eyes had I not consumed two greedily, on the spot."
Food,2.5,OR,"This is the worst Starbucks. Staying at the hotel for a conference, it's closed Mondays & Tuesdays and closes at noon the rest of the week. I get that there's a personnel problem right now but come on. You break from meetings & want coffee and you can't get it."
Food,3.0,CG,The store was right across from a bakery. We were also greeted by a couple of other customers. The bakery was clean and the staff was friendly. The customer service desk was very helpful in making suggestions.

Food,4.5,CG,This is a great brewery. We have been here several times and it's always a great time. The atmosphere is great and the people are always friendly and helpful. There are a lot of different types of beer on tap. The staff is always friendly.
Food,4.5,CG,"It's unfortunate we only have one of the two locations in Nashville. 

The first one is a little off the beaten path, but that is the only reason why it is so bad. The parking lot is in a very small strip mall."
Food,4.5,CG,Best bubble tea place in Tampa. The drinks are good but not as good as the other bubble tea places. The drinks are also not as good as the ones in the city.I'm so excited to have found this place in the Tampa Bay Area.
Food,4.5,CG,"This place is huge. There are a lot of cool things to see around here, including a pretty cool garden. The beers are great, and they're dog friendly, so you can go here with your friends and family."

Food,4.5,CG,"They definitely know how to make an amazing cake.  I will definitely be using this bakery again.I've had the best donuts at the grocery store ever, and it's pretty much the best.  It's a little pricey, but it's"

Food,3.0,CG,"The bubble tea was great, the service was very friendly and the drinks were really good! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty bubble tea in Chinatown!The customer service is great. The staff is always friendly."
Food,4.0,CG,"I absolutely loved my experience here. The owner, Tara, was very kind and the wine was fantastic. The only thing I didn't like about the wine was the price. I would definitely go back. It's a good value for the experience."
Food,4.0,CG,"Well, I guess there ARE better options in the area. I saw a lot of people ordering the same thing from the Publix, but they're still out of the same thing as the regular Publix.

I will say that the"
Food,4.0,CG,"A small Vietnamese grocery store, but the quality and quality of the produce is just the same. The prices are competitive with other stores, but they're cheaper than most. The produce is fresh, and the store is in a very nice location."

Food,4.0,OR,"If you're heading here for a tour and drinking, save your appetite because the BBQ is EVERYTHING. Make this your lunch/dinner as well. 

The pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese are delicious with the Jersey BBQ sauce - or the Texas BBQ sauce if you're feeling a little more spice."
Food,4.5,OR,"Definitely one of the best, if not the best, local coffee shop I've ever visited. Beans are freshly roasted and ground everyday and the owner and his son are generally always around and full of friendly coffee knowledge. I highly recommend this place to anyone with a taste for great coffee!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Truly sugar heavenly bliss in a bite! My first cronut ever & first time at Five Daughters bakery was magical. I wish I was a local to try more flavors.
Very lovely design--king kong cronut--bacon and maple flavors. I liked the sweet/salty combo.  I think it would taste even better hot!"
Food,2.0,OR,"This place has the slowest drive-thru, ever! They're always out of items, and they never get my order right. Also, it's incredibly unprofessional when I can hear the conversation through the speaker. Also, when I opened up my bagel, I found a hair. Disgusting! New management is what this establishment needs."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great selection of both wine, beer, and liquors! Staff is always friendly and helpful! Really cool store as it used to be a old bank! They also do delivery which is awesome! As well they have tastings daily and also special events occasionally if you are apart of their royalty program."
Food,3.5,OR,"Love it here, they have all fresh veggies, fruits, icecream, etc etc! My favorite thing about coming here (in season) is when You can harvest your own veggies, fruits and flowers!! The hayride to the harvest locations is a nice relaxing short ride. I can definitely recommend this place to anyone."
Food,4.0,OR,"I think it is the best Publix great neighborhood, parking garage. Plenty of healthy fare, a good competition for whole foods. It's a big store so a little of just about everything. I still am not a fan of Publix meats. Plenty of organic choices. A huge fan of this store."
Food,2.0,OR,This Dunkin Donuts is great. The drive through is quick and the staff is friendly. They participate in the 99 cent refills which is a big plus. It's not close to my house but I go out of my way to visit this location instead of the one closer to me.
Food,4.0,OR,"They have quite a variety of hand-dipped ice cream, as well as soft serve selections.  Some thing for everyone as well as many varieties of cones.  It's a nice little shop and it also offers candy items to. They had outdoor seating, a place to enjoy your ice cream."
Food,4.5,OR,"The owner was very friendly. She allowed us to try a sample before purchasing. I bought the Strawberry Banana Pudding. It was delicious!! It was so light and fluffy with a nice mix of fresh fruit, pudding, and vanilla wafers. I will definitely have it again when I'm back in Philly!"

Food,4.5,OR,"I had stopped by to pick up a few items several times but today I finally had a chance to ask about the vegetables. I was pleased to learn that all the vegetables are local. :). The price is right too! 

The nursery looks night and the place is well kept."
Food,4.5,OR,"I discovered this gem a couple of months ago.  I love the fact they have almond milk as an option for we vegan folk.   Everyone is friendly, service is top notch.  The coffee is so much better than the competition.   Keep up the good work!!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Really tasty but does not offer a military discount, too bad.  The floats are amazing but not enough soda to outlast the ice cream.  Servings are ginormous so come with an appetite or consider sharing.  The food is really good and a great place to take your family."
Food,4.0,OR,"I like doughnuts, but these things are just way too sweet. They do have a big selection. The doughnuts are in the Voodoo-style (lots of toppings, like cereal, bacon, candy). If you're a fan of really sugary doughnuts, then it might be worth a shot -- personally I don't recommend it."
Food,3.0,OR,"I am handicapped. This store has parking a walk away from the door, no motorized carts usually available, I think they only have 2. Policy regarding coupons not friendly if you forget to use the coupons day of purchase. I used to love Target but now, they are like other stores."
Food,2.5,OR,Long lines and horribly mismanaged. Today understaffed for second time in restaurant and sold me a drink cup but literally no drinks available. Person behind counter said manager was notified 45 min ago. I asked two staff including member desk for manager and was told no one knew where on was.
Food,4.5,OR,"We accidentally found this place because my brother noticed it when we went to Cajun Kitchen across the street for breakfast. I had the single scoop of Sri Lankan cinnamon in a waffle cone. Generous portion, great flavor, sturdy cone, definitely a richer ice cream. I want to try more flavors."
Food,4.5,CG,"You ever eat something and eat it, you will thank me later. The fruit and veggies are so fresh and delicious. The cakes and pies are amazing, the place is so cute, and the owners are so sweet."
Food,3.0,CG,"You really can do much better than the quality and quality of the produce at Whole Foods. 

The employees are always helpful, friendly and polite, and the store is always clean. 

You can get a large organic section for about $5"
Food,5.0,CG,The best kielbasa I have had in the area. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I recommend coming here and grabbing a Kielbasa and then the sandwiches are delicious. I will definitely be coming back to this location.
Food,4.5,CG,"I wish I would have asked for more. Anyway, my friend and I decided to go get some beers and some beers. The place was clean and the staff was nice. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the atmosphere."
Food,3.5,CG,"A strange fake farm. Everything looks old and the produce is old. Also, the bakery is horrible. I wish they had a bakery, but they're awful. I'm a fan of this place. I love the flavors and the service."
Food,4.5,CG,"This is one of my favorite bars in the area. I always come here for the chill vibe. It's not the best place for a good beer, but it's great for a nice place to hang out with friends. I've been here for years and"
Food,5.0,CG,"What can I say other than that, the ice cream is really good! The variety of flavors is a bit overwhelming, but I am glad that they have a ""good"" ice cream shop in the downtown area. Definitely a place to come for some frozen yogurt"
Food,4.5,CG,Really good ice cream. Very friendly staff and the ice cream is creamy and delicious. I would recommend. I've been going to this location for years and have never been disappointed. I go here with my family and we get a large iced coffee.
Food,5.0,CG,We had THE BEST TIME! We will be back!Very good smoothies! The guy working the front is so nice and the place is clean and inviting!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh.
Food,5.0,CG,"Best Authentic Tunisian food and wine. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The owner, Steve, is the rudest person you'll ever meet. They are so rude to customers and will never be back"
Food,2.0,CG,The worst! Went inside to grab a couple of cases of wine and left with a bottle of champagne. Went back inside and waited for a manager to come over and let me know how long it would take to get the bottle. I will never shop here again
Food,4.0,CG,"I'm glad I got to go back and try the other flavors. 

The fruit flavors are a little too sweet for my liking.  The coconut flavor is a bit strong and I don't like coconut.  The flavor is very subtle. "
Food,2.0,CG,"How does one location have a better selection of wine and liquor? 

The wine and liquor sections are top notch and the staff is friendly and helpful. The store is clean and well stocked."
Food,4.5,CG,We went to have our wedding cake and the girl at the bakery was so sweet! We ordered the red velvet cupcakes and the cake was beautiful and the cupcakes were great! The cakes were so beautiful and the icing was so fresh! The customer service was

Food,4.5,CG,"This is THE best birthday cake I have ever had. I will be going back for sure!Great coffee and great atmosphere! I am a coffee lover, and this place is definitely a treat. They have a great selection of pastries, coffee drinks, and"
Food,2.5,OR,Worst customer service I have ever encountered. Would have liked to have given them a zero but honestly they do deliver if you have the patience of a saint. If you are prone to ulcers please do not try calling the pharmacy. You may not live long enough to get a response.
Food,4.5,OR,"Once again Dierbergs is head and shoulders above the rest.  Was looking for Halloween cake mix and icing.

The manager took the time to personally go look for it, found it and set aside 2 boxes for me at customer service.

It's little things  like this that keep my family shopping there"
Food,3.5,OR,"I usually do my grocery shopping at wegmans,  but followed a friend to whole foods to do some shopping.   Definitely higher prices.  Definitely lots of unique brands available and very tempting to try them,  but their 365 house brand is the way to go to ""save"" money."
Food,3.0,OR,"Stopped in on the weekend in the morning, stood in a long line while a customer debated why his coupon and discount wasn't honored. The other customers waited for minutes, even though there were other employees who could have took orders, got disgusted and walked out."
Food,4.0,OR,Cookies are awesome!  They serve them warm which is a nice touch.  I gave 4 stars because the guy behind the counter was one of the most unpleasant people ever!  He was surfing the net when we walked in and took a couple of minutes to even acknowledge us.
Food,3.0,OR,"Great tour with Lisa tonight! Wish I were in town for a weekend tour, which she said is even more focused on voodoo. She was very knowledgeable and offered a lot of insight and details about the city's history. I especially enjoyed hearing about the haunted hotel and walking on the grounds."
Food,3.5,OR,I love this liquor store.  Everyone is so kind and knowledgeable about the items they carry.  I even went into the store once and they were giving tastings of wines and liquors.  I also really enjoy that they carry some beers that you would not find at most places.
Food,4.0,OR,"I can honestly say I do not review many Starbucks because they seem to be all the same however, this location is a must see. It is more of a work of art in such a large space. They also have open make music with plenty a room to sit every Saturday"
Food,4.5,OR,"Blue. Velvet. Cupcake. Nothing else like it. My friend got married and had a 3 layered,each a different flavor vegan cake from here. I knew when I tasted it I'd be going to the bakery. It is SO SO good. Everything I've had is delicious."
Food,5.0,OR,Love love love this place! They have like 8 vegan gelato places. The location and pricing is amazing - for $5 I got to try two flavors! I got the vegan almond and key lime pie - they were some of the best I've ever had. I hope this place sticks around.
Food,4.5,OR,"I must say in the most humblest way possible, this place blows... their brown nosing commercials projecting the ignorant family of ownership make me want to puke, I was met with the most rude and arrogant tone by the staff and have heard stories of this place treating employees poorly
BIG THUMBS DOWN"
Food,3.0,OR,"Large Starbucks right near 476 - so fairly convenient but the trafic at rush hour is bad.  Drive thru is available but we opted to order inside (and use the restrooms).

No issues.

Got in and out fairly quickly.  Parking lot was PACKED.

Alex (cashier/barista) was very good.
Seating area was clean and comfy."
Food,5.0,OR,"Incredible produce, fresh seafood, prime meats, and prepared foods! If you're in the Wyndmoor area, make sure to stop in. Captain Andy is a master of his craft and always willing to give a recommendation when you're at a loss of what to choose from (hint: you can never go wrong here)."
Food,4.5,OR,"a must-go if you are in st louis. you get to see the famous clydesdale horses, learn a little about the beer making process and AB history. the tour is about 90 minutes and you get two free beers at the end. i was impressed by the architectural beauty of the factory."
Food,2.5,OR,"Hey it's Walgreens... but here we go:

The GOOD: 
OPEN 24 hours (one of very few places #intheNOLAbaby that is
Location is central, easy to access
Lots of good, quick finds
Lots of New Orleans Branded Touristy items
Lite-weight security


The BAD:
The prices are a little more than the average Walgreens


The UGLY:
The check out lines always SUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!


Easy Peasy!!!!!"
Food,4.5,OR,Love this place! Me and some others took our friend here for a birthday celebration. It was such a classy and relaxing place for us girls to be. I love the vibe. Just a really nice and modern place. I highly recommend it. The cat and the hat cocktail is really good!

Food,4.5,CG,"Ok, I love ice cream, but I wouldn't make this a regular stop for me. 

I am a huge fan of ice cream, and I think this place is pretty cool. They have a few flavors, so it was a nice surprise when"
Food,2.5,CG,"Went to clinic and they had an appointment with a new insurance company. When I got to the front desk, the woman said the new insurance company is running out of the same medication and that it's only in the system. I said they can't do it"
Food,5.0,CG,"Very small sit in area, but the coffee is good.

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The place is a bit small, but the inside is very clean and comfortable.

The only thing I would change is the seating area."
Food,4.0,CG,"The apple beignets were overhyped. Not sure if they were fried but it was delicious. I would recommend.I've had the best donuts at the grocery store ever, and it's pretty much the best.  It's a little pricey for"

Food,4.5,CG,I went in when empty handed. The employee who helped me was nice and personable. The ice cream is very creamy and creamy and the flavor of the ice cream is so smooth. I tried the peanut butter flavor which was absolutely delicious.
Food,4.0,CG,"I see that all the time it's busy, but I will admit that it's been pretty difficult to get in and out of the parking lot. The parking lot is a bit small but it's well worth the walk. I've been there for years and always"
Food,4.5,CG,Great little neighborhood deli / bakery. The bakery is very good. The salad bar is awesome and the bakery items are very fresh. The cakes and muffins are great. The staff is very helpful and friendly. It's a very busy place.
Food,4.5,CG,"I've only ever gotten ground beef here, and it's pretty good.

The only thing I wish they had was a little more organic foods, but if you're a fan of that, then this is the place to go.I absolutely love this place"
Food,3.0,CG,"Employees are very friendly and helpful. The only downside is that it's close to the park and we have yet to find a spot, but that is okay if you're a local. We'll be back soon.The best doughnuts ever! I love how"
Food,4.0,CG,"Not very friendly staff. The cashier was rude and seemed annoyed that I didn't have to pay. I had the opportunity to visit a few places in the area, and it was pretty nice to have a little breakfast in the neighborhood."
Food,4.5,CG,"Great place to go to grab a beer with friends. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I recommend coming here. Great beers and great location. 

I think this place is a great place to get a few beers. I would come back for the beer."
Food,3.5,CG,The water ice is just perfect. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the service is a little slow. The people behind the counter are the most rude and unprofessional people I've encountered. It's not even a bad experience.
Food,4.0,CG,Recently went when the store was opened and the store was pretty clean. There were a few employees. I think the employee was the manager. He was the manager. He was very polite and helpful. I went in to buy a few items and some frozen items.
Food,4.5,CG,"Extremely late review, but we had an amazing time! We had a great time, the wine was fantastic, and we had a great time.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, and we had a great time.  The wine was delicious and the staff"
Food,4.0,CG,Hands down the BEST ice cream in the world! The employees are always so kind and accommodating and the atmosphere is always very cute. The ice cream is the best in the city and it's worth the visit. It's a little pricey but it's worth it
Food,4.0,OR,"I come here every Halloween with my nephews for their school trip.  I always have a blast with the hay ride,  pumpkin picking and corn maze.  there was another section closed off though that id love to try next year.  oh yeah feeding the goats is always awesome :)"
Food,4.0,OR,"Tried this place out for the first time and had the blood orange spritzer drink - can't remember the exact name of it - but it was delicious! It was not too sweet, had great flavor, and was definitely refreshing. I'm sure their other drinks are just as tasty. Super cool decor too."
Food,2.0,OR,Been standing at the register for 5 min and still haven't been greeted or talked to while I listened to a bunch of girls laugh and joke around in the back. Brendan ran up and took my order and was very present and invited me back. He is the reason for my return.
Food,2.0,OR,"Seeing Jennifer's review reminded me to do this. So it is so much nicer with the redone deli, bakery and produce area. That is where I spend most of my time. There is not a lot of options for grocery stores in the area and this one has been sufficiently improved."
Food,4.0,OR,"I really liked the aesthetic feel of this place. I got here around 3pm to try it out, but it was kind of a bummer that they didn't have a lot of options even though they don't close till 11pm. Thus far, the fruity pebble donut and nutella one would be worth trying!"
Food,4.5,OR,A great beer distributor that caters to all tastes with a selection ranging from local craft beers to imports and the crappy stuff (if you're into that). The staff is friendly and helpful and if they don't have what you want they'll try their hardest to get it for you from the distributor.
Food,4.5,OR,i loved the amount they give you and the custard was good the toppings were fun and the service was fast when i got there the place was swamped but cleared up quickly. but i didnt really see anyplace to sit maybe i missed it in the crowed. over all worth the money.
Food,3.0,OR,"This location is right next to my house. I find myself driving to Arnold because Fenton just can't seem to understand what you are ordering 

And it is always the same thing:
(2) Peanut Power Plus with wellness packet
And 
(2) Yogurt D Light double strawberry 

Don't see why they can NEVER get it correct‍"
Food,4.5,OR,"Great tour! Tracy was awesome. We just had the best afternoon.
Tracy took us to 3 wineries- one of them wasn't on the initial agenda but she asked us our preference along the way and it turned out that her recommendation was fabulous. We would definitely take this tour again when back in SB."
Food,4.5,OR,"Good wine. Remarkably bad service. I mean incredibly bad. Embarrassingly bad. Condescending, rude, argumentative, hostile person behind the counter. It is too bad because I am a fan of the wine and even know the winemaker a bit socially, but I won't be going back in there unless there are some real changes."
Food,4.5,OR,"I was in town for business and found this little gem. The staff is really friendly, the coffee is delicious, and the burrito hit the spot. I got the French Press coffee with maple hints. It was quiet and cozy, and I was able to work out of this spot, too."
Food,3.0,OR,"The absolute worst staff of pharmacist I've ever seen, the lack of help or even attempt to acknowledge people. Gentleman before kept asking for assistance after standing there for 10 minutes without being acknowledged family one woman passed him by and says I'm too busy to help, what kind of crap is that"
Food,4.5,OR,Awesome donuts  and breakfast sandwiches !!! The food is super fresh and yummy. The person behind the counter was so kind.  She was super sweet to my son. The selection is awesome and the place is just super clean. I highly recommend this place. My family and I will be back.
Food,3.5,OR,I like to get coffee from this starbucks. The baristas  are very friendly and polite. Typically I go there when I want to take some break from my school work. They have nice outside area that you can sit and wait for your drink. It is a crowded place to work inside
Food,3.0,OR,"Awful. Dry, flavorless, bland. I had the ""Plain Jane"", vanilla with vanilla cake. Plain, true but they can do better. The icing is whipped cream, not buttercream. Small cupcakes and too expensive for the lack of quality and poor customer service. The cashier gave my mom the wrong change, and never rectified it."
Food,4.0,OR,"Best ice cream I've ever had! The line can get crazy because it's in the Reading Terminal Market, but the Guatemalan Ripple (coffee/chocolate) and Gadzooks! (choc/caramel/peanut butter) are absolutely worth the wait. They also give you a crazy amount of ice cream, and i can almost never finish a whole cone by myself!"
Food,5.0,OR,"First time here and I am not a bourbon/whiskey person (until now!). Very educational tour from our tour guide Grayson. He was very informative and knowledgeable. The different types of whiskey were extremely delicious and flavorful. Even if you aren't into alcohol or hard liquor, I would go here just for the experience!"
Food,4.0,CG,"This is a hidden gem in an industrial park. It's a lovely little spot to just grab a cup of coffee and get a bite to eat while you're in the mall. If you like coffee, this is your place."
Food,4.0,CG,This place is absolutely adorable and has the best ice cream I've ever had. I went with the Strawberry and the Butter Pecan. The butter pecan was sooooooo good. I also had the chocolate peanut butter which was very good.
Food,3.0,CG,"Strange Donuts has become the go-to place for me.

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. The donuts are always fresh and delicious!

My favorite donut is the lavender donut. The lavender donut is the best don"
Food,4.0,CG,We went here a while back and the bartender was super nice and friendly! He was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the beers and the beers. He also provided a great tour of the brewery and it was a great way to start a weekend. I wish I had taken pictures
Food,4.5,CG,"Not impressed; staff wasn't very friendly. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the customer service. I had an employee open the door at 6:30 and the store was closed. The cashier had her hand in the door, and it was not ready"
Food,3.5,CG,Had a late night craving for a nice coffee and decided to stop by for a drink.  The atmosphere is super cute and the staff was very friendly.  There was a lot of seating inside and outside.  I got a iced coffee with oat milk and
Food,4.0,CG,"World class icecream shop!!! It's an amazing place to try out all the flavors and the staff is always so friendly. 

I love that they have a rewards program where you get free icecream and they accept credit cards which is always a plus! This"
Food,4.5,CG,"When you charge almost $4 for a single scoop, you're paying a premium for the size you get. 

If you want a small, basic flavor, you can get it at a grocery store in the area. I would suggest getting one if you're"
Food,3.0,CG,"Yum! Had their BLT. Very good. The only reason I didn't give this place a 4 star is because the service was a little slow. Not sure if it was because of the other reviews, but it seemed like a good experience."
Food,3.5,CG,Outstanding service!! I love all the flavors and the taste. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in at around 3:15pm and they had a sign on the door that said they were closed. It was clear that they were closed.
Food,4.5,CG,The glazed donut here is the best I've ever had. The staff is friendly and the coffee is top notch. I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh.
Food,3.0,CG,"I used to always love this place, but now they've got a lot of the stuff you can't get at Publix, including the sushi section. 

The store is clean and well stocked. 

I do recommend this place to anyone."
Food,4.0,CG,This place makes amazing bubble tea. The fruit tea is good but not spectacular. I would recommend the other two. I think they're the best bubble tea place in town. The customer service is excellent. The staff is extremely friendly.
Food,3.5,CG,"I like this gas station, it's convenient and has a great produce section. I go there to get my oil and vinegar. The prices are reasonable, and the store is clean and well kept. I love the fact that I can get a carwash with my car"
Food,2.0,CG,"called this dunkin donuts at this location and let me just say it's my go to! 

The employees are always nice, and they're quick to serve you a donut that you don't want.

Food,4.5,CG,"This is a great, inexpensive, local bakery with a great variety of cupcakes, cookies, cupcakes, cakes, cookies, cakes, cakes and cakes. There are a lot of cakes to choose from and the flavors are always fresh."
Food,4.5,CG,This is the only ice cream place I've ever been to. The shop is adorable and so cute. The staff is always friendly and the shop is so cute. There's a small parking lot and a good amount of seating.
Food,2.5,CG,Excellent customer service especially the woman behind the counter.  I will not be going back to this location.  I had a friend from out of town that was visiting from out of town and we were told this location was open on a Sunday.  This was disappointing.
Food,3.5,CG,This business just started delivering some of the best ice cream I have ever had. I have been to other locations in the area but this one is by far the best. The staff is always friendly and helpful. It's a great addition to the area.
Food,4.0,OR,"I have been ordering my mangoes from Savani Farms for 3 years and have been satisfied.  Not one of the mangoes came spoilt although they maybe a little small sometimes.  Buying from the local grocer meant cheaper pries, but generally some spoilt product so I prefer buying from Savani Farms directly online."
Food,4.5,OR,"As a fellow NYer (Hudson Valley represent!), there's nothing I love more than a decadent slice of cheesecake - and this place always delivers! I enjoy ordering their slices from the comfort of my couch via UberEats and gobbling them down in the privacy of my home. Thank you for feeding my gluttonous cravings!"
Food,2.0,OR,Stopped in here during a conference we had in Nashville. We were staying at the Omni so this location is on the opposite side of the entrance from the hotel. It was a quick walk and our service was friendly and fast. You cannot use Starbucks rewards here though. Nice little seating areas too.
Food,3.0,OR,"Hours posted are 9pm. Kids working wouldn't
Open the door @8:50pm. If hours are or have been changed THEY SHOULD BE POSTED. 
This used to be a great place to stop & get ice cream as a family. It's open so inconsistently why bother stopping by anymore.
Very disappointed in how Delsa's is being run now."
Food,4.0,OR,"I was so happy when dutch bros finally opened up in Tucson. The menu here is beyond huge, but you can only see it online, which is a little annoying. My go to drink is the iced kicker. Really good if you like Irish creme. I wish there was a location closer to me!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Wow!  How am I just discovering this place today.  One of the best bagel sandwiches (cheddar everything, veggie cream cheese, and tomato)  I've had in the area and perhaps all of philly.  The ice latte was equally delicious.  I won't go anywhere else for my bagels.  Well done."
Food,4.0,OR,"This is a great coffee shop with some amazing outdoor seating.  They know how to make a Cortado very well. They can make it on ice or hot. Of course I also make most of the other traditional drinks that people are more familiar with like cappuccino, latte, iced coffee, pour over etc."
Food,2.5,OR,"Was the plan to move into an underserved community and exploit them. I noticed the prominent surveillance immediatedly. I wasn't surprised by that.....still the store appears to be struggling. Staff complaining. Produce and other spoiled perishables on the floor. And rude employees. ( not the females ) So bad, I won't go any more."
Food,4.5,OR,Love it. Just moved in around the corner and I've been here a few times-- all the baristas are super nice and the espresso is really good. My only tiny complaint is $1 for alternate milk (they have Oat and I think almond) is just enough to make me think twice about my order.
Food,5.0,OR,Awesome service!  Called after hours on a Monday night and they were willing to do the errand immediately.  Saved my life and made my day.  Not to mention they're very reasonably priced.  I will most definitely be using Reno On The Go Delivery again!  Thank you thank you :)
Food,2.0,OR,I didn't care for this place. Aside from the the aesthetics of the place it wasn't great. The frozen yogurt came out waaay to fast! (Heavy Pour) Also they have generic brand toppings I. E. The generic brand Recees cups. Yuck! For $. 50 an oz... At least provide customers with brand name toppings!
Food,4.5,OR,5. 1 stars. See what I did there? I really don't understand the snobby a-holes complaining that they didn't get new glasses between tastes. NONE OF THE TASTING ROOMS AROUND HERE DO THAT!! Step up off your broom handle seat and come to Area 5. 1 for some tasty wine and fun staff.
Food,4.0,OR,"Very friendly staff. They seem to genuinely want everyone to enjoy their ice cream. I was a little surprised by how many different options they had for ice cream. Fortunately, they encouraged me to sample whatever sounded good. 

And most importantly, everything I sampled was actually really good. I can't wait to go back."
Food,4.5,OR,"Nice variety. I really enjoyed the people, the atmosphere and the quality. I did find $12 for a plate of food kind of pricey and $5 for one piece of chicken, way over the top. A dozen donuts over $12. Hopefully some vendors will compromise on the pricing. Too much competition for downtown prices."
Food,1.0,OR,Very friendly staff however very slow...and 50% the order is wrong. The parking is horrible dude to squeezing this store beside the Salty Shamrock which people who go to Salty's park in the Starbucks parking the drive thru line is backed up which blocks you in. Will be a while before I go back.
Food,4.5,OR,We were pleasantly surprised by this gem. We had never seen traders brewing advertised so didn't know much about them. The beer was actually really good though and the tap room was cool with tons of space. The bartender was so nice and friendly and made us feel like regulars.
Food,3.0,OR,Great store always clean and organized good selection and better meats then larger groceries like shop rite and acme also better handled and noticeable bakery is great to and always fresh produce and fruit fresh and don't rott quick like at large groceries you'll find everything you need here with our spending a lot
Food,2.0,OR,This entire crew that works here is the rudest I've ever seen. And incompetent Sunday morning at 11am and they're out of donuts! Out of donuts? Serious? 7 employees and they're running around like crazy. someone needs to train these people. I see why their stores Yelp is so low.
Food,3.0,OR,Extremely inefficient and slow service. Took 10 minutes to get my latte this morning with only one person waiting in front of me. I'll only come here if I have time to kill. Then again if I have time to kill then I would go somewhere with better coffee and a more relaxing environment.
Food,5.0,CG,"Such a great, great place. We will be back!Very good ice cream! The variety of flavors is a bit limited but the staff is helpful and friendly!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get"

The staff is always so friendly and the ice cream is delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. 

You can get a large scoop of ice cream if you want to"

Food,4.5,CG,This little cute donut shop that has the best donuts I've ever had. I was just in town visiting family and I wanted a treat and decided to go to this place. This place is located in an adorable area of downtown Nashville. There are a few tables inside
Food,3.5,CG,"Love this place. Has a great selection of wine and liquor. There is a wine store. There is a wine store, a cheese and bakery. There is a large selection of liquor. It's a little pricey for a liquor store."
Food,5.0,CG,"From start to finish, jump on the floor and walk out.

The cheese section is awesome.

The deli is a solid 5 star place.

They have a nice selection of meats and cheeses.

I can't wait to come back"
Food,2.5,CG,"There are always drug addicts here. The only problem is that it's close to the house, but I guess it's a convenience store. 

I think the place is pretty nice. It's in a really good part of town. If you're looking for something"
Food,5.0,CG,So first off it's family friendly. The owner is super nice and friendly. He's been there twice since I was a kid. The ice cream is delicious and the portions are large. The only thing I wish is that they had a coffee shop.
Food,3.0,CG,When I go to Nawlins' (I love the crunchy texture of the doughnut) and the texture is so smooth and delicious. The icing is also light and fluffy. The donuts are soooo good and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I had tried
Food,3.5,CG,Jeff C. Was our cashier and she was rude and just kept complaining. When she got to the front she said we had to leave because we didn't have any money. She was so rude to us and told us we had to leave. We told her we didn
Food,4.5,CG,"Place is awesome. Coolest atmosphere, most people are very friendly. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the beers are good but the atmosphere is so subpar. The place is small and not in a very cool part of town."
Food,4.0,CG,"The ice cream here really doesn't disappoint. It is thick and creamy, and the flavor is just right. The workers are also very helpful and friendly, and the place is very clean.The customer service is excellent. The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the products and the products"
Food,4.5,CG,i entered this coffee shop and asked the barista if I needed help finding a drink. She said she didn't know what I was looking for and the barista said it was fine. She then proceeded to ask if I needed help finding a drink.
Food,4.0,CG,"Don't mind if I do, but it's just too much for me. The fruit and veggies here are top-notch, and they're fresh and tasty. The prices are a bit high, and the quality isn't bad either."
Food,4.0,CG,"This is the only Wawa that has the quality and quality of its product, and the customer service is top notch.  The store is clean and the staff is friendly.  I go to this location almost every day.  I am always pleased with the service and the"
Food,4.0,CG,"I went there to get some ice cream after dinner. I saw a lot of people eating ice cream. There was a lot of people. 

I got the strawberry cheesecake ice cream. It was so good. I would come back for the strawberry cheesecake."
Food,4.5,OR,"So happy to have this place in the neighborhood. Great coffee, great service, lots of socially distanced outdoor tables. Looks cute inside with a piano and lots of nooks that will be great when I go back to being indoors after Covid.  They have breakfast sandwiches, bagels, muffins and donuts. I would highly recommend."
Food,2.0,OR,This has to be the worst BJ's in the world. Selection is terrible. Vegetables go bad in a few days. Then every time you have to stand in line for 30 minutes because the workers just stand around and watch instead of actually opening up a checkout lane. Unbelievable. Walk out of here so angry.
Food,3.0,OR,"Ubër healthy food at moderate prices. 

My gf and I went there thru groupon, the quaint store had a small group of ladies were snacking. The menu is extensive with fruit and superfood choices. This place is definitely for the discerning palate. BTW the detox smoothie was kinda bangin'. Hope to stop by again soon."
Food,4.0,OR,"I want theater day to pick up a few things. There's a sign out saying they were open and I walked in only to be treated like a criminal as if I broke in ! 
I can't remember being treated so rudely and I'm definitely going to have to rethink if I go back again"
Food,2.0,OR,I avoid this Starbucks at all cost. I've given them so many chances and am always disappointed. They don't update their menu on the app and I always prepay for a breakfast sandwich that they're out of. And then they don't say anything like I'm just going to drive away and hopefully forget about it?
Food,1.5,OR,"Found a roach in my strawberries.  Wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.  Makes me want to go back to the VA to get rated for post traumatic strawberry disorder.  

This place is dirty.  Straight up dirty, and cluttered, and unorganized.   Never been to such a lame walmart before."
Food,4.5,OR,"Wow! I got the sweet potato cheesecake and blueberry cheesecake cake, so creamy, so delicious. I suggest calling ahead before visiting on a Saturday because they were pretty much out of everything and they weren't closing for another 3 hours. The staff and owner were super friendly. Yup, this spot is worth all the hype!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Mmmmm this place has a great horchata latte. It was super cinnamon -y and was nicely frothed. The prices are a little high ( I think closer to 5$ for a drink), but not terribly high. It's located within a food Hall, so you can get something to eat with your coffee."
Food,5.0,OR,"Awesome little spot for a glass of wine and appetizers. John and Amy are amazing host/hostess. If you like Rock n Roll, wine, cheese, hummus, and jams, this place is worth a try!  Make new friends or just relax after a busy day at work or after a long flight."
Food,4.5,OR,"Bonesaw is great, the Brews are fantastic. But the best part might be talking to Jordan the bartender, he is knowledgeable about the beers they are putting out, and a true asset to bonesaw. I have been here twice and both times he has impressed would come back just to talk with him about beer."
Food,4.5,OR,Fantastic place!! The atmosphere is cool and hip. The owner is super nice and hard working everyone should support this super cute business in downtown West Chester. I had the snickerdoodle and vanilla ice cream and it was very good. I will definitely be going back and I recommend people bring their entire families here.
Food,4.5,OR,"If you're looking for great coffee/tea for a great cause, this is the place. The ambiance is great for anything from morning meetings to meet-ups with friends to working remotely (there are even rooms for this). The breakfast foods are also great (shout out to the breakfast burrito) and the folks working there are all-stars."
Food,4.5,OR,"All the girls here are so nice !  The owner is so helpful to first time goers. She customized my whole drink based on my preferences. The coffee is amazing doesn't have that generic sweetener taste. Love it , I've been here just a handful of times but this is my new spot."
Food,4.5,OR,"Excellent local coffee shop. Owner operated, very friendly folks. They just opened about six weeks ago right at the beginning of all this craziness. A friend recommended their coffee, as we have very few great quality local coffee shops in Temple Terrace. Coffee is tremendous. Looking forward to coming back to try breakfast and lunch."
Food,2.0,OR,"Hey Walmart, instead of investing in a parking lot security company to run off professional drivers waiting on disabled customers (with way too much unprofessional attitude, but the way), why not designate some spaces for these commercial vehicles up front who are waiting on their disabled passengers? Security should be patrolling looking for real crime..."
Food,4.5,OR,"As it was a Wal-Mart in it's previous life, this place is MASSIVE! Chock full of amazingly fresh/bizarre produce and some of the the cheapest meats and fresh fish in the area. If you're a fan of Asian cuisine and ingredients, this is certainly the place for you! Check it out."
Food,3.0,OR,"IT'S KIND OF LIKE PINKBERRY, except it's called ""Freshberry."" It also kind of looks like Yogurtland.

I am so confused...

And they don't trust you so they put all the yogurt machines behind the counter so you can't sample a gallon of yogurt if you feel like it.

If you ask for vanilla you get chocolate. Just kidding."
Food,3.5,OR,Great quick treat! They have everything a regular ice-cream stand would have. They let you taste all the flavors you want before you pick your treat! Make sure you double check if what you get is ice or ice-cream! The ice and the ice-cream are both very good. They also taste exactly like their flavors.
Food,3.0,CG,this has been one of my favorite breweries in the city.  The owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is great.  I am a huge fan of the IPA's and I love that they have a little bit of everything on tap.  If you are looking for something different
Food,3.5,CG,"Cupcakes were delish,  however, the service was very slow.  We had a small order and we sat down at the counter for a while and then the server offered to take it back to us.  

We ordered a cake for our daughters birthday"

Food,4.5,CG,"Very cool space, dark walls, and an open space to hang out.

Food,4.0,CG,"I really love the space. 

I love the courtyard area. There is a large patio. It's not the best place for a good social spot, but the place is pretty nice. They have a few tables outside which is nice. I love the outdoor area."
Food,4.5,CG,"Rating solely on taste, their ice cream is the best in town. 

The staff is always so friendly and the ice cream is delicious. The staff is always so nice and friendly. 

You can get a large scoop of ice cream if you want to share"

Food,4.5,OR,I really love their apple cider slushes! They're so yummy. The carmel apples are great too. So soft and chewy. I go here every year for some fresh apples and photos! It is an adorable venue and it's been around for so long! They even have pick your own pumpkins! Go go go! Fun for all!
Food,2.5,OR,"I come to this Dunkin when I'm at my friends house the service is typically good. I usually go through the drive thru, the woman gave us part of our order then left and walked outside. We sat there for five minutes before another employee asked us if we were waiting on something. Obviously! So unprofessional."
Food,3.5,OR,Totally chill place to go for lunch. I'm glad I decided to give this place a try. I thought it was a hipsters hangout only. The chicken parmesan was so tasty. I couldn't believe a sandwich big enough to feed two people that tastes that good and only cost $4.75. Plus ice tea for $1 awesome.
Food,4.0,OR,"Love south broadripple and this store in heart of sobro. Great to go food! Fresh chicken breasts here and wings and they are ready to eat , They taste awesome! Pizza made here fresh and again so awesome!!  Light jazz music playing and staff is professional,  very high end and cool."
Food,3.5,OR,I've only been in this DD once before but the manager remembered what I ordered from nearly a month before. Everyone I've met so far is incredibly friendly and respectful. The store is also kept very clean and organized. I may be stopping in more often since I now know they truly care about their customers!
Food,4.5,OR,"I have been spoiled by some amazing donuts in Vancouver so this place was just okay. It was the classic donut base that is decorated with a variety of flavours. My favourite is Cartems donuts back in Vancouver as baseline comparison. However, this place is worth a visit if you are looking for an upgraded classic."
Food,4.0,OR,"Was walking past this place around 9pm and I noticed that the slushy, tea and lemonade containers were still on and full...usually those things are emptied and contents stored in another container and placed in a walk in cooler or something.. But it wasn't..I just hope nobody gets sick if they drink one of those drinks!"
Food,4.5,OR,Quick stop to get in from the cold day. Great cappuccino at just the right temp. Intelligentsia coffee which is a nice treat as I don't find as many cafes carrying it. Lots of seating although was quite busy for a late afternoon and had to wait a minute to get one. Worth the wait though.
Food,2.5,OR,"Stopped by for a quick coffee and snack. A typical DD with Baskin Robins inside. I do love glazed blueberry cake doughnut! Cold brew was average, regular coffee was better. Good for quick stop of in a hurry, not very personal. They have putting green outside but looks like the ball would go in the road."
Food,3.5,OR,This is the spot to hit late-night in New Orleans. It can get a little rough so keep your eyes open. The bloody marys are amazing and so are the chicken nuggets. The pool tables and jukebox are perfectly imperfect. Use the buddy system when you go to the restroom upstairs...that's where the shady stuff happens.
Food,4.5,OR,"Over all rad concept for a coffee shop. I do enjoy the choices in coffee and what not. 

The coffee is always great! Never fails.

I wish there was a few more food choices. 

And I could definitely do without the ""cool guy"" vibe from the curly brown haired guy every time I order a pour coffee."
Food,4.5,OR,"Awesome flavors!  3 different types of coffee ice cream, all of them delicious!!  The cones are a bit expensive, but it's really worth it. There's also a line frequently, but it moves fast. This is a true Santa Barbara classic. The service is usually quite good. All the flavors are unique and quite tasty."
Food,4.0,OR,"This is a really cute place, great atmosphere with an extensive selection of craft beers. Beware the beers are a bit more expensive with small pours. I got a 7 oz pour Belgium saison with looks more like 6 oz for $9. They list the price, but not the pour on the menu. 
Will post pic."
Food,4.5,OR,Stopped here to meet a business partner and hadn't made it here before.  Awesome space with super friendly table service and bartenders.  The beers I tried were hoppy and sweet which wasn't my style as I prefer non sweet beers. No biggie though as their selections are always rotating.  Worth a trip back.
Food,4.5,OR,"This is the best ice cream!!   Amazing combos!   Zanzibar mint was fantastic.   So was ""this @&$! Just got serious"" and peanut butter cookie dough.  Delicious coffee and nitro brew.  Staff is awesome, friendly, and fun!  Super cute in Speedway!  Hope they come to Greenwood/Center Grove soon!"
Food,2.5,OR,I really hate shopping here sometimes. 6-7 people on each checkout line and only three cashiers are open. One just decided to close down. I guess they just don't give a damn. Here once again at 5:30 PM and only two cashiers are open. I'm glad they don't waste my membership money on pesky cashiers.
Food,4.0,CG,"Awesome tasting room, great outdoor seating, and an awesome ambiance. 

The wine is fantastic. If you want to try a few different wines, you'll be a fan! We had a great time and will be back!I absolutely love this place! I love how"
Food,3.5,CG,"Really disappointed visits for the last two weeks. First time I visited and my first time was just yesterday. There was a huge line, but it moved quickly. There was a lot of people waiting for their order. I got a scoop of strawberry shortcake with vanilla ice cream."
Food,5.0,CG,"Can't say enough about this location. The employees are super friendly and helpful, and the store is always clean and well-stocked. There's also a lot of parking, and it's always a great store to get a quick lunch or dinner. I love this place."
Food,3.0,CG,"This store checkout process is always an absolute nightmare. I will never shop there again. The self check out is the worst, and the self check out line is always long. If you need to use the self check out lines, it is very frustrating."
Food,4.5,CG,"What hot summer night would be an easy time to make a cold cappuccino. The employees are all nice, but they're the only ones in the store. The place is small and not open. I would suggest it for a special occasion."
Food,2.5,CG,I had a perfectly adequate time with the bartender and he was a nice guy. I would recommend this place to anyone. The beer is solid and the atmosphere is great. The only downside is that it is hard to get to the bar. There are a couple of tables and a lot
Food,3.0,CG,"Went to the customer service desk to ask questions about a specific item. When I got to the front desk, the employee said the item was in the back and ""we don't carry that item"" and told me that it's in the back. This was obviously a mistake and"
Food,4.5,CG,"The BEST desserts and pastries in town!  We love the chocolate chip cookies, the fruit cupcakes, and the raspberry tart.  We also love the praline filled doughnut!  If you like fresh baked bread, try the coffee one.  This is a great place"
Food,3.0,CG,Who doesn't love Target?! This location has the best produce in the area. There is a decent selection of other items. The store is always clean and the staff is very friendly. I have had to use the restroom several times and it's always clean.
Food,4.0,CG,"I have to agree that this place is a little pricey but it's worth it! I ordered the red velvet cupcake and it was delicious. The frosting was so flavorful and it was just the right amount of frosting. 

I would come back to try their other"
Food,3.0,CG,"The Manager ""Sydney"" made the visit an easy one. He was very kind and the wine was fantastic. The only thing I wish was that they had a wine club in the store that we could get our wine in."
Food,5.0,CG,I've eaten a lot of ice cream and the ice cream is creamy and delicious. I'm not a huge fan of the waffle cones. I think the place is pretty cool with a lot of potential. The staff is friendly and the ice cream is excellent.
Food,4.5,CG,Did you know you can find an amazing bakery?  I saw a lot of people eating the cakes here and we had to get a dozen to share!  There was a lot of icing to make it look so good.   The shop was very clean and the staff was very
Food,5.0,CG,"I am having to work on it, and I just need a cup of coffee. I just can't get over the coffee. The coffee is fantastic, and the service is very friendly. I have had their breakfast sandwiches, which are good. I have had their coffee and lattes"
Food,3.5,CG,"Krispy Kreme is advertising a $2.00 off coupon for a free doughnut. I ordered a half dozen and the box was a half dozen and the box was half dozen. The doughnuts were okay, not great. I would have liked to have some more dough"
Food,3.0,CG,I sent my order to the store and the girl in front of me was very rude and rude. I called the store and the lady said that she would be there when it was ready. She said that she would be there in a minute. I then called to ask if they would
Food,4.5,OR,"Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Absolutely stunning. I love spanish food and eat it frequently and can assure this is high quality, authentic latin cuisine. Ladies are so nice and speak english and spanish and are very attractive not to be inappropriate but i do think that adds to the customer service and experience. Lots of love, thank you"
Food,3.0,OR,"This store has been out of stock for the same item for 4 weeks, we went shopping this week and now the yogurt is out of stock. I also order Foster and Farms turkey breast last week and was told it would be here this week guess what it wasn't!!! This store us a waste of time"
Food,3.5,OR,"The best prices and best quality donair I have had in ages. Quality ingredients, your choice of meat and sauce and ingredients. Awesome selection on top of awesome prices and you cannot go wrong. 10/10 would recommend. Only downside was the lineup at prime time for lunch (1230) however did get in and out within 15 minutes."
Food,4.0,OR,I've just moved to Tucson recently and needed a olace with good coffee. This place has the best cold brew out of all 6 coffee shops that I have visited around town. Staffs are really awesome. Not as many people come here unfortunately which is great for me since I have more space to myself. Highly recommended.
Food,1.5,OR,"A central location in the heart of Trolley Square is the only thing this ACME has going for it. Limited selection, unappealing presentation, and a general rundown atmosphere make this a place to avoid.

A quick run up to 202 offers a much better ACME, in addition to superior grocery options such as Giant, Trader Joe's, and Shop-Rite."
Food,4.0,OR,"I love this location. It's right next door to Target, so it's already fantastic. The shop is always clean and offers a large variety of toppings - both healthy and, ummm, unhealthy. The employees are always helpful and friendly and are extremely personable. I love the original tart fro-yo and Menchie's keeps me coming back for more!"
Food,3.5,OR,"They have so many great deals and in my opinion is the cheapest large name grocery store in town. 
Also, I love how many gluten free options they have !

Another cool feature they have is an eating area with a microwave, so if you're in a rush you can have a quick pit stop for a meal."
Food,3.5,OR,"I meet here often and always have great service. Today, they fell victim to the name misspelling on my cup... I always giggle when my name is spelled Katy because it used to never get spelled that way... it's totally Katy Perry's fault.

My vento skinny vanilla late was delicious and i had balance getting a venti water."
Food,3.5,OR,"Why 3 stars?

I love Target, but here is just something about this location that is not appealing. The store is not the cleanest, not the most well stocked and the majority of the workers do not want to be there. Location is nice and selection as all targets is nice. But sometimes the bad out weighs the good."
Food,4.5,OR,"I am super picky about my coffee which is not ideal

- Their coffee is nice and roasty, no metallic taste at all!
- Owner and staff are super nice
- Shop is in the middle of two streets and there are big garage doors they keep open when it's warm, as well as outdoor seating

So definitely check it out."
Food,3.5,OR,"Haven't been to this location in a few years due to a poor experience. I realize now I've been missing out all that time. The store looks fresh with new decor and new faces. My ice cream - Americone Dream - was fantastic of course, and the servers were fast and friendly. Best ice cream in town!"
Food,4.5,OR,"A splurge well-worth!  Fresh creamery taste with not-too-showy flavors but genuine classic taste of what homemade ice cream is expected to be.  Wish it was around all-year! Only strawberry flavor ice cream I would eat- my least fav flavor of ice cream!  This place has def won me over, a hardcore ice cream enthusiast."
Food,5.0,OR,"This is a chill little bar tucked away behind the Irish Heritage Museum. It is family owned, we were served by the owners' father who was very nice and attentive.

It's a cozy environment where everyone just hangs around getting to know each other. If this type of intimate atmosphere appeals to you, definitely give it a try."
Food,4.5,OR,I decided to come here with my mother and daughter for a sweet treat. This place has an assortment of flavors. I was very impressed and the ice cream flavors were delicious. I definitely would recommend this place to all ice cream lovers. This will become my new ice cream place when I am visiting New Orleans.
Food,4.0,OR,"store needs to be larger to accommodate a city like philadelphia. i know they do the whole one store per city thing, and thats fine, but make the store large enough so people arent crammed in like sardines in a can. 

Get some veggie ground meat stuff too. and make your TJ's brand shit in smaller packages."
Food,4.0,OR,"I love port orleans brewing!! They have a HUGE outdoor seating area and even a rooster and chicken that cluck around sometimes :) the beer is great and Avo taco food collab in there is GREAT! Grab yourself a beer and a taco and enjoy the patio on a lovey Nola afternoon, you won't regret it :)"
Food,2.5,CG,Best DD that I have been to. It is a little far from my house but the staff is so friendly and the donuts are amazing. I think the place is pretty nice and clean. It's a little pricey for a donut but worth it.
Food,4.0,CG,"Very fresh produce, scrumptious Jersey wine, and an impressive selection of craft beers.  I was particularly impressed with the Biergarten, which is located near the beach.  I was looking for a table in the back of the store for a few hours and found it"

Food,3.5,CG,"Beautiful place to spend a weekend. The owner is very knowledgeable about wine and the wines are pretty good. If you want to try a few different wines, you'll be disappointed. I was so excited to see this place open in the same part of town."
Food,4.0,CG,Store only allows 7 people in a single space.  I saw people who were in line and we were so confused.  I asked for a manager to help me.  She said that it was okay.  I walked out.  I told her I was still waiting and she said
Food,4.5,CG,"After savoring every delicate and delicious dessert, the taste is overwhelming. 

The fruit and the other two were the best I've ever had. The flavor was so smooth and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the lovely flavor of the peach. My boyfriend got the strawberry shortcake"
Food,4.0,CG,The only reason why this location has such a low rating is because it's just a few blocks from my house.  The staff is always friendly and the store is clean.  The only thing that is disappointing is that the produce is always fresh.  This is my first time going here

Food,4.0,CG,"It is a cute place, and the coffee is good too. 

The staff is always friendly and the drinks are always delicious.

Food,4.0,CG,"Not like this is my go to place for ice cream.

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The place is clean and inviting.

This place is a great place to get ice cream in the summer.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor"
Food,3.0,CG,So there really is only one size and the ice cream is creamy and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff is always friendly and the ice cream is great.I'm so excited to see this place open in the neighborhood! I love the decor and the vibe! I
Food,4.5,CG,"I have frequented Penns Woods since it opened. Their produce section is excellent and the staff is extremely friendly. The bakery is also very good, if you don't know what to order. Their bakery items are always fresh and delicious."
Food,4.5,CG,"Loved this place. What a nice place and the food was good. Also, the people were friendly.I had the opportunity to visit a few places in the area, and it was pretty nice to have a little local coffee shop in the area. I ordered a pour over and they"
Food,3.0,OR,"If you go to Penn, this liquor store is a Godsend because it's walking distance from campus.  I really like this one because of their vast wine selection and clean decor. It's a decent size and there's a parking lot outside, if you happen to drive there.  Staff is friendly enough and shopping here is easy."
Food,4.5,OR,"There's really not a lot needed for this review. The ice cream and water ice are fantastic. I've yet to find a flavor that wasn't stellar. Two things cost a half star: fee for a credit card and minimal seating outside. 

You can't go wrong here. Try something familiar or grab something exotic you will certainly be happy."
Food,4.5,OR,"One of Ben's favorite breweries. 7venth Sun, Dunedin. The original location and in my opinion...the best, I just like the vibe more. Within walking distance to so many other breweries as well! It is a lot smaller than the Tampa location, but I like that and you can just chill outside on a beautiful day, enjoying a flight."
Food,4.5,OR,"I feel that it is time to update my previous review.  Cigar City continues to make the best beer in Florida, but now they have improved the tasting room experience as well.  So I have upgraded them to 5 stars.

Look for an expansion of the tasting room very soon as well for an even better experience!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Great bubble tea and cute atmosphere, it's always very busy and bustling, and the staff seems slightly stressed but they hurry to get your stuff out quickly. They also have board games you could play while you hang out, my friend and I enjoyed some Jenga here the other day. The taro bubble tea is my favorite here!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I have yet to try their other drinks but so far had the uji matcha (with whipped cream) the other day and the rose milk tea today. They tasted great and I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors! Also the interior is bright, clean, and modern, with a decent amount of seating, charging outlets, and has wifi!"
Food,3.5,OR,"I have been to three different Starbucks in a week.  Why aren't there any pumpkin scones??  I was told that ""they"" misjudged the popularity of them and that they are gone for the season.  The season just started.  Very disappointed.  Not good.  I guess I give on you guys.  Bad decision."
Food,4.5,OR,"It was a fun, informational trip. We were running 3-4 minutes behind for the start of our trip, but called ahead. One of the tour guides stayed back and caught us up to the tour. They accommodated us well with our stroller and little guy. We enjoyed it, but enjoyed the personalized help and attention most of all."
Food,4.5,OR,"While on the Trolley Tour, we noticed an ad for a vodka slushie Lemonade. Sounded good but it was barely noon.

We decided to check it out anyway and found out they offer free samples of the slushies. It was pretty good!

They also sell moonshine and other liquors and I believe they offer tours of the distillery as well."
Food,5.0,OR,"The Gospel Coalition Women's Conference rolled into town, and this shop opened on the weekend just for the ladies in dire need of Jesus and a cup of coffee. Cute little shop to stop by for your morning coffee with Kari Jobe jammin' out on the stereo. Awesome! Great coffee, and amazing spirits. Thanks for the caffeine boost!"
Food,4.5,OR,"IMHO, BEST chocolate shop in the city! Absolutely delicious, and the employees are incredibly friendly and kind! Very very good coffee and espresso (the ""Red Eye"" used to be my jam for quite some time- that'll perk ya up in NO time!) 

Please go to Lores and explore all of their wonderful goodies! You will NOT be disappointed!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I love the space they have which is half cafe, half plant store. They sell a bundle of things, from jewelry, plants, cute office supplies, and other local artisan pieces. I would not say items are cheap, however staff is super friendly. 

The mocha at the cafe is $5, but their coffee is meh, a little burnt tasting."
Food,4.5,OR,Tiny little place with such nice flavors of icecream. Had timberline hop and shiso plum. Like the freshness of peach and plum flavors in the icecreams. Single scoop ~4.75 and double scoop ~7. Waffle cone for extra $1.10. The waffle cone was very fresh and yummy too. Would love to try the sandwich icecreams next time I visit
Food,4.5,OR,"We came here to here for a local concert. What family feel. My only suggestion is they get some new chairs as they are quite unsteady. We enjoyed the inside atmosphere and the fact that you could order at the bar a full meal, to enjoy the music inside. Come and enjoy as it was A fun atmosphere!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Take my money, please!
Love their cookies.
And, they're open 'til midnight.

I had to check them out after driving home one night at almost midnight and this Toyota Tacoma cut across lanes, in front of me, and then did a big ol' left turn into Crumbl. I knew it must be something special.  

Did I say, ""Take my money!"""
Food,3.5,OR,Stopped in for breakfast before work. I got the impossible breakfast sandwich. It was nice and warm but the corners of the bun were hard as if it had been overheated. I didn't get a drink since I was headed to the office where coffee and tea were available. I'd like to see truly vegan options for sandwiches.
Food,5.0,OR,Went here for the first time last night and had an amazing time. My husband and I did a tasting flight of all the tasty Amaros and liqueurs that had to offer and really enjoyed all of them but especially their barrel aged spirits. Can't wait to come back and buy a bottle to add to our drinks!
Food,3.5,CG,"This place is an absolute gem. The owner is super friendly and knowledgeable about the products and the products. If you want to try new products and then have a great experience you should go here. They have everything from fresh cut meats, cheeses, frozen meals, to hot sauce."
Food,4.5,CG,"This little market has a nice selection of local produce and a decent amount of other things.  The prices are competitive with other stores, but they're cheaper than most farmers markets.  The market is well organized and clean.   The produce is always fresh and the staff is friendly. "
Food,4.0,CG,The place to get ice cream. The workers are friendly and will help you find the best flavors.I absolutely love the open concept of this place. The flavor selection is great and the prices are very reasonable. It's a little pricey for ice cream but I always get the same thing. 
Food,4.5,CG,Always amazing service here. This location has the best ice cream I have ever had. I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and the ice cream is great. I'm so excited to have found this place in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe.

Food,4.5,CG,"There is no other for this place, and the prices are a little higher than the local store.I've had the best experience of a Walgreens ever. I was in and out of there within 2 days. The staff was extremely helpful. I was in and out in less than 5"
Food,4.5,CG,"This bakery is top notch. We have been going to this bakery since they opened and the customer service is top notch.  The bakery is always very clean, and the staff is very friendly.  They are always busy and the staff is always willing to help you find something you like. "
Food,4.5,CG,We've gone to Milky Way a number of times and never had a bad experience. I go every time I go. Their ice cream is the best in the city. The flavors are always changing and change. The staff is always friendly. My favorite is the vanilla bean.
Food,4.0,CG,New restaurant and farmers market! We will be back!Very good smoothies! The best! Super healthy smoothies.  The staff is always friendly and the store is clean.  The only downside is parking is difficult.  I would suggest parking on the street.It was a lot of
Food,4.5,CG,Wow! So far my favorite ice cream I've had in a long time! The variety of flavors is so unique and unique! I got a vanilla and the flavor was sooooooo good! I also got the chocolate peanut butter flavor which was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be coming back!
Food,4.5,CG,This is a very tiny location. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever encounter. They are rude and will not help you. They are rude and refuse to help you.
Food,5.0,CG,"Totally worth the drive!!! Beach, Tampa, and the area. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and"
Food,4.5,CG,"No Reading Terminal Market trip, I was hoping to try this place out for a reason.

Food,1.5,CG,"This store is a dumpster, it's an dumpster.

Food,4.5,OR,I stopped by on my way to Zionsville Middle School for a musical to have a quick beer.  I asked the bartender for a light beer and he delivered! The other bartender was sweet as could be and we talked a few times in the short time I was there.  The free popcorn is a nice touch!
Food,4.0,OR,WOW is all I can say. Way better than Crumble cookie. Nutella stuffed chocolate chip. I warmed it up for 30 sec like the box said and I was in heaven. The cookies are HUGE. My husband and myself shared one. My daughter got the Fruity Pebble one and it was amazing as well. Must try will in Tampa
Food,3.5,OR,Hands down the best customer service in the industry right here. My wife and I have been coming to this location  for years and always have an incredible experience with the employees when we come in. Huge shout out to Parker for always being friendly and always making the best drinks! This will always be our coffee spot.
Food,5.0,OR,"I came in, last minute, for a anniversary cake. And although they seem to specialize in light pastries, I did get a cute little chocolate cake with fresh fruit.  It was a sponge cake and so light a fresh! The really nice part was that the clerk gave me some pastries to try later. 
I'll definitely be back."
Food,1.5,OR,"Rude customer service.
Went through drive through to wait 5 mins with no respond when I said hello, they responded with I'm busy sir with an attitude. Could of said sorry one minute sir we are busy. One other person in drive through and only 4 people inside, not so busy my opinion. Thanks for the ride service Jaricelys A."
Food,4.0,OR,"The place looked great, and the drinks certainly looked interesting. Unfortunately I didn't get to taste any of them because, after 15 minutes waiting at the bar, no one had attended to us or even acknowledged our presence. There were maybe three people in front of us, but things were moving so slowly it simply wasn't worth the wait."
Food,2.0,OR,"Not being polite anymore, like most Wal-marts this place is terrible.  They never have the items that I want in stock, long lines and most employees appear to only be there for a paycheck.  However, I will continue to shop there on a limited basis b/c they are cheaper than most grocery stores.  Avoid if possible."
Food,4.0,OR,"Great beer and excellent service.  We were here from out of town, it was a rainy day, so we didn't hang out in the beer garden, but it looked like it would be really nice on a sunny day.  The staff were awesome and gave us good tips about local things to do on a rainy day."
Food,2.5,OR,"Drinks amazing. Most of the employees super amazing and sweet. But don't forget to order anything at the screen, or you'll get attitude from someone who wasn't even running the drive thru, about how to order. Like yeah, I'm the only person in America who doesn't know how to order at Starbucks. I forgot to add on a SCONE."
Food,3.0,OR,"I go to this store quite a bit. The prices are less than the nearest store, Dorignacs, and Rouses, but not cheaper than Trader Joe's. 

One thing I did notice is lack of common courtesy.  Please, thank you, and have a nice day, are non existent. 

The produce is pretty good and they usually have enough registers open."
Food,5.0,OR,Came here for a drink before dinner and really enjoyed our cocktails! It looked to be a co-working space by day that turns into a really cool place to grab a drink later on the day. The atmosphere was great and the hand crafted cocktails were phenomenal! We will definitely be coming back the next time we're in town.
Food,1.5,OR,"This is the worst place to go ever! The associates are shitty, their attitudes are so nasty and they have no manners. If you're reading this please don't come here if you don't want to be aggravated. The store sucks even worse than the associates attitudes. They need to close this location and remodel it and hire new associates!?"
Food,2.5,OR,"Came in the drive through today to order a dragon drink with foam on top. I guess they forgot to turn the mic off because they started laughing at what a ridiculous drink it was and how ""people just order things just to order it"" maybe you should double check if your mic is off next time mrs."
Food,1.5,OR,"I love this store. It's our super center for my Area and it's great. The workers are nice, it's not as messy as walmarts usually are. Its very spacious, and the shelves are always stocked. The bargains are great compared to shoprite sometimes. Only down side is customer service.. The lines are always long and they move very slow."
Food,4.0,CG,Fun little ice cream parlor. We had the mint chocolate chip and it was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff was very friendly and the ice cream was great. I'm so excited to have found this place in Nashville! I wish I had tried it sooner.
Food,5.0,CG,Wow wow wow!  Skip the ice cream and try something new.  This is the best ice cream I've had in a long time.  The staff is always so friendly and helpful.  They are always so nice and welcoming.  I wish I had gotten some of their other flavors but
Food,5.0,CG,"With Uber, it was a little more expensive than the other two. 

The person who waited on me was very nice. The guys behind the bar were very nice. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the beers. I would definitely come back.This is one of my favorite local grocery stores."
Food,2.5,CG,I only go here because it's close by and they don't have that much variety. The employees are nice. The place is clean. The customer service is okay. The place is well kept. The store is a bit small. I wish they had more variety.
Food,4.5,CG,Great place to relax and enjoy a beer with friends. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in at around 3:15 on a Friday night and there was a line up to the door.  It was a little slow for a busy Saturday night.  There was no one behind us
Food,4.5,CG,This is hands down the best ice cream I've ever had. The staff is always so friendly and the ice cream is delicious. The staff is always so nice and accommodating. You can't go wrong with this place. This is my favorite Starbucks in the area.
Food,4.0,CG,"Is love at first sight, it's the best part of the place! The variety of flavors is so so unique and delicious. The ice cream is the best part. The staff is so friendly and helpful. It's a great place to shop for frozen yogurt!It's not that I love a"

Food,4.0,CG,"I am back again to try more flavors.Went here after dinner for a couple of friends. We had the raspberry and banana, both were fantastic! The customer service was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice"
Food,2.5,CG,"I don't know what changed this place, but it is a great place for a variety of cupcakes. The woman at the counter was very friendly, and offered to take my order to go. The cupcakes were moist, but not too sweet."
Food,4.5,CG,"We thoroughly enjoy everything we've had here and the food is good. 

The only thing I wish we had was a place like this closer to where we live. The only other place we have had in the area that I would go to for coffee and food is the one in the mall"
Food,4.5,CG,We stopped in St Louis last weekend and the ice cream was fantastic. The staff was friendly and we had a great time. I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.
Food,2.5,CG,"Friendly staff, for the most part. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the store is a little small. The store itself is small, the shelves are empty, and the shelves are not stocked. It's a shame because they have some great sales on some items."
Food,4.0,CG,"Can be a little obnoxious, but the fact that you can't find anything in the store is annoying. 

If you're looking for some basic essentials, this is the place to go. 

There are a few things that are not available to purchase here, but the people working"
Food,2.5,OR,"This is actually for the Starbucks in this store. They make good drinks, but are extremely slow! If one store can make drinks in minutes of ordering, even when they are busy, all should be able to. The Target store is actually pretty nice. It is clean and organized. The staff could be a bit friendlier. Overall it is alright."
Food,4.0,OR,Really really good! I came here Bc I was nearby and in the area and from the looks of the place I didn't expect too much but when I tried the moose tracks Ice cream it tasted delicious and fresh! I couldn't expect better! I'd put it up on the scale with Ben and jerrys tbh.
Food,2.0,OR,"I was lucky - I came here right at 8 AM when the pharmacy opened and the place was empty - thus no waiting (lines here can be ridiculous.).  Plus I got a bottle of ""SmartWater"" for $1.  Score!

Wish they had more cashiers.  (They also have 4 self check outs that sometimes don;t always work.)

A necessary evil."
Food,3.5,OR,"When I'm hitting the Reno stores, this Target is always a must stop after neighboring Sierra Trading Post.  As a larger Target, it's got more selection in the areas that I need - the $1 bins, toiletries and household goods.   Though I inevitably end up with some groovy not-to-$$ clothing from the Isaac Mizrahi sale rack somehow."
Food,4.5,OR,"A bit pricey, but that was to be expected with a bar in a hotel that's located downtown. The atmosphere was wonderful, especially on such a nice night. Our waitress Christina was rockin, and we couldn't have asked for a better waitress. The only thing I wish this place had was a fried potatoe. Please give me some greasy something!!"
Food,5.0,OR,Stopped by this afternoon. I've been a drinker of Belle Meade Bourbon for a couple of years now. We did the tasting with Allison. This girl knows her stuff. We had an excellent time as we learned the entire story of how Belle Meade came to be. Ms. Louisa would be proud of how she represented the family and brand!
Food,4.0,OR,"The thing I like best about this place is the value for money. Good quality, fresh, well-stocked produce at really reasonable prices. They also have lots of sales on their produce (maybe cause they are still so new) that make their low prices seem even more attractive. Friendly staff and convenient location on Broad Street make this place a win-win."
Food,4.0,OR,"The lines are atrocious. And the store is a little filthy -- but they have so much foot traffic, it's almost excusable. The cashiers are friendly, hip, and seem to enjoy their jobs. They are also attractive, which is nice. I like the prices at Trader Joes a lot in general. They don't totally rip you off like Whole foods."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great atmosphere, clean design, music not blaring. Very spacious compared to Murphy Rd. And outlets at every seat. Fan of the small mugs too (and free refills unlike most charging a dollar); I never finish a normal mug before the coffee gets cold. And plenty far from trendy-town-downtown so there's not a line literally 45 min long any given day."
Food,4.5,OR,I go here pretty often and I am always satisfied. They have the best blended drinks it doesn't turn out watery or half blended it's perfect. They are always so nice. I love that you don't have to pay tax and tips are not excepted. It's a great concept and a great business and I love going here!! Highly recommend
Food,4.5,OR,"Walked in looking for some new wine to try. Was completely ignored by the guy behind the counter who was more interested in being on the phone with his personal phone call. 

Will never come back solely because of the interaction with the douche behind the counter. If management reads this, you should teach your staff how about customer service."
Food,4.5,OR,"Holy cow does this place have high prices!!!!

However-the place is clean-the seafood is fresh
and both times I visited here-I was pleased
with the selections I chose. The crab cakes 
were very good. 

If you are looking for something different other
than the same old salmon,salmon and more salmon
which seems to permeate every supermarket in the
Medford area-this is a good place to go."
Food,2.0,OR,I ordered at the drive through and the service was good & I asked to use the rest room. She warmly said yes that's fine. When I entered I was startled by a rude male employee walking towards me yelling that they're dinning area was closed. I felt like I committed a crime & not that I supported the establishment.
Food,4.0,OR,"Walked in here in the late afternoon, there's not that much people waiting, seats were pretty empty. We ordered the magic bowl which was the soy milk with some tea bag, it's ok too much, not as magic as how the name it's. We also had the iced tres leches, $4.5 for each, the price was not that beautiful though."
Food,3.5,OR,"I had a fabulous time at Crossing. I felt super safe as well. The wines were extremely delicious and worth every penny. The tasting was also very informative! Tom, the owner, stopped by and had a mini conversation with us and it was all very pleasant and welcoming. Perfect day overall. I would definitely recommend this winery to my friends."
Food,4.5,CG,"My family and I have been coming here for a year now.

Food,4.0,CG,"Absolutely love this place! The ice cream is amazing and they have a lot of different options! If you're a fan of the banana, you should check it out!This place is amazing! I came here on a whim and I am so glad I did! The staff was very friendly and helpful."
Food,4.0,CG,"I generally like this Target, but the fact that they are always stocked is a bit odd. The self check out is a bit of a pain, especially if you are shopping in a hurry. They are usually busy, but I've never had an issue with any of the employees."
Food,4.5,CG,I loved getting to see what flavors they had and decided on a flavor that I would like. The owner was super friendly and the staff was very friendly. I got the strawberry cheesecake and it was so good. Definitely will be back for more!This was our first time coming here and we loved it
Food,2.0,CG,"I mean, it's gotten better, more and better, more.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I wish they had some more vegetarian options. The vegan option is limited, and I've had a few vegan options. If you're looking for a vegan option, I"

Food,3.5,CG,Their customer service is absolutely horrible. The only reason I've given this place a 4 star is because the two employees that worked there were both very friendly and helpful. I was in and out of there within 10 minutes. I'm not sure why I would come back to this location.
Food,4.0,CG,"I've been here a couple of times and the food is good. 

The only thing is that it's a little pricey, but that's okay. 

The other thing that keeps me coming back to this place is the parking. I've always found the parking lot is always a"
Food,4.5,CG,"Good selection of asian grocery items. The only problem is that it's close to the airport and we don't have the best selection of Asian foods in the area, so it's not that we'll shop there often. I can't imagine I'll be back."
Food,5.0,CG,I picked up four cupcakes and an apple fritter. The cupcakes were warm and delicious. The apple fritter was also delicious!  The apple fritter was moist and had a great apple flavor. The apple fritter was excellent.
Food,4.5,CG,"The stuff this spot carries is an amazing selection of beer. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The place is a bit small, but the inside is very large and it's well kept. If you're looking for something special, check out the beer garden."
Food,3.5,CG,Love this over the other weekend. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever meet. They are rude and will not help you. They are rude and refuse to help you.
Food,3.5,CG,"This place was like a dream. The owner, Chris, is a lovely person who is passionate about his craft. 

We went to get the Taro milk tea and it was amazing. It's not overly sweet like a lot of bubble tea places. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone"
Food,4.5,CG,"Definitely one of the best ice cream I've had in Nashville. The staff is always so friendly and the ice cream is delicious. The staff is always so nice and accommodating. If you like ice cream, this is a must try. This is my favorite Starbucks in the area."
Food,4.5,CG,"Take out Vodka is delicious and has the best selection in town. 

The staff is always so friendly and the prices are a bit high but the quality of the product is top notch. They have everything from liquor to wine to cigars. If you're looking for something sweet for a party,"
Food,4.5,CG,I really enjoyed this brewery! We had the IPA and the Tres leches. I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was fun. I would definitely go again. It's in a beautiful location and it's definitely worth the trip. Great location.
Food,4.5,CG,Having a flight available or go to the tasting room. I chose a flight of four wines and we sat down at the bar. The bartender took us through the wine making process and made sure we were taken care of in a timely manner. The wine is very good and you can taste the difference.
Food,4.5,OR,"This is one of my favorite Brewery's to stop by, fresh beer great staff and always excited for the next event. Loved the secret Lime Lager and can not wait to try the new Gose on tap. Always a fun place to chill with friends and the food trucks are always different. Bring the bicycle crew through inside and outside seating."
Food,3.0,OR,"I've had a few donuts from them and they've been better quality compared to just regular store quality. Now, I can't say what others have gotten with respect to service, but when I came in I was served by a woman named Laurie I believe who was very nice and helpful the last two times I went in March and April."
Food,5.0,OR,"I went last night and was VERY impressed. I ordered a cheesesteak empanada, a white corn empanada (my favorite), pan de yuca (bread stuffed with cheese), and a soft pretzel. Everything was fresh and delicious. Everyone in the store was friendly and happy to answer any questions that I had. I will definitely be returning to try more of their food!"
Food,3.5,OR,I'm a local first of all. Been in twice in the last week. Poor service both times. Gave you a chance. But 2nd was worse. Both times Saturday afternoon maybe that's it? At the bar. Waited 45 min on beer cheese and pretzel. Bartenders no personality whatsoever. Obviously hate thier job. The 2 stars are for the beers not the service.
Food,3.5,OR,"I called in and ordered bacon, egg, and cheese croissant....... It was a very nice size. The staff was very nice and friendly. My only issue with the sandwich was there wasn't enough cheese on it. If they would step the cheese portion on the sandwich to slice cheese it would be the bomb!!!! The breakfast sandwich  was delicious nevertheless."
Food,5.0,OR,"My favorite wine shop! The owner is always there and is so helpful! He has great suggestions and is very welcoming to those starting out in their wine journey, and those who have experienced palates. Their prices are very competitive to those online, and they give an extra discount when purchasing multiple bottles. They have earned a lifetime customer in me."
Food,4.5,OR,"I would say that the eureka lemon & marionberry flavor is the most unique, and it definitely delivers! I also got the Santa Barbara strawberry (alliteration gets me every time) and it was about what you'd expect. 

Smaller scoops and not my favorite ice cream place (Jeni's and Salt & Straw still win), but all ice cream is good ice cream!"
Food,4.5,OR,"The people here are so friendly and nice! I love donuts  and have been impressed with the quality of these ones, and also that you can get your favorites after 11am! The last two times they've given me a few freebies because they made too many. Their chocolate old-fashioned donut has never disappointed, and their cake donuts are."
Food,4.5,OR,"Stopped by the new Nicey Treat in the Fishers District and really enjoyed it. The kids were happy with their dipped Not So Hot Chocolate pop-cycles, while the wife and I enjoyed the Thai coffee and cookie butter flavors. Nicey Treat is a nice change up for dessert and a quick in and out if you get a good parking spot."
Food,4.5,OR,"Check this place out, tons and tons on tap and all types and stles! The growlers they have are also awesome, a ton of varieties. If you're in the area and look for a cool place that has a ton to offer with stellar prices I would check this abode out. The service was quick, nice, and helpful."
Food,4.0,OR,"My favorite ice cream stop!!! So yummy. These are all homemade! They constantly have great flavors, which makes  it so hard to pick just one. That is why I always have two different flavors. My favorites are the green tea and cotton candy! Lately Iv been getting the peanut butter one too! Live music sucks but I love the atmosphere"
Food,3.0,OR,"On 7/30/17 I bought a medium strawberry squeezer,  which I typically get in the Carson location for cheaper and it's done the right way but anyways it was awful and had the girl remake & when I received the 2nd smoothie there was ice chunks and taste nothing like a strawberry squeezer. Will not return and $7.00 down the trash."
Food,4.5,OR,"I loved these macarons! I was definitely expecting rows and rows of macarons so I was shocked when there were only 6 kinds. I'm not sure if that's the norm or if it was just the time of day tho. Regardless, they were all delightful and they had a special where you got 6 extra macarons when you purchased a dozen."
Food,1.5,OR,"Pharmacy review. This pharmacy incorrectly filled a prescription. 
When I called to complain and get it corrected, the person I spoke to immediately copped an attitude, including telling me that I had called multiple times before and she was tired of explaining this to me. I had never called her before, so apparently this happens alot. Run. Do not go here."
Food,3.5,OR,This place was great!!!! The Go Pack non blended drink made my now wife and I's night the day after our wedding!!!! We had so much fun!!!! Our bartender was the best!!! It was 5/26 at maybe 8pm...we got two Go Pac's one with an extra shot and no citrus vodka and we got the hook up!!! Y'all are the best!!!!
Food,2.5,OR,Probably the worst place to go for Quality products and service from what Iv seen all this place is worried about is money more than their employees I've seen many people being forced to go get shopping carts in the rain by their managers with it lightning here also I will never go to a place that doesn't respect their employees
Food,3.5,OR,"We usually go to Cherry Hill Mr. Wish and love it there but they were closed. Came here and the man was rude and the place smelled like fish. My bubbles were hard and stale, unlike when we go to Cherry Hill store where they are warm, soft and gooey. Wont come back to this location but still love mr."
Food,3.0,CG,Most inexpensive ice cream I've had in the area.  I also love that they have a couple different flavors so you can try different ones before deciding.  I think the place is pretty cool with a small patio.  The staff is very friendly.I come to this Starbucks almost every morning and it's
Food,4.5,CG,My trike (yup adult trike) and an IPA. All three were fantastic. The IPA was strong and refreshing. The Biergarten IPA was also fantastic. The IPA was a little too hoppy for my taste. The IPAs were good. I would come back to try the other
Food,4.5,CG,"For a place that promotes health and wellness, this is the place to go for the best cup of coffee in the world. I am a coffee lover, and this place is definitely a treat. They offer a wide variety of coffees, and even if I don't drink coffee, they have a decent selection"
Food,4.5,CG,"A friendly place to stop and grab a bite to eat.

The cheese board was awesome.

I had the Chicken wings.  The chicken was tasty.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was good.  The fries were tender and chewy.  The wings were a bit too"
Food,3.5,CG,"Cheap, but not tasty. I had a large iced coffee with a nice amount of caramel and the coffee wasn't too sweet. I liked the coffee but the flavor was not great. I'm so excited to have found this place in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe."
Food,3.5,CG,"When a business is trying to expand, the food is good, but the service is slow and the coffee is not very good. The coffee is not the best, but it is pretty good. The staff is not very friendly, which is why I don't get my coffee there. I love the interior and"
Food,4.5,CG,"We love the Boba but this place is the worst. I will never ever go back to this place. If you want to get your boba fix, you're better off going to another place. I'll just be honest, it's one of the worst places to go. The staff is a bit"
Food,4.5,CG,We went on the Beer tour with the bartender and she was a nice guy. She was very informative and very friendly. The tour was informative and fun. We got to try 4 different brews and had a great time. We will definitely be back!I always like to try new things and a new place
Food,2.5,CG,"When I buy food I go to the market and try all the produce that is in the store. I always have the best experience, but I have to say, the produce is not that great. I have been in the produce section for about 15 years and always find the produce not ripe and a bit over"
Food,4.5,CG,The ladies who run the shop are incredibly sweet and friendly. The cheese selection is awesome. I had the Chicken salad. The chicken was tasty. The other items were not as fresh as I would like. The rest of the food was fine.
Food,4.5,CG,"I love having access to this place and the food is good. 

The only thing I wish they had was a bakery, but they're open 24 hours so it's pretty nice to have a little breakfast in the morning.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too"
Food,4.0,CG,"Great bakery for dessert filling.  The cake is moist and delicious.  The staff are always friendly and accommodating.  The bakery is always clean and the shop is always well kept.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend you stop by and see for yourself.  I love the name and"
Food,2.0,CG,"I am a physician.  I have been using them for years.  They have the best service.   I had a doctor call me to get the medicine, and it was sent to my home.  It was a very nice experience.  I will continue to use them for the best care."
Food,3.5,CG,"Rude. Some customers get a little annoyed and the store is too small. There is a large selection of self check out lanes and the rest are self checkout.

This is a store that takes credit cards and is in a very busy area. If you need to purchase alcohol in bulk, they have"
Food,4.5,CG,Cage Brewery is hands down the best brewery in the city.  The owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is top notch.  The food trucks are the best part.  I especially like the food trucks and the beer trucks on the weekends.  This is a great place to have a beer with friends
Food,4.5,OR,"I went here today for my birthday. They told me to go to the window to Order. After 15minutes of standing there with no one else in line and watching 3 girls try to check out one costumer, we left for another local winery. I picked there because of their family oriented environment but I couldn't stand the service. What a shame."
Food,4.5,OR,"Love the location. Love the beer. This is a much needed addition to Chester Springs. Based on the huge number of people turning out each week, there is definitely a need for a beer garden that folks don't have to make a long drive to get to (or
Can even walk to in some cases). I sincerely hope this becomes a permanent thing!"
Food,2.5,OR,I was disappointed with my sub today. The old lady who made this sub for me without a good attitude. She even did not want to make my bread hot instead of pushing me to add the vegie on top. This is not my first time here but I will not come here again. It's the worst sub I have ever had.
Food,4.5,OR,So glad this spot has opened up in the Spring Garden area! The staff are super friendly and helpful and the selection is surprisingly diverse - truly something for everyone. The usual smoothies and juices but also delicious sandwiches (I loveeee the remix) and their Mighty Mylks (homemade cashew milk base) are awesomeeeee. So creamy and delish - I love the Matcha!
Food,5.0,OR,"I so badly want to love this place, with their happy and helpful staff and beautiful selection, but I have now had two plants with bug problems. My Angelina seemed to be harboring a grasshopper nest and my peppermint became infested with aphids. Both plants were inside so I assume the bugs came from the farm. Disappointed and likely won't be returning."
Food,4.0,OR,"The setting's small and there's nowhere inside to sit. You have to go outside for that and even then it's just a few tables.

The orange muscat is very good here. The other stuff is mediocre.

I'm not sure why they chose to locate here, but it's a bit isolated, especially if you rode the train into town like a lot of wine tasters."
Food,4.5,OR,"I don't give too many places five stars but this place is legit. The shaved ice is amazing quality and every order is created with fresh shaved ice. The amount of flavors is unbelievable and there are so many other options on the menu like drinks, smoothies, and ice cream. The white coconut shaved ice with vanilla ice cream is the best!"
Food,3.5,OR,"I went here today with a friend who really wanted Insomnia.  I have to say the service really made up for the last time I was here. Shawn was great in helping us make a selection, he was very friendly and the cookies looked like the great Insomnia cookies I love!! I suppose everything deserves a second chance, especially cookies! !;)"
Food,4.5,OR,This is an awesome brewery. When we we t it was National dog day!! They have tons of games and TVs if any sports team is on. The beer was very good and the had a great selection. The location is very interesting. Easy to get to near 295 exit off of Rt 70. Great place to bring friends or a date!!
Food,3.5,OR,"The customer service provided by the brothers and sisters of this location is unmatched. It's always a memorable experience when Lenny, Kyle and Batman are working. Nothing but laughs, good energy and good drinks. Thank you for going above and beyond for your customers and adding value to their lives. I'm sure I speak for everyone else in saying, we appreciate you!"
Food,3.0,OR,Nice and clean.   They keep changing the products and sometimes I can't find what I need. ( 2% horizon organic milk is no longer there)   the produce is old and lots of it is bad or on verge of bad so be careful when u pick that.   Other than that good typical Sam's and typical service.
Food,2.5,OR,"The ability to get anything right in this location requires a genius. My cup filled with ice after my asked for no ice. My boyfriend got a coffee, it came without creamer. We had to go to the grocery store after sitting in SB line for 30mins. Food missing, drinks with no straw. The service here is just atrocious every single time"
Food,3.0,OR,I have to say I love this store. The selection is great and the shelves were all stocked and ready to go. The prices were amazing compared to some stores. The store was clean and the employees all were very nice. The other shoppers were even nicer here than at other stores. I will definitely be back and will definitely recommend Giant.
Food,3.0,OR,"As others have stated below, this place is extremely overpriced.  They have a great selection of some rare whiskeys...and there is a reason for that.  No one with any intelligence is going to pay some of the prices they are asking.  I made the mistake of going for one bottle of bourbon.  I will not be going back."
Food,4.5,OR,"Visited this newly opened establishment on National Ice Cream Cone Day. The space is conveniently located & has friendly, helpful staff. I tried a few flavors & all were rich. I decided on the staff suggested black cherry ice cream & added strawberry to make a delicious dessert mix. I highly recommend this creamery & I look forward to my next visit."
Food,3.5,CG,Always clean and always welcoming. My go to is the fruit smoothie. The fruit smoothie is a favorite. You will not be disappointed!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.
Food,3.0,CG,"It's Starbucks. They're the same.

I'd say this location is my go to Starbucks. It's so close to my house, and I get the same drink every time I go.

The staff is always very nice, and it's always clean. I always get the same drink every"
Food,4.5,CG,A great neighborhood hidden gem. We will be back!Very good smoothies! The guy working the counter is so nice and the place is clean and inviting. I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.
Food,3.5,CG,"Great fresh bagels, made right, and an amazing bagel. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do, and when I asked her to repeat it she was rude and condesc"
Food,4.5,CG,"I met the owners at the bar and they were very knowledgeable about the history of the distillery. We had the opportunity to try a few of their spirits and bought a bottle of their vodka. They had a great selection of vodka, vodka and some spirit. The owner was very knowledgeable about the history of the dist"
Food,3.5,CG,This is an awesome Fry's location. The employees are friendly and helpful. There is a large selection of items that I don't often see at other Fry's. There are a lot of items that are well stocked and in good condition. The store is always clean and well-stocked.
Food,3.5,CG,"Great and friendly staff, amazing ice cream, and the prices are a little steep for the size of the cup. I had a great experience at this location! The customer service was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the flight of 4 different beers and the bartender was very helpful. The beer was great."
Food,4.5,CG,This place is dangerous! Too many flavors and the ice cream is creamy and delicious. I went with the Strawberry and the Butter Pecan. The butter pecan was so good and it was so good. It's in a very cool strip mall. This place is a great place for people watching.
Food,4.0,CG,"Great place.  Great selection of flavors and the staff is very friendly.  The best part about this place is the unique flavors.  I got the churro and it was delicious.  They had a few flavors to try, but I wish I had tried more.  The only downside is that it"
Food,4.5,CG,"This place is okay. I go here at least once a week. 

The staff is always nice and the drinks are always good. 

I think the place is pretty cool. They have a few TVs outside which is nice. I love the decor and the vibe. I love the vintage chairs"
Food,3.0,CG,The breakfast plates and whole foods. The coffee is good too. The fruit and veggies are always fresh and fresh. The cakes and muffins are always delicious. I go here often and order the breakfast burrito which is always fresh. My boyfriend gets the hot chocolate and the croissant.
Food,4.0,CG,This is one of the better ones I've ever been to. The fruit and veggies are so fresh and delicious. The produce is also fresh and tasty. The staff is always friendly and helpful. It's a great place to shop for all your needs. The staff was very helpful and friendly.
Food,4.5,CG,This was probably the worst time I've ever had in my life. I just got a cup of coffee and it was just the most bitter and bitter coffee I've had. I will definitely go to another Starbucks.The best ice cream ever! I love the flavor combinations and the staff is always so friendly and accommodating
Food,4.5,OR,I would absolutely give this place a 5 star but the fact they don't open until 7am makes it impossible for me to grab a cup of coffee in the morning before work.  Other than that absolutely fantastic coffee.  It is very difficult to find a traditional coffee house in Philly which makes this place a one of a kind place.
Food,4.0,OR,Tried this place last weekend and loved it. Great IPA and food was delicious (brisket). Super cute inside too and we liked the outside waiting area. It did take a long time for the food to come out but I'm expecting that to improve...it's still early days yet. Waiter was attentive and kept us updated. In any case we will definitely be back!
Food,4.5,OR,"Why haven't I been here before?  A truly old fashioned meat market with an excellent selection and price.   They had ground round on sale for 3.69 lb, wow!  And we picked up chicken quarters and T-bone steaks, both at competitive pricing.   The steaks were dinner tonight and were excellent.   They have a customer for life."
Food,4.0,OR,This is a great spot for traditional ice cream and lots of flavor variety! I had to ask the servers to describe the flavors since not much detail was provided. Motor oil for example is a chocolate flavor with green ice cream or something crazy like that. I had the butter brickle and loved it. Think butter pecan but creamy with toffee bits.
Food,3.0,OR,"The nasty rude people teenager working the drive thru needs a new job or none at all. She actually argued with me about what I ordered. I order the same drink every time for years. She thinks she knows what I want, more than I do.  She actually argued about what ""I "" REALLY wanted! Hahahaha, yes, Im serious, this really happened."
Food,4.0,OR,"The donuts, awesome. Something for everyone.

The shop, boo. I was there with a friend (we were there for the first time) and we were expecting to sit and catch up. But there's no tables. We had to go sit in a car and eat donuts.

Employees are great- very friendly and patient while you try to select six donuts from all the amazing options."
Food,2.5,OR,"I did the self check out in Spanish and an employee came over and changed the language to English. I complained and asked the manager what kind of culture she was trying to create in her store and she told me, ""American. This is America and we speak English."" Kroger's employees are intolerant and closed minded. I don't need discrimination with my groceries."
Food,4.5,OR,"Very friendly staff! It's a nice cupcake bar in the center of the central west end. We went after sushi at subzero and was not disappointed!

I've ordered cupcakes on the go from them for varies events and they always have great classic flavors as well as some seasonal flavors as well. It's always a delightful experience when I have cupcakes from The Cup!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Such a great selection! Scott, man in charge, was very helpful and had excellent suggestions considering your personal likings. He helped us create our own flight and we got more than enough beer for our money. And naturally the beers were awesome. Best hidden gem in New Orleans! We were only here for 24 hours and this was by far my favorite stop."
Food,2.5,OR,"There isn't another lunch meal in Mid-City that is more affordable. That may be a double-edged sword however. You can get a Meat and vegetable/side with rice, can drink, and two slices of white bread for $4.35, which includes tax. That being said, the food tastes well. It is not the cleanest of places but you get what you pay for right? Right."
Food,3.5,OR,"Man at the cash register was very rude. He was very short with his words, rolled his eyes at us, and and when I asked questions he would not give us an answer. I was going to buy more cookies but I was so uncomfortable that I left the store as soon as I could. Very unfriendly staff. Go to a different place"
Food,4.0,OR,"A medium sundae is supposed to have 2 scoops of ice cream in it, and mine had a frothy, soupy lukewarm pool of what might have been 1 scoop of ice cream at some point. This place isn't cheap, and if you'd like good quality ice cream - go across the street to 7-11 and get packaged ice cream at half the price."
Food,4.0,OR,"We had been wanting to get here and try the beer, really glad we made the trip. If you like IPA's, you have to try the Sugar Coated Pony Kisses. The service was a little slow, but the food and beer were very good. If you're looking for really good pub grub and fresh, great tasting beer, add this place to your list."
Food,2.5,CG,The employees chastising me about this. The fact that they act like they hate customers is a horrible thing. If you want to get your money back then the manager needs to take care of that. They need to learn how to be a good manager.This was our first time visiting Santa Barbara and we were so excited
Food,3.0,CG,"2 great visit experiences during this pandemic. Thanks again for being a local business. I absolutely love the coffee here, but the people that work there are always very rude. I have had their breakfast sandwiches and I am always disappointed. This morning I ordered the breakfast sandwich with cream cheese."
Food,3.5,CG,"The worst Walgreens i have ever been to.  Pharmacy is horrible, slow, and rude.  If you want to get your medicine and then have a customer wait a long time for it, this is the place to go.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too"
Food,4.0,CG,"Mediocre ice cream, no strawberries, no chocolate chips, no chocolate chips. All of the flavors were just average. The woman at the counter was also very rude and didn't seem to care that we were there. It was a little awkward for a customer to come to the window and not know if we were"
Food,3.5,CG,"I hate to leave a review but I am very disappointed.

The staff is rude and the coffee is not very good. The girl that works the counter was so rude and made me feel uncomfortable. 

The only reason for 2 stars is because the coffee was good. I had a drip coffee with soy"
Food,5.0,CG,"Check out this new Barbera & Tchoupitoulas location!This is a pretty good coffee shop.  The staff is friendly and the coffee is tasty.  I've been to many coffee shops in the area and this one is one of them.  If you have a craving for a sweet coffee,"
Food,3.5,CG,"I ordered cupcakes for my daughter's birthday. We decided to split a cupcake for our daughter. We ordered the raspberry and the red velvet. The lemon was moist and flavorful. The red velvet was a little too sweet for me, but it was light and rich. The red velvet was light and fluffy."
Food,4.5,CG,"It's a zombie-themed coffee shop, and the coffee is good.

The staff is friendly and the coffee is delicious. The people behind the counter are the nicest people you'll ever meet. They are friendly and will even help you find what you need. 

I have also had a couple"
Food,3.5,CG,"This is my neighborhood CVS, and it's the only one I will go to. I go there every other day.  The staff is always friendly and the store is clean. I go to this location almost every day.  I am always greeted by the staff.  There is always something new to try."
Food,4.0,CG,"I'm sorry...I wished so bad that I could give 0 stars but it's my go to grocery store.

I had a coupon for a free mini salad and a half a dozen other items. They had everything I needed. I was able to find everything I needed. I also picked up some a few"
Food,4.5,CG,"Anyone giving Strachen's anything other than an ""cute"" look. The wine selection is a bit limited, but I am a huge fan of the ""good"" wines. The wines are well-priced, and I am always happy to find something new to try."
Food,4.0,CG,"My wife and her parents are visiting the area and decided to stop by for a drink. We ordered a 6 pack of the Cherry, Strawberry and Chocolate, and the Cherry. The Cherry was amazing and had a great flavor. We will definitely be back! I highly recommend the Strawberry!This is a very clean store."
Food,3.5,CG,"The Fishers Target is nice! 

The store is clean and organized, and the staff is always friendly. The parking lot is a bit small, but if you're a local, this is a great store. 

I do recommend this Target location to anyone.Great location!  Staff is friendly"
Food,5.0,CG,"Some of the best water ice I've ever had. I also love that they have a couple different flavors so you can try different ones before you get the flavor you're craving.I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but I was excited to try this place. I had the Banana foster, which was a really"
Food,4.5,CG,"For avid gamers and nostalgia enthusiasts, I thought this place was a nice place to hang out and grab a cup of coffee and some beers. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cool place to hang out."
Food,4.5,CG,"plenty of seating both in and out, with lots of seating. 

The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. 

You can get a free muffin and some chocolate chip muffin. The staff also always seems to be very"
Food,3.5,OR,"Great little coffee shop in a great open air shopping spot! 

The Baristas are smart and know their stuff and make a top notch flat white. The vibe is chill and the assortment of French products to gawk over is plentiful! 

If you're not from the area and need a caffeine kick, skip Starbucks around the corner and come here for a delightful treat!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Wow, finally a SOHO bar with a view better than the Edge. If standing in the middle of the deck rail, you see downtown to the right and Raymond J stadium straight ahead, then sunset to the left. Sangrias are under $10. If you check in you get free hummus tapas. We already had dinner so we are saving it for the next time."
Food,4.0,OR,"Sorry, but yet again I feel the need to complain about the intended audience for a Farmers Market, as the Rittenhouse FM (quite clearly, and not surprisingly) is catering toward a crowd with more money than sense.

Certainly there are high quality vendors here, but there are also way too many ""top-end"" vendors whose prices are just way too high.

Clark Park, people.  Clark Park."
Food,3.0,OR,"Rude staff, not so pleasant atmosphere for that reason. Tables and chairs are still not set up to sit down even though most businesses went back to normal after 2020. And again, rude staff. I asked about their new signature ice cream creation and she just pointed to the poster with an eye roll. Not coming back until they hire people with no attitude."
Food,3.5,OR,"The salads are great!  I usually get the chicken caesar but there are a few others also.  There is a beautiful display of all foods including awesome desserts, baked goods, specialty foods, and specialty sodas.  The candy bar is Willy Wonka magnificent.  I like the sandwiches also, but I think the prices of the sandwiches could be lowered a little."
Food,4.0,OR,"First time here and I was impressed! I ordered a gelati and my boyfriend ordered a root beer float. The gelati they use ""yum yum"" which is their version of water ice. The only difference is that it has dairy in it and is creamier. The root beer was tasty, but could use a little more ice cream. All in all it was good!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Totally random. But totally a lot of different teas.

To be honest, I'm usually here when I'm waiting in line for Honey's, but it's a really nice place to sit, have a cup of tea, and just soak in the unique homey atmosphere here. It's a really small place, and I wouldn't have really noticed it walking by, but it has a lot of charm."
Food,4.5,OR,"Grab your your tobacco pipe, grab your vape pen, grab your fadora. See you at arcane aleworks if youre looking for a crowd of individuals who will let you know where the best Pokemon go spots are. Sad to say I was disappointed by the artisan beer selection as it was target for people who drink reclaimed water. Would steer clear."
Food,4.5,OR,Such an awesome winery! The staff was very friendly and made you feel at home during the entire wine tasting.  And the wine was so delicious! I loved the atmosphere and the purpose of the winery. Really enjoyed getting to hear all about the different wines while I was there and how they were made! I would recommend this place to anyone! :)
Food,4.5,OR,"I've been in New Orleans three times recently  and each of the last three times I've been to bacchanal. This place offers wine, charcuterie and cheese with live jazz music. It's in an industrial area in the ninth Ward but it's has a wonderful outdoor area to sit at tables and listen to live jazz. Highly recommend if you go to New Orleans."
Food,4.5,OR,Jeni's has super interesting flavors that are always changing. Tonight we tried candied ginger and churro ice creams - definitely unique. They also have all the classics but done very well. The chocolate is amazing and so is the mint chip. The staff is also incredible and let's you try everything. It's super clean AND they have cucumber water - what's not to like?
Food,2.5,OR,I hate to even give this Walgreens a one star! Definitely pick another location. The cashiers refuse to ring up sale items and I recently witnessed another customer being assaulted verbally in the store by a young male employee when he confronted the cashier about being over charged! I was with my small child and we were both scared by this employees actions.
Food,4.5,OR,"If you're a huge fan of cider and mead, you will love this place. I had the sampler and loved each one especially the Johnny Chapman Cider. The artwork they had on display for this month gave this place a great vibe. I also got a chance to meet the owners and they are truly passionate about their business. Definitely will be back soon."
Food,4.0,OR,"This is a great place to try different beers and spirits. They always have a special for different spirits that are either trying to promote themselves or that was overstocked. The taste of these deals can be hit or miss. This location has a great price on most items and the widest selection of beer, wine, and spirits that I have seen in Nashville."
Food,4.5,OR,"For being a brand new location, this was fantastic! The baristas are so friendly and knowledgeable in the menu, that you wouldn't believe they just opened here. 

The also have a DIY pour-over coffee bar which is really cool to me. 

I got the Blue Suede Macchiato and it's SO freaking delicious. Great addition to the Nations. Most definitely my new favorite coffee shop."
Food,4.0,OR,"Having missing Hey Tea etc from China, this is probably the closest thing we can get as replacement in Tampa. I've had several drinks from there and they are all pretty awesome, the pastry thing was also pretty good. Will def keep going back. The store is clean and makes me feel comfortable staying and chatting with my friend while enjoying my drink there."
Food,4.5,CG,Really good selection of craft beers. The only downside is that it's close to the park and we had to wait a few minutes for our order to be filled.This place is amazing! I came here on a whim and I am so glad I did! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The place was clean and
Food,4.0,CG,"I had the cold brew and it was good, but I will not be going back. 

I am very disappointed. The ice cream is okay, but the service is horrible. I have had better service in the past.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me"
Food,5.0,CG,"One thing for sure that hasn't been said about this place is that they have a decent selection of beer. I had the Cherry Apple Ale and the Hazy IPA. The latter was a little bit too hoppy for me, but it was well balanced with the Hazy IPA. I love a good sour beer, and"
Food,2.5,CG,"Horrible they got hair in the meat department. Not sure if they need to fix this issue. I had the opportunity to visit a few places in the area, and it was pretty nice to have a little local coffee shop in the area. I ordered a pour over coffee and a chai tea."
Food,4.5,CG,This place was so friendly and helpful and the ice cream was delicious. Definitely a must go if you're in the area!I am a huge fan of Treme Donuts. This place is a great little place in the heart of downtown. I love how they have such a wide selection of donuts and treats.
Food,4.0,CG,"By far the best donuts I have had in the city. My husband and I have been coming here since we moved to the area, and they have the best donuts in the city. If you like donuts, this is a must. If you like donuts, you should definitely go to Krispy Kreme"
Food,5.0,CG,"The office space is open, and has a wide variety of seating. 

The staff is always friendly and helpful. The bakery is always fresh and the sandwiches are delicious. I love that they have a little breakfast burrito next door.This place is very good! I had the Banana foster and it was very good"
Food,3.5,CG,This is not a place that has the best ice cream I have ever had. I have been to other locations in the area but this one is by far the best. The ice cream is amazing and the staff is super friendly. I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice.
Food,4.5,CG,"I've got nothing but love for this place. It's a little on the pricier side, but worth it. 

I've also tried the Taro milk tea, which is pretty good. It's not too sweet, and it's not too sweet. I also have tried the matcha milk tea,"
Food,4.5,CG,"If you haven't been here, go to the tasting room. It's a lovely little spot to just grab a bottle of wine and enjoy your wine. The staff is friendly and the wine is delicious. They have a great selection of wines, they also have a variety of wines. The staff is always extremely helpful and knowledgeable"
Food,4.5,CG,"This place is a gem! We have been going here for years now and always have a great experience. We always have the best time, and they have the best customer service. I go here often and it's always a good experience.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique,"
Food,3.0,CG,usually just stop in for a sweet treat.We love this place. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. The beers are always great. The food is always tasty. The only downside is that it is hard to get a seat at the bar.This is our favorite brewery in Santa Barbara. They have a nice variety of
Food,4.5,CG,"Drive over to Santa Barbara and have the best ice cream I have ever had. I have never had a better ice cream than this. I also get the Taro Milk shake and it is amazing. I can't wait to try more flavors. If you are looking for something sweet for a party, this is the place to"
Food,4.0,CG,"Great market in the Quarter. The market has a good selection of items, including local and imported. The produce is always fresh and the meat section is always nice. The store is always well stocked and clean. The store is always well stocked. The staff is always friendly."
Food,3.0,CG,You can't really be give a better rating.Went here after dinner for a couple of hours. It's not the best place for ice cream but the ice cream was great. The line was long and it was a good size. The shop is small and is kinda small but not crowded. They have a nice variety
Food,4.5,OR,"Yummy ice cream.  there's a reason why there a long line out the door after dinner time.  combination of unique and regular ice cream flavors so everyone can be happy.  

they also have premade flavor/sundae combinations and cookies as well. 

delicious. a must stop when in the area.  check out the one closer to middle state street, they have more flavors."
Food,1.5,OR,"It doesn't make sense to me that this Walmart doesn't do returns/exchanges after 10pm. Furthermore, 3 different employees told me that only a manager could complete an exchange at that time and there wasn't one in the store at that time. Most of the employees were at least nice but others were seen on their phones or seemed as if they hadn't bathed in weeks."
Food,4.0,OR,"We live in New York City but my fiancé is from here and she says that if you live here, then Cherry's is where it is at. I have never heard of Water Ice before and I was not disappointed. It was money. I loved it and will definitely be back. I also learned the term, ""jimmies"". Got a great experience with a learning lesson."
Food,4.5,OR,"People, this is the best ice cream in SB!  What I love is that it's a local's place not a tourist trap like Cold Stone.

They blow Cold Stone away, I dont even understand why people like Cold Stone's chewey, weird ice cream... BUT this is not a review of CS, this is all about how great McConnel's ice cream is!

They also have frozen yogurt."
Food,4.5,OR,"Nice crisply clean modern place, but yeah its pretty sterile actually. Gorgeous display of gelato and amazing flavor choices. However -- its all about sugar rush -- not about authenticity or healthfulness, though it claims both. The ""sugar-free"" was LOADED with sugar or sweetener of some kind. It was VERY sweet. If you are going to boast of nutritional value, then POST the ingredient list."
Food,4.0,OR,"Had a popcorn craving after having my mind blown by Garretts in Chicago, but I was sorely disappointed here.
I just got buttered popcorn, which was just okay. Better than microwave, but not the best. Also, a little stale and a little burnt. $3 for a small bag :-/
Service was lackluster. The floors were filthy in the back though they were cleaning that up.
Overall, just ehh."
Food,3.0,OR,"The people really weren't that nice. I would recommend going here though because i have had better experiences. But today, the lady made my father and I's drink horrible. It taste like water and has no flavor what so ever. And for the price we pay i would expect way better, especially since it's happy hour today and it's a more popular day to go."
Food,5.0,OR,"Ordered vanilla chocolate chip with vanilla icing.  It is a beautifully made cake, easy covid friendly pick up and it was easy to place an order.  The staff was very responsive via email.  Beautiful picture worthy cake.  The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because it is very much a dense cake, I prefer a lighter airy cake."
Food,4.0,OR,"Even without the awesome wine deals, Trader Joe's in PA is a decent place to pick up good snacks (Flax Seed Tortilla and Green Bean Crisps yum!) and lots of different nuts & dried fruits.

Also, frozen foods are great...a good place to go for prepared desserts that are frozen and ready for the surprise dinner guest.

Parking is behind store and the store is always busy."
Food,5.0,OR,"A wonderful team of owners. Chris and Christina are incredibly reliable, friendly and consistent. Whether it's their delivery service, billing, or adapting to order changes and needs, they have never let us down. We've been customers for a few years now and we are just as satisfied and thankful for this company and it's services as in the very beginning."
Food,4.0,OR,"Extremely classy wine bar. Cute little outdoor courtyard. Delicious Kir Royale and  charcuterie, cheese, and fruit tray. 

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was I felt like the charcuterie, cheese, and fruit tray was not freshly made. If it had been, that would have given 5 stars.

Everything on the plate was delicious especially one cheese which had grains of mustard in it."
Food,4.0,OR,"The basic donuts are fantastic, but it's for the fancy ones that people wake up at 6:00am and head over to Canal Street. My particular favorite: cake with chocolate frosting and coconut. My friends rave about the maple bacon bar, but everything I've tried has been delicious and the price is very reasonable. Go early--they run out of flavors over the course of the day."
Food,4.5,OR,"What good times. They have some. ""interesting"" flavors. They trick you into believing otherwise disgusting flavors taste awesome. Really, you would be surprised at how good things taste. Order the Tchoupitoulas Challenge for $18 and if you finish it you get your name on the wall, next to some old lady's. Rumor has is one of the toppings is a frozen cow."
Food,3.5,OR,"The food here is always fresh! The people are real friendly. Ask for Khoa; he will take good care of you! I love their fried seafood. Their batter is crispy, light and well seasoned. I just had an amazing fried shrimp po-boy just now. So good!!! My boyfriend just had a roast beef and he was raving about it as he gulped it down."
Food,4.5,OR,"I really like banana pudding and am very picky. I don't believe that I have ever had banana pudding better than this. We were visiting from out of town and just lucked into finding this vendor. If you like banana pudding, don't pass up the opportunity to stop by.  BTW, we had the classic vanilla flavor and sampled the chocolate-vanilla mixture; both were great."
Food,4.0,CG,"This is our go to spot for the wide variety of flavors and toppings. I have yet to find a flavor that I don't like. The staff is always so nice and helpful. I have had their blueberry cheesecake, blueberry cheesecake and red velvet. The staff is always very friendly and very helpful."
Food,5.0,CG,"Been meaning to try the ice cream, and we decided to try it! The ice cream is creamy and so delicious. The staff was super friendly and the shop was clean. I would definitely go again. The flavor was very good. My husband got the chocolate peanut butter with chocolate chips."
Food,4.5,CG,Have you ever dreamed about this place?  It is a great place for a variety of flavors. There are a few different ones that are different than you think you would get at a regular ice cream shop. The staff is extremely friendly. I always get the sampler with two scoops.
Food,2.5,CG,"Considering what it could be, it's the only one in Nashville that I can walk to. 

The employees are all nice, helpful and friendly, and the store is clean and well kept.

Food,4.0,CG,"The beignets here are world class. The beignets are also very delicious. I would recommend the beignets to anyone. The beignets are light, fluffy, and gooey. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. If you're looking for a good beignet experience, this is your"
Food,4.5,CG,Friday at 3:45 and I was told by the girl in front of me that there was no one in front of me. The girl behind me told me that there was no one in front of me. So I waited in line for a while. I then called to ask if they had the cold brew.
Food,4.0,CG,"I so wish I lived closer to the market, but I will be going to the market every time I go.  The people there are so friendly, and the produce is always fresh.  They have everything from fresh cut veggies, beans, jams, candy, to flowers.  I love the name and the variety of items"
Food,4.5,CG,"I love Cigar City Brewing's beers. The space is very small but they have a small upstairs and downstairs patio area.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  There are a lot of selections to choose from and the prices are very reasonable.  If you're looking for a good beer with a good selection, this is"
Food,4.5,CG,"I love this place! As a grown up, we love this place. There is a large selection of beer and wine. The staff is always friendly and the store is clean. I go here often and it's always clean. I would recommend it. This was our first time coming here and we loved it."
Food,3.0,CG,"My favorite Starbucks. Friendly baristas. Staff is always pleasant and friendly. My only complaint is that they don't have the best selection of drinks and food, but if you are looking for a place to get some work done, I would suggest coming here. This is my go to for the best drinks."
Food,4.0,CG,I love love love it here. The coffee is amazing and the people who work there are awesome. I've had the best donuts at the grocery store ever. I was in and out with a smile and the store is so cute. I wish I had gotten some. The staff is always so friendly and helpful.
Food,3.5,CG,I would've given this place a 4 star rating if it wasn't for the slow service.  The other two employees had a bad attitude.  The other two were nice and were polite but it was a little awkward to be in a coffee shop.  I don't know how many people were working there but I was the
Food,3.5,CG,"Food and atmosphere was great, especially the free popcorn!  I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday. The lady behind the counter was very rude. She had no idea what to do. I asked if she could help me and she said no."
Food,4.0,CG,Stopped in today and got a vanilla latte and a vanilla latte. The vanilla latte was a little too sweet for my liking. The vanilla latte was a little too sweet for my liking. It was a good size for the price. I liked the atmosphere. The staff was friendly. The place was clean and
Food,4.0,CG,"Coffee is great but it's a little pricey.  I will say that the barista was very nice and the drinks were great.  

I think this place is a great place to get some work done.  

I would come back to this location again.  They have a nice outdoor"
Food,1.5,CG,"Hit or miss service.  Not sure if the food is good, but they have a decent selection.  If you want to get your food delivered, the sandwiches are pretty good.  The only thing I wish they had was a little bit more variety.  The food was good, but not a lot of variety. "
Food,4.0,OR,"This place is very interesting. Being a business owner though it's pretty much a must in terms of their prices. The problem with this place is they are always stocking, even during the day, and it gets quite annoying. All though the prices are good, it's hit or miss. Some things are cheaper in other places and some things are way more expensive in other places."
Food,4.5,OR,"My husband surprised me with Mother's Day bundts from this place. I'd never been here and neither had he, but we really liked the cakes. He ordered me a red velvet, lemon, and chocolate chocolate-chip arrangement(? it was a little tower wrapped in cellophane). All of them were so good! 

We'll probably be back at some point, but they're pricey and we live kind of far."
Food,4.5,OR,"One of the best Starbucks around. The baristas are always super friendly, every drink I've ever gotten has tasted great, and most importantly of all, this store really sorta feels like a home. All of the regulars are nice for the most part, and the baristas genuinely try to get to know everyone and treat everybody like they're a regular. They consistently go above and beyond."
Food,3.5,OR,"Good place to get your fro yo fix, lots of flavors ranging from original tart to pumpkin pie. The sweeter flavors can be hits (cookies n cream) or misses (red velvet cake), so I would recommend doing a taster, although you are only allotted two so choose wisely! You can accidentally get a $6 frozen yogurt so go lightly on the heavy cheesecake or brownie toppings."
Food,3.0,OR,"Been waiting for a chance to try this food truck and now that I have the jamaican pineapple chicken tacos are to die for they where alot bigger than I initially expected surprisingly sweet with a nice aroma on a nice flatbread corn tortilla shell, had to come back 5 min later just to order it for my wife and kids 5/5 would eat here again"
Food,4.5,OR,"I was here in a snowy winter evening. It's small inside and I've passed since to see they offer outdoor seating. The beer is good and they had plenty of games for us to enjoy while sitting and NHL on. 

Food that evening was barbecue which went perfect with the beer. I'm looking to go back now to catch the pizza truck that comes in Thursday's!"
Food,2.0,OR,Like any Dunkin Donuts they have good days and not so good days. The good far out number the not so good. I stop here often during my morning walk to get some coffee and enjoy a break in the AC. I also utilize the drive through a few times a month.  The few times my order was incorrect the happily and quickly corrected it.
Food,2.0,OR,"This is the closest grocery store in general to my house. I really don't like it. I actually only go here when I need something small, quick. It's dirty and the set up is really difficult to find anything in here. Their produce isn't as good as any of the other locations. I don't think they have a good health food section either, it's really dismal."
Food,4.0,OR,"Delicious premium ice cream. Those who are looking to watch their figure need not stop here. 

They generously scoop their ice cream here. And they have a rich array of flavors from the classics such as strawberry and vanilla to more modern ones such as green tea. I ordered pistachio, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Very rich and decadent - the way I like my ice cream."
Food,3.5,OR,"One thing I know about Starbucks in this location is that there a lot of mistakes with order. 
I ordered Iced green tea latte but instead they gave me a hot green tea latte.
Last time I ordered tall iced white chocolate mocha but instead they gave me a different size, which is grande. 
Great place to study, but I don't recommend ordering coffee at this place."
Food,4.5,OR,"I was introduced to this place by a tea-fanatic friend and I was thoroughly impressed. I love the atmosphere here: dark wood, soothing music and overall very serene. Besides the wide variety of authentic teas, I really have to mention how delectable the tea snacks are. I've tried the something-daifuku (the green mochi,) chofu, matcha cookies and seasonal matcha ice cream and they were all excellent."
Food,5.0,OR,"Popped in the store one afternoon after working outside...it was just the treat for a hot day.  I'm a big big fan of the not so hot chocolate....it's what a fudgecicle wants to be, but isn't.

Now with this store, I can get my fix regularly, or when I can't get to the Wednesday's farmers market downtown.

Nicey treat...thanks for being an awesome addition to our city!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Unfortunately the short, bearded bartender with glasses and chest tat was extremely rude when ordering. Especially towards women. I witnessed two women storm out of the bar because of his derogatory remarks. I'd hate if this guy is a manager of the bar because I personally am a big fan of the homestyle IPA. I will not be visiting any time soon because of this experience."
Food,4.5,OR,I enjoyed my two beers and loved all the options from which to choose. I was disappointed that there were no flights though so I could try more. I went on a Saturday about mid-day in January and really enjoyed my spot in the sun as much of the outdoor patio was in shade. The tables were well spaced the staff helpful and the bathrooms clean.
Food,4.0,OR,"I LOVE this location. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and my mobile order is always ready to go when I get there - doesn't matter if there's one customer or 30. When I take my order they always acknowledge me with a ""thank you, have a good day"" and a smile (which pretty much no other location does). It's a pleasure to go to Starbucks Flourtown!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Stopped here for date night last night- the line was out the door and around the corner, but it is SO worth sticking around for the shakes! We both got The Chocolatier and loved it. Rich, tasty, definitely worth the $8! The selection was massive, it will be hard for anyone to find something they DON'T like. 10/10 would recommend, I know I'll be back soon!"
Food,3.5,CG,"Absolutely love Philly Flavors. This is a great place to try out new things! The variety of flavors is so unique and unique! I am a huge fan of the Maple Bacon, Strawberry, and the Honey Lavender. Definitely a must visit for anyone visiting Philly!I've been coming here since I was a kid."
Food,5.0,CG,"We walked into the store and asked the employee if they had a special for a special order and he said yes.  The employee then handed me the order and said ""no"".  The employee then handed me the order and said ""no"" and then proceeded to give me the receipt with no response.  I was the only customer"
Food,5.0,CG,My favorite. Period. I love that they have an upstairs bar for a nice amount of seating. The only thing I don't like about this place is the fact that it's so close to my house. It's a perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine. Great location. Staff is friendly.
Food,4.0,CG,"Be really careful here; you are not going to feel comfortable walking in and smelling like you are just sitting in a living room. I am not saying that the atmosphere is a great place to hang out, but it is a good place to do some work. This is a great place for people to hang out and have a beer."
Food,3.0,CG,"Very disappointed in the lack of flavors and the long wait time. 

The fruit toppings were so small that it's hard to understand how the flavor is created. I wanted to try the blueberry and strawberry. I was disappointed. I would not recommend this place.I love this place. I have been going here for"
Food,4.5,CG,"Lovely place, hardly recommended.
The neighborhood is a little hidden, but I saw people who were in the neighborhood.
The music is pretty good, but the people that work there are great.
The place is small, and not very large, but plenty of seating and friendly staff.
The only downside is that it"
Food,4.5,CG,"Visited the other night and had an amazing time! The wine was great, the people were awesome and the food was very delicious. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The wine was great, and the ambiance was lovely.I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was greeted immediately upon"
Food,4.0,CG,"Arguably a unique dessert experience. We had the almond butter and the chocolate chip cookies. I was not impressed. The cupcakes were moist, but the icing was not the best. I would have liked to add a few more toppings, but it was too sweet for my taste. The texture of the cake was a bit"
Food,4.0,CG,"The employees here are extremely nice and the drinks are amazing. My husband and I got the strawberry shortcake and it was delicious. The cakes are also beautiful and moist. The only downside is that it is hard to get to during busy times. If you are looking for a good cupcake and a treat to go, I highly recommend"
Food,4.5,CG,Absolutely adore this bakery and especially the bakery. We love that they have gluten free pastries and cupcakes! I am a huge fan of the chocolate chip cupcake and the chocolate chip cupcakes. I will be back! I always get the chocolate chip one and a chocolate chip one.
Food,4.5,CG,Today I visited for the first time and the ice cream was fantastic. The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable. The flavor was spot on. The ice cream was tasty. The waffle cone was a little hard to eat. I would come back for the ice cream.The staff was friendly and helpful. I was looking for some things
Food,2.5,CG,This is a market where you can buy anything you want for a cheaper price. I went there to buy two small bags of housewares and some basic essentials. I was very impressed by the selection and selection. I found a few items I was looking for and some items I was looking for. The place was clean and nicely decorated
Food,4.5,CG,"OMG where to start!? The ice cream is amazing and you can't go wrong with the fruit toppings. If you want to try a flavor that is different than what you normally get, this is the place to go. I can't wait to come back and try other flavors!Great coffee and service."
Food,4.5,CG,I received a mini cupcake (I'm a vegan and I'm not a vegan) and the cupcake was delicious. The cake itself was moist and the frosting was great. The icing was a little hard and the icing on the cake was a little dry. I ordered a double chocolate and a chocolate chip cookie.
Food,4.5,OR,"Stopped by for a soft opening and came out with 2 drinks! Staff was helpful and drinks came out perfect. We bought the rose blossom and Korean rose. The building itself was large, so I won't have to worry about bundling close to other people when it gets busy. I highly recommend stopping by when you have the chance. Definitely a place to hang out and study."
Food,4.5,OR,"Thanksgiving night...everything is closed and we are THIRSTY! Thank goodness we found this gem! Their beer is Delicious, the inside is cozy and the patio is perfect! The patio is lit up with games, good music and always good people. We had a pleasure of meeting two of the owners and their adorable pup Gucci that everyone fell in love with. We will be return customers! :)"
Food,4.5,OR,"If you love coffee go to FPC, if you don't love it still go to FPC! So, I don't like coffee. But I dislike mornings more and find coffee to be a necessity.  I got a bag of FPC medium roast coffee and I really like it. It's the only coffee I can drink black and enjoy every sip. Please support an awesome local coffee roasters"
Food,5.0,OR,You know your city is coming into it's own when a great shop like this decides to come to town. It's not just the vast selection of unique and interesting oil and vinegars...they also have gourmet salts from all over the world! Our current favourites are the frantoio olive oil from South Africa and the 18 year old dark balsamic vinegar. Great location on 104 Street Downtown.
Food,4.5,OR,"So sorry the pretzels are good.  
We did come later in the morning, and the pretzels were not really fresh.  Mine was a bit on the hard side but did taste good.  Guess I am spoiled.  I like them newly out of the oven.  We will try again when we are in the area.  My friend likes this place a lot."
Food,4.5,OR,"We came all the way from Miami, FL to try Kava at this place. Ashley is amazing and I would try anything she suggested. 

One customer told me: ""I love coming here because the atmosphere of this place brought our neighborhood community together and it is so welcoming that lots of us come here regularly.""

If you are even the slightest bit interested in Kava, try this place."
Food,4.0,OR,"I have to say it doesnt get any better than this store.  Anything you want, it will 100% be here and it is always cheaper than any other place.  The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  I have never had a problem finding what I am looking for.  

Everyone knows I love my beer, and this is the best place to get it!!!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I've been here so many times since my last review. It's become a staple place, since it's close to Ace Hardware and Target.

My most recent visit was for very specific things. (I guess all grocery-shopping trips should include a list.)

I cruised down the aisles, found what I needed, did self check-out, and was on my way. I don't know what you could want that they don't have."
Food,4.0,OR,I pick up some donuts from here almost every weekend. Their donuts are to die for and yet their hot breakfast selection is just as good. Their prices are cheaper than most other brunch places and you can buy a bottle of orange juice and champagne from the store and have a much better brunch with better food at your house without waiting forever for a table.
Food,3.0,OR,"Did not really believe in readings but wanted to try it out. Saw Rose who was amazingly accurate without asking me any questions or me saying anything to give her hints I am a little impressed!!  She did a palm reading which I thought would be the most accurate. 
Also bought a cool mask that was made in Guyana  for my son. Very interesting store."
Food,2.5,OR,"Acme has always been my ""it's close to home, I don't feel like driving all the way to shoprite,"" but every time I go, I'm reminded why I'd rather be at shoprite. They seem to never have enough inventory, the pricing is always a bit higher, and the cashiers are....rude. The past few times I have went, I made it a point to do self check out."
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is really cool. They make your ice cream right in front of you, so it takes a little while to get through the line. They have several vegan options and they can do a lot of dairy free as well. I got the soy mint chip and really enjoyed it. It's a fun place to go after a long day of activities in the city."
Food,4.5,OR,"Delicious custard at a good price!
We were lucky there wasn't a line when we came as it was raining the service was quick and there was plenty to choose from. I ordered the cookie dough concrete the size was huge & cheap and most importantly delicious. Very cool stop along Rt 66 and I will be back again for more if I'm ever in the area again!"
Food,3.0,OR,"I had to say great job here.  The Staff they have makes me come back. Whether they are collecting baskets outside or calling up more checkers, even late at night because they see a line forming, they are always cheerful and helpful.  The rumor that I buy a lot of Zingers there is true, but they are for my pets-not me.  Uhummm..  Thanks..."
Food,4.0,CG,Tosti's you are the best. I have been here a couple of times now and every time is so delicious. The staff is always so friendly and knowledgeable. I always get the earl grey tea and it is so refreshing. The shop is always clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful.
Food,4.5,CG,"The coffee is good, but not spectacular.  It is a little on the pricier side, but the quality is very good.  There is also a nice selection of pastries and pastries.

I would definitely recommend this coffee shop to anyone!They are"
Food,4.0,CG,"This is a cute, convenient location. The coffee is good, but not spectacular. I order the extra mile and extra mile to get a solid cup of coffee. This place is very small but it's well worth the drive. I would recommend it for coffee and to some people.I love love love this place! I've been to"
Food,3.5,CG,"I went in, waited and checked out the menu and decided what to order. The guy working the counter was so nice and the place was clean and inviting. I got the strawberry cheesecake and it was so good. Definitely will be back for sure.This was our first time coming here and we loved it. They have a wide variety"
Food,4.0,CG,"Had a cookie sundae because it was the only one in the area. When I got home, the cookie was not the best I've ever had but the flavor was good. I would definitely go back. The staff was extremely friendly. I was greeted immediately and they have a great selection of ice cream flavors."
Food,3.5,CG,"When we moved to Garfield, we had the opportunity to try out a few of the beers on tap. We had the opportunity to try a few of their beers and the first was definitely the best. The staff was very friendly and I would highly recommend them. This is a great local brewery with great beer. I will definitely be back."
Food,4.0,CG,"After switching office locations, I had to go to the one in town. This location is a bit older and has a very limited selection of items. The staff was friendly and helpful.I was so excited to see this place open in the same strip mall. This is a great local brewery with great food. The beer is great and they"
Food,4.5,CG,"Iced coffee was great but not my favorite. I love that they have a couple different coffee options. I think they're open late, so it's pretty nice to have a little breakfast in the morning. I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me."
Food,4.0,CG,"Part of our recent week, we had an opportunity to take a tour of the winery and we were so impressed. The tasting room was beautiful and the tour was so great. The tasting room was well kept and clean. We learned a lot about the area and the history of the winery. The tasting room was the most beautiful part"
Food,4.5,CG,"DEFINITELY put this on your list of top quality ice cream places in Reno!  I was just in town and needed a dessert spot, so I decided to go to this place.  The place was super cute and clean.  The staff were super friendly and helpful.  The ice cream was a bit sweet for my taste"
Food,3.0,CG,"Love this location! Was my first time at the store and I will definitely be going back!I am a huge fan of the bakery, but this is the first time I have been treated so poorly. I ordered a birthday cake for my sister's birthday. I was so happy to have the cake delivered to my mother's house and it"
Food,4.0,CG,"It's undeniable: Brennan's is one of the top quality ice cream places in town! Their variety of flavors is a bit limited, but I am a huge fan of their ""good"" ice cream flavors. They offer many unique flavors, which is always a plus. I always get the ""Big Apple"" (mint ice cream with the"
Food,4.5,CG,"The staff was very attentive, and the drinks were very good.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the location is small, but if you're a local, this is a great place to get a drink or two. If you're looking for a good place to study, this is a great spot to get"
Food,4.5,CG,A cute little ice cream shop. The owner is super friendly and nice and always makes sure you are satisfied. The ice cream is so creamy and delicious!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I love this place! I've been to several
Food,4.0,OR,"What a nice surprise and fabulous view at the top of the stairs on the wharf ... We not only lucked out with a perfectly sunny day, but had a chance meet one of the family run business owners and taste some very nice wines ...keep up the good work Deep Sea... One of the most consistently good wines, bottle by bottle, in our wine adventures this weekend!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Call me slightly disappointed on this one.

The location is great.  Variety of rooms for workshops, performances, and banquets is good.

BUT

I participated in both a luncheon and brunch and the food was not up to par.  Your typical rubber chicken, dry desserts, and lack of flavor.  

The temperature is a real issue.  In some rooms, we suffered frostbite and in others it was unbearably warm."
Food,1.5,OR,"The absolute worst pharmacy I have ever used. No matter if you try the drive-through you're going to wait at least 15-20 minutes, in my case today I was second in line and waited 47 minutes. If you go inside it's no better dirty, people screaming about their prescriptions and far understaffed. 

Do you yourself a favor and call your prescription in to the one on Rosa Parks"
Food,4.0,OR,"Had two scoops of the moosetracks ice cream. It was pretty tasty. It's a good place to stop, eat some ice cream, make small talk with the guy sitting next to you at the counter and people watch. 

Best ice cream every? Nah, Bi-rite Creamery in San Francisco is still my fav. But Bassett's definitely doing something right if they're the oldest ice cream business in the US."
Food,4.5,OR,"Farm City Coffee is conveniently located inside the Nashville Farmer's Market. We arrived shortly after they were opening up, so we had to wait a little while for our drinks and the signage on the bakery items was from the previous day. The coffee was worth the wait, though! Their menu is quite extensive, with surely something for everyone's tastes. It's affordably-priced and made fresh upon ordering, too."
Food,4.5,OR,"Very helpful staff! It's one of my ultimate places to go in Edmonton for cake-decorating tools and supplies. When you are at the till, you might be surprised at the discounts they give you for buying Wilton products. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the Wilton brand fondant as it tends to crack/dry out. Get Satin Ice from Qzina/Cake Mischief or Virgin Ice from Bulk Barn instead."
Food,3.5,OR,"Huge eyeglasses sale on right now. 50% off glasses and frames. Staff is lovely especially opticians. 

I come here every week. It's a super convenient location with a huge lot. Good looking produce and an excellent variety of foods including ethnic aisles.

If your into points get the points card. I get free groceries ($200) once a year. It's affiliated with Essi and Shoppers so they add up quickly."
Food,4.0,OR,"A rainy day in Philly, visiting family. My brother and I hit this place twice within two hours. It was a beautiful place filled with liquid happiness, Cute hipster chick behind the counter and knowledgeable hipster guys talking about beer. ""My beard....my tattoos....my rumpled flannel shirt and super cool wrist bands....""
I hate hipsters but love beer. If you want to poison your mind with tasty beer, go here."
Food,2.0,OR,"Sorry to put it this way but this location is ghetto, period. It's not even the fact that it's in the hood, it's just the staff is pretty rude and unhelpful. They don't keep up with the store in the sense that it's much dirtier and less organized than other locations. The lines go to the back of the entire store and the parking lot is a nightmare."
Food,4.0,OR,"TJ is actually cheaper than Whole Foods believe it or not.

Also, i take away one star because they don't carry everything and do have a limited selection. But, they are so friendly and have a very 'cute' store with little decorations, etc. A lot more personable and manageable than Whole Foods.

For bachelors/college students: go to their frozen food section and grab about 20 burritos for the next month."
Food,1.5,OR,"At Walmart trying to buy ammo again today.  I've been waiting another 30 minutes for them to find someone who has a FOID card to ring me up.  A complete joke.  This is the standard experience, not the exception.  If you're going to put it on your shelves, hire someone to sell it.  Very frustrating and a known problem they refuse to fix"
Food,4.5,OR,"Great place... being raised at the Jersey Shore we were a bit jaded coming in.

They have a HUGE selection of taffy flavors; we mixed them up with Creamsicle​, coconut, Smores, buttered popcorn and a few others.

My sister in law tried some chocolate and ​enjoyed it.

The woman in the store was warm and friendly, answered any questions and was very helpful.

Beautiful place to shop for snacks along the boardwalk."
Food,4.5,OR,"Continuing my Indian grocery tour, we come to Himalayan. This is a great store with a good selection of spices,  rice, and produce. They also have some delicious looking hot food- including chana and samosas- we didn't purchase this trip but made a mental note to return to try. I purchased Bedekar's mixed pickles, fresh okra, some biscuits for Publius Jr. , and a Dairy Milk for Mrs. Publius."
Food,3.5,OR,"Dr. Le is kind, thoughtful, detailed and thorough.  She has an easy manner and a good heart.  She's not looking to sell something you don't need.  The Vision Center itself is busy and service is often less than fabulous but Dr. Le makes up for it all.  Appointments are easy to secure, she is usually on time, and her manner is professional and personal."
Food,4.5,CG,We stopped here for breakfast and an iced coffee. I got a simple latte and it was delicious. The barista was very friendly and made the drinks even more great.I'm so excited to see this place open in the neighborhood! I love the decor and the vibe! I love the vintage chairs and the old school decor. 
Food,4.5,CG,"The only negative about this location is the fact that it's a little further from the freeway than the other two locations. The parking lot is also small, and there are a lot of spaces to sit and watch the movie. I would suggest coming here if you're in the area.This is a great place to come and grab a drink or"
Food,4.5,CG,Absolutely loved it. Plenty of seating and the bartender was very knowledgeable about the history of the distillery. We had the opportunity to try a few of their spirits and bought a bottle of their vodka. They had a few tastings on the menu and some bottles of their spirits. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean.
Food,4.5,CG,"So first, the entrance is locked. The entrance is in the back. There is a large sign. There are a couple of people behind the counter but the counter is not open. There is a small table in the back. I am not sure if it was because it was closed for the day. There is a small sign on the door"
Food,4.5,CG,fantastic chocolates and great service. We will be back!Very good smoothies! The guy working the counter is so nice and the place is clean and inviting!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I was looking for a quick
Food,3.5,CG,"They are a good store, but it's a long drive for me.

The store is always clean and well-stocked, and the staff is always friendly.

I like that they have a few in the produce section, and some in the seafood department.

They also have a great selection of the most popular items"
Food,4.5,CG,"I can't believe I've never been to the market before. I saw a lot of people eating the pastries and I had to get a bagel with cream cheese, so it was pretty nice. They had a few flavors of bagels that were very good. I got the peanut butter one and it was pretty good."
Food,4.5,CG,I ordered cookies to give back to the family and they were all very delicious. I will definitely be ordering from them again! I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the service is so friendly. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I love this place! I've been to several locations
Food,4.0,CG,Second time I've dropped into this place and the girl in front of me was just hanging out and we sat down.  The place is small and is a little tight so it's not that it's a great place to hang out.  There are a couple of tables and chairs for people to sit.  They also have some outdoor seating
Food,4.0,CG,This is probably my favorite ice cream place ever! The employees are always so kind and accommodating and the atmosphere is always very cute. The ice cream is the best in the city and it's worth the visit. It's a little pricey but it's worth it!It's not that I love a Target but I love the store and the employees
Food,4.0,CG,"I love this farmers market. We have been going to this farmers market since they opened. It has a nice atmosphere.  The people there are very friendly and helpful.  They have a nice selection of local produce and meats.   The produce is always fresh and the staff is always friendly.  

The only thing I can"
Food,3.5,CG,"This Randall's isn't as large as it used to be. It's a lot bigger and cleaner than the other locations. 

However, the grocery section is a bit of a pain to navigate. I don't really care for the fact that it is very close to my house. I always feel like I'm walking out of a"
Food,3.5,CG,"The Whole Foods here is a little more expensive than other Whole Foods. However, the customer service is a little slow. The people who work here are the most rude and unprofessional people I've encountered. 

The produce is always fresh and the service is excellent. The staff is always friendly. And they have the most convenient delivery option"
Food,4.5,OR,Came here to try some beer with some friends. We got a flight for $10. The beer was so tasty but a little on the stronger side! I really liked the outdoor set up and also the inside seating area. It looked super fancy and the bartenders were friendly. My friend and I each choose the beers. We mainly got the blonde ales and a couple other darker ones.
Food,4.0,OR,"Simple little bakery.  In a hurry stopped by on a whim when we saw the name.  No tables, all pick up and go. They have gluten free and low carb breads along with plenty of regular varieties too. Doughnuts, pastries and bagels. Baklava filled traditionally or with pastacios and/or chocolate covered. Cookies, dolmas, pizza dough, tabule, hummus of every sort, home made pita and so much more."
Food,4.0,OR,"If you must find a coffee shop near downtown, but not deep in the flustercluck of it all and appreciate not having to pay for parking, this is a good choice. The staff is friendly and keeps the place tidy. The place is frequently packed. In the summer, lots of outdoor seating. Peak times are a pain in the backside due to size and configuration of the parking lot."
Food,4.0,OR,"Their red-haired overweight employee must be on crack. She was kind of jittery the last time and I've been there and I overheard her calling me a ""retard,"" because I didn't notice that she has just closed her cashier. I asked to talk to the manager about it, and after waiting in vain for some time for him to show up, I gave up and left. Never returning again."
Food,4.0,OR,"I got a $3 milk shake. It was a flavored syrup added to ice cream to get your flavor. Meh. Could barely taste any ""flavor"". I guess you get what you pay for. 

It's a shame because I'm here on vacation (who isn't?) and it's right across the street from where I'm staying. I don't know about you, but in my book, vacation could easily mean daily ice cream."
Food,4.5,OR,"Correction on hours open.  The tasting room is open until 10pm on Thursday through Saturday, so odds are better I can go sip a few.   Excellent!

BTW the owner very courteously thanked me for my review and gave me the correct hours.  Good interaction.  So clearly they care about Yelp reviews and want  to keep customers informed.  All the more reason to visit."
Food,4.5,OR,"I've never been here before and I told the barista.  He helpfully explained all of the varieties of drinks: coffee, latte, flat white, teas, etc and then asked if I had any questions.  He then showed me the pastry case- yum!!  Got a flat white-Delish-see my pics and choc chip cookie.  In heaven.  Perfect thing to warm me up on a freezing STL day."
Food,3.5,OR,"Lot's of potential here, and a great foundation to build it from. The beer selection is small, but they will give you samples of whatever you ask for....I love the nostalgic vibe of the building, and the staff are friendly and know their stuff.    The patio out back is nice and comfy....and I hear there are upgrades coming soon for a bit more entertainment out there!"
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is a hidden gem in STL. I love everything about! they have Lavazza coffee beans, its a must try if you never did before. I am a cake person not a macron person but the flavors are amusing/fresh and just Delish!
Top all of that with clean place and owner Jim is such a wonderful and welcoming person.
Its a great place to relax, enjoy ur coffee/dessert and work."
Food,4.5,OR,"I don't live in St Louis, but my best friend does. She had a personal tragedy and I wanted to send her an  ice cream care package (because ice cream = love) but she lived outside of Clementine's delivery radius. I explained the situation and they went above and beyond and delivered to her anyway. She says it's delicious! They're amazing people who apparently make delicious ice cream."
Food,3.5,OR,Watch your money. If you pay cash they may scam you out of your change and if you challenge them they can't provide proof of what you gave them and then tell you to call the police to report them!  Really???? Pay card!  Then the customers behind you want to call you a Penis.  Brains abound in this area but they are not in the head!!!!!
Food,2.5,OR,We moved here a year ago and always had the best experience with Click list at our old store. It's not just COVID affecting it; I've consistently waited 20+ minutes for my pick up for the last year at the Brentwood location. And there's always several items listed as out of stock on my receipt but if I go inside the store the items are always on the shelf.
Food,4.0,OR,"Came in a few weeks ago.  Tried the brownie sundae.  It was delish and packed to the brim (enough to share for sure). The ordering system/crowd was chaotic and I felt rushed because of the amount of people. Not the fault of the establishment by any means, in fact the employees were pleasant. Happy to see them so busy!  We'll be back with our little one."
Food,4.0,CG,"Bacon hash is heaven in a bun, with a bit of a kick to it. I'm not a fan of the bacon hash, but it is the perfect balance of salty and salty. If you like spicy hash, this is a good choice. This is also a great place to visit if you're in the area!They are always busy"
Food,4.0,CG,"I came here when Doughboy opened and the ice cream was fantastic. The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable. The flavor of the cake was also very good. Definitely a great treat! We will be back!This place is a dump. There are only two registers open. The lines are always long. And they close at 9am. 
"
Food,4.5,CG,The coffee is certainly very good. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the customer service. I've had the best experience with both the staff and the customer service. I've been to many coffee shops in the area and this one is by far the best.The staff was friendly and helpful. I ended up going with the honey almond m
Food,3.5,CG,"The produce here is hit or miss, the produce is too cold or too cold, and the produce is so overpriced.

I have also tried the orange juice which is"

Food,4.0,CG,"If you want to taste some of the offerings, try the cold brew! It's strong and refreshing. If you want to try a few flavors, the flavor selection is great.I'm so excited to see this place open in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe. I love the vintage chairs and chairs and the owner is very friendly"
Food,3.5,CG,"I was visiting from Orlando, and I was craving ice cream.  I had a hard time deciding what to get.  The staff was helpful and friendly, and the place was packed.  I ended up getting the flight of 4 different flavors.  My boyfriend got the vanilla bean, and he loved it.  I will definitely be back."
Food,2.5,CG,"The employees are so preoccupied and have no idea what they're doing. There's a person who doesn't know what they're doing, and they're the only ones in the store. The only thing I can say is, I'm not sure why they're doing that. The staff is always extremely rude and incompetent. I understand they are busy"
Food,4.0,CG,"I thought it was an ice cream cone with ice cream but it was delicious. I was disappointed. I had the cookies and cream, both were very good. The only reason I gave this place a five star is because the staff was extremely rude. I was charged for two cones for the price. I will never come back to this place."
Food,4.0,CG,"This is a super convenient location. The only problem is that it's close to the airport and we have yet to find a spot, but that is the only reason we go there. We go here everyday and we will be back. I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me."
Food,1.5,CG,Worst service. ALWAYS a big line. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the store is a mess.  The people behind the counter are the worst.  They don't even know what they are doing.  I've been there for years and always get the same thing.  They don't have the order bookmarked on
Food,4.0,CG,We were going here a few weeks ago and we decided to go back for a drink and just grab a cup of coffee and some beers.  The place was clean and the staff was nice.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view.  This is a great place for a cold brew.  They have a small outdoor patio area with
Food,3.5,CG,"Don't use the floral department here. The only reason I don't go here is because I'm a self check out person. I am a self check out person, so it is pretty easy to do. 

The staff is always friendly. I come here to check out the products and the prices. They have the most convenient place in"
Food,4.5,CG,"I wasn't happy with the ice cream, but the prices are a little higher than the local ice cream shops. The flavor is definitely not worth the extra money you spend. The ice cream is worth it. It's not cheap, but it is worth it.I've been coming here since I was a kid. I've been to several locations"
Food,4.5,CG,Awesome presentation of the worst ice cream I've ever had. My husband got a vanilla bean and he said it was the best he's ever had. The flavor was so good and it was worth the price. It was a little pricey for what it is and I would recommend getting the cones instead. The place is really cute and cute.
Food,4.0,CG,"Friendly, positive staff welcomed my group of 3 with a smile.

The cheese board was awesome.

I had the Chicken wings.  The chicken was tasty.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was a little pricey for the portion size.  But the wings were also great.  I liked the cheese board. "
Food,3.0,OR,"I come here and order drinks at least twice a week. Every time I ask for light ice, they fail to make my drinks correctly.
Today was the buy a drink and get a free pastry.  I bought two drinks and was only allowed to get one pastry.  There was nothing written anywhere stating that there was only a single pastry allowed per purchase of one or more drinks"
Food,5.0,OR,"One of my favorite coffee shops in Indy. It's a little hidden gem that's connected to a barber shop and serves amazing coffee. I loooove their cortados and cold brew. They also serve up some other fun espresso drinks, like the pineapple ube, that I've been meaning to try. Not to mention, they always have delicious baked goods on deck - highly recommend the chocolate chunk cookie with sea salt!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I haven't been here in years. I was so happy to see that they survived the Ina Rd. construction. I had my hubby run in for a cinnamon roll, but they were all out (for good reason) so I opted for an apple fritter. It was the best apple fritter I've had in years and it was nearly the size of my head! Can't wait to go back."
Food,4.0,OR,"I absolutely LOVE their salad bar!! Hands down, the BEST!! Everything is always fresh and if something is gone or out? The Fresh Thyme Team is quick to assist in obtaining more from the back..even if that requires them making it fresh! I literally eat there 4 or 5 times a week :-D They have some pretty tasty cucumber - peppermint water too! Great store, awesome products, excellent customer service."
Food,1.5,OR,"Rude. The lady at the register didn't say one word to me and ignored me when I said hi, but proceeded to kindly greet her male customers behind me. She also gave me dirty looks the entire time during our interaction. It doesn't seem like I'm the only one who feels this way, either. When I go in with my husband I never encounter this issue."
Food,4.0,OR,"So I don't get it.  I order the same thing every time I go to Starbucks, no matter which Starbucks I go to.  I always get the Grande Soy Misto with 2 Splenda.  However, no matter where I go, it seems I am charged a different price each time.  This Starbucks consistently doesn't charge me extra for soy milk.  Yay!  I'm a fan :-)"
Food,5.0,OR,We randomly booked a tour at this tiny distillery as part of a bachelorette party. Heather did a great job leading the tour. The tour was $15 and includes a tasting of different rums and a choice of one of several of their rum cocktails. It was such a pleasant place to hang out (the main indoor area and the back patio) that we stayed for another drinks.
Food,3.5,OR,"I really liked this place when it first opened. But the staff has become progressively more unprofessional. While placing an order the cashier was more interested in chatting with his coworkers. As a result I had to tell him my order (which was simple - a latte - that's it, nothing fancy) three times before he finally got it. They get 0 stars for service. One star for the decor."
Food,2.0,OR,"I feel sad for the other employees. Shannon at Starbucks was rolling her eyes at them, yelling at one of the younger girl(Isabella I believe) for asking her ""too many questions"" and kept raising her voice saying ""OH MY GOSHHHHH"" towards her 

She was also ignoring the customers because she was so flustered with the other employees (who were not doing anything wrong)

It costs $0 to be a kind human."
Food,4.0,OR,"Yes, it's true that this place feels somewhat like a study hall in that people are here with their laptops and books - studying, working, or just relaxing. But, the cafe has a very relaxed community feel. The background music is great and the large windows provide natural light. Very cute and relaxing place if you just want to escape from the city life! The coffee and pastries are good."
Food,2.0,OR,"This has always been an easy Walmart to shop at after work
Plus it stays open till 11pm at night

It has all the usual food and groceries
Pharmacy and products
Clothes and shoes 
Your usual Walmart for everything you need 

Parking lot isn't as big as some of the others 
It's an older Walmart 
But it still has all your basic needs available for your purchase 

They do have a self check out"
Food,2.0,OR,Seriously the worst service I have ever seen. Employees standing around with 6 deep people in line to purchase food. 9 people deep in the customer service line. I went to self check out and the girl helping in the self check out area was rude and snarky!!! So rude. I will never go back to Walmart. The employees are unhappy in motivated to make the customer happy.
Food,4.0,OR,"This is basically your standard typical DIY frozen yogurt spot where they sell by the weight. I did feel there were a lot more toppings than most places I had been to, but nothing particularly made this place stand out. 
They had several choices to choose from so that made it pretty difficult to decide which to pick, so of course I kind of had a little bit of everything!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Yazoo has plenty of seating and is located in the popular Gulch area. However, I am just not that impressed with their beer. It is probably my least favorite brewery in Nashville, although I have yet to visit Little Harpeth. Servers at Yazoo were just fine, but unless the beer selection is suited to your taste, it's nothing to write home about. I would still recommend giving it a try."
Food,4.0,OR,"From Florida went to Boyds based on Jalapeno wine description on the internet!  We were so pleased we did!  Its a wonderful winery and met Mr Boyd, extremely gracious.
Had a great light lunch and tried Jalapeno wine-- pleasantly surprised!! Bought a few bottles to share with our family, love tasting new things. 

Ally our wine server was informative and we 
Liked and bought Chardonnay our go to wine!"
Food,2.0,OR,It was sweet how the lady said she wanted to make my drinks right but the whole experience was trash. I asked for an iced coffee with four cream four sugar which was ALL cream. I asked for cold brew with almond milk and Stevia and got black coffee with no sweetener. Also they didn't let me know my stuff was ready so I literally waited 20 minutes for garbage.
Food,4.5,CG,"Slow as molasses!!!! The 2 girls behind the counter were just standing around talking to each other and just staring at each other. The girl behind the counter was the rudest person I've ever met. She was so rude and just said ""I can't help you."" I was so pissed I had to yell at her. I was also in the"
Food,4.0,CG,I liked this place a lot. The only reason I didn't give this place a 4 star is because I felt the prices are a bit high but the service was pretty good.I'm so excited to have found a good grocery store in the area! This is my go to for the best produce. I have to stop here every time I'm in
Food,2.0,CG,I despise this location.  They have the worst customer service I have ever encountered.  I just moved here from Los Angeles and I am a regular and have never been treated so poorly.  I have had to call in a prescription for a prescription for my daughter who is from Los Angeles.  They never answer my call and when I tell them I
Food,5.0,CG,"Okay seriously this is the best ice cream ever!  I will say that the best part about this place is the unique flavors.  There are so many different kinds to choose from and they change daily.  It's a great place to hang out with friends and eat.

They also have a great outdoor seating area and also a great outdoor seating"
Food,3.5,CG,Can I say that I'm not an expert on the beer but it's my go to beer store. I had the Chicken wings and the Chocolate Cracker. Both were very good. I also had the BBQ sauce. Both were very good. I liked the BBQ sauce. The texture of the chicken was a bit odd.
Food,4.5,CG,Love their beer. I live close to the brewery and love the location. Definitely a must go if you're in the area!I am a huge fan of Treme Donuts. This place is a great little place in the heart of St. Pete. I always get the same thing every time. The place is clean and the staff is very friendly
Food,4.0,CG,"The store is located in a shopping center with a parking lot.  There is a large store front and a small refrigerated area, both in the back.  There is a large selection of liquor and spirits.  The staff is very knowledgeable about the products and the store is very clean.  The store is also well-stocked and well-"
Food,4.5,CG,"The amount of times I've gone, the workers are very rude. There is a person who doesn't know how to make the drinks. He then proceeds to say ""no, it's just a matter of personal preference."" I'm not sure if he was having a bad day or something. I'm not sure if the store manager is the owner or"
Food,4.5,CG,"Ordered cupcakes for a babyshower. They were the only cupcake I could find that had the flavor of the cupcake. The cake itself was very dry, and the icing was very sugary. The icing on top was a little too sweet for my liking. I ordered a double chocolate and a chocolate chip cookie."
Food,4.0,CG,"I like spacious cafes. Nothing else has to offer. The coffee is good, the people are friendly and the coffee is good. I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I love this place! I've been to several locations in"
Food,2.5,CG,"Run of the mill Walgreen's.

I go here at least once a week.  There is a decent selection of other items.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  There is always a line out the door and the store is always busy.  If you need to run in and get something, it's usually a quick stop"
Food,3.0,CG,It's a Starbucks with a drive thru and the drive thru is a lot more convenient. I ordered a coffee and it was delicious. The girl at the window was friendly and it was pretty busy. They had a few flavors of water ice that I ordered but I didn't find any that I liked. The place was clean and nicely decorated.
Food,2.0,CG,"A smile would be nice.Came here on a recent trip to Tampa. I was pretty disappointed. There was a lot of room for the kids to play, so it was pretty cramped. They had a few games to play, but it was a little loud. There was also a long line. I ended up going to the bar and got a"
Food,5.0,CG,I picked up my Thanksgiving turkey and the turkey sausage. I also picked up a small slice of turkey sausage from the deli. The turkey sausage is the best I've ever had. The chicken sausage is crunchy and the turkey is flavorful. I love the pork sausage. The turkey sausage is a bit too spicy for me.
Food,4.5,OR,"Great staple to the Asian food markets here in Tampa Bay.  MD is one of the largest in the area and they have a great selection of different Asian staples from Vietnamese to Chinese and Korean and Japanese.

I could probably spend an hour in their ramen and candy/treats aisles alone.  My typical staples from MD are the already prepared pork (big serving and cheap!), pastry items, and fresh produce."
Food,4.5,OR,"I have come here a number of times now. They have a really good selection of beers and always something new they are working on. Bands playing, games to play with friends like ping pong, giant checkers, chess and more. It's nice and quiet during the day to sit back and enjoy a beach blonde and jumpin during the night to rock out with a phantasmis. Two thumbs up from me."
Food,4.5,OR,Huge Asian market with a excellent produce section especially mushrooms of various kinds and great baby Bok Choi. The hot food section is a great place to get a meal for a very reasonable price. This business is also caring for the health and safety of its customers and employees by having common sense COVID requirements especially with the Delta Variant sweeping Florida. Worth the drive and I will definitely return.
Food,4.5,OR,"The Day Fresh Tour gives you a great overview of the history of AB, a visit to the Clydesdales, the brewing process, beechwood aging cellar, and bottling lines, followed by a fresh beer to drink and an even fresher one to bring home to chill before consuming. Nicely organized and executed. There is a whole museum section post tour you should make sure you leave time to peruse."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great produce for excellent prices that consistently beats the supermarket.  Apples are between .99 and 1.49/lb, hearts of romain between $2 and $3, and tomatos are between .99 and 1.99/lb.  Typically towards the front of their section in Reading Terminal Market they have the best deals like $.99 container of grape tomatos or a $1 bag of apples.  Also a good place for eggs, milk, and dried fruit."
Food,4.5,OR,My children and I love this place. The dairy products are A++++++. But the animals make the experience one of a kind. My oldest ( 19) and youngest (3) fell in love with the baby goats. We held them and played with them. We are heading back today since I am out of milk and eggs but first we will hit the store for carrots and apples for our new friends!
Food,2.0,OR,This the absolute worst Kroger in Indy. I've bought and returned meat to this store several times. I stopped after seeing a pallet of ground beef left by the cooler for over 30 minutes. They should seriously be investigated for selling tainted meat. Went there tonight at 10pm and there was 30 people in line and one cashier with a rentacop sidekick looking at everyone like they were thieves.
Food,3.5,OR,"First time here and last time here. I ordered four cupcakes at $3.50 each. Each cupcake was dry and tasted like it was past its prime. It was not fresh at all. Both cake and frosting sat around too long. They were a real disappointment. 
I would not recommend this place. 
I visited this place after eating a late lunch at Great Full (next door to Batch, that food was delicious)."
Food,3.5,OR,"I received an assortment of cookies as a welcome gift yesterday evening, and they were still warm when they were delivered at my doorstep. The sweetness varies a smidgen based on the type of cookie; I personally enjoy the Snickerdoodle because it's not too sweet. However, all of the types that I have tried were nice and gooey when warm and remained soft and chewy after they cooled. Good, solid cookies."
Food,2.0,OR,Used to go here every Saturday until the selection dwindled away. No more sour cream donuts? Does not matter if you go in at 6am or 10am selection is pitiful. Complaining to managers does no good. They just offer you a free dozen of the horrible selection. There are too many good donuts out there to subject yourself to this mess. This evaluation is based on the last year of visits.
Food,4.0,OR,"This was my first time here and I loved it! I tried the charcoal vanilla vegan ice cream and it was so good! It's only available for a short amount of time so I would recommend to get it soon! 

The staff here are sweet and patient. They answered all my questions and didn't make me feel like an idiot after asking twenty questions. Definitely worth the trip to La Encantada!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Crappy neighborhood, suspect-looking drive-thru with meth heads buzzing all around, BUT friendly service and trust me when I tell you that they got what you need.  Comet?  They got you.  Sponges?  Yup.  Heineken Light?  Yes indeed.  How about toilet paper?  You better believe it.  And with no grocery stores in sight, I'm guessing they do a killer business.  Will definitely return."
Food,4.5,OR,"Extremely underwhelmed I was excited to try but they had horrible customer service and when I asked for a simple request to take some of the ice out so I could shut the On my drink I was handed a cup with no words. 
I would not recommend this place whatsoever based off of the customer service coming from working at a coffee shop I didn't think my request was unreasonable."
Food,5.0,OR,"I'm not usually into fruit wines but the wines here are SO DELICIOUS. I love the sweet oak aged blueberry but the black and blue and strawberry are great too. And it's right on a u pick farm so you can pick fruit and veggies, have a glass of wine, and if it's a Saturday maybe listen to a live band or grab food at the food truck."
Food,2.5,CG,"Walked in to grab a few things and the girl in front of me was just standing there and staring at me.  The guy behind me was polite, but not so great.  The place was filthy and the store smelled like trash.  I would not recommend this store.  I don't know how they can do it, but I'll never"
Food,4.5,CG,Best pretzel I've ever had.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the service is terrible.   The people behind the counter are the most rude and unprofessional people that I have ever encountered.   I will never shop here again.I've been coming here since I was a kid. I've been to several locations in
Food,5.0,CG,"I would highly recommend working with an employee at the drive-thru pharmacy. She was extremely helpful and so friendly. The store itself is very clean, and the store is very clean.The customer service is excellent. The staff is extremely friendly. My husband and I ordered a chai tea with oat milk. I was very satisfied with the boba"
Food,3.0,CG,"I could never give any more stars, as the prices are a bit higher than the local store.

I had a coupon for a free mini-mart gift card, and it was worth it.  It was a little pricey for what it is, but it was worth it.  The prices are a bit high, but I can't complain about"
Food,4.5,CG,"This is a small, two-way drive through, which is a nice touch. I order the extra mile from the front window. The girl at the window was friendly and made me feel like I was welcome. It was a little pricey for a regular coffee and tea. I would definitely return if I'm in the area!They are always busy, but"
Food,4.5,CG,Oh man!  This place is an absolute gem!  I will be going back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and she said no.  I was standing there and she looked at me and
Food,4.5,CG,"Want ice cream on that weekend. The only reason I don't give this place a 4 star is because it's the closest place to my house, but if you're a local, this place is a great place to go.I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I got the strawberry smoothie which was great and had"
Food,4.5,CG,"I've never been here when it was the only one in Nashville. 

The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. 

The only thing I wish they would improve was the service. I ordered a double espresso and a double espresso with soy milk. I got the double espresso"
Food,1.5,CG,This was part of the tour. The tasting was a good deal. The cheese plate was awesome. We had the opportunity to try a few of their chocolates. The cheese plate was amazing. We also had a good time sampling the rum. This was our first time in Santa Barbara and we will definitely be back!They are always busy but the service
Food,4.0,CG,"The ice cream is really good. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the customer service. I had an employee walk me through the drive thru, and the person who helped me was just as rude and rude. I'm not sure why I would come here again.Great location with great service. I have to say that I'm not a coffee drink"
Food,1.5,CG,They must have some bad days. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the store is a little small. The store itself is small but the employees are nice. I go here to pick up some things and the cashiers are always super friendly and helpful. The staff was very helpful. The place was clean and nicely decorated.
Food,4.5,CG,"This was my second time here and I thought it was pretty cool. There were a few tables and a couch.  The place is small and small, but there was a lot of seating. The staff was very friendly and I enjoyed the coffee. My boyfriend got the white chocolate chai and it was pretty good. I would definitely go back here if I"
Food,4.0,CG,This used to be my go to place for ice cream but now they close at 6pm and they close at 8pm. I am a bit disappointed that they are closing at 6pm. The customer service is great. The staff is always friendly. This store is always clean and the store is always well stocked. I will keep coming back.
Food,4.0,CG,"Just moved to the Tampa area and I thought it was a great place to go for a cup of coffee. I had the banana, egg and cheese croissant. The croissant was very good and the egg and cheese croissant was really good. I ordered the chai and a croissant. I did not get the chai lat"
Food,2.0,OR,"I give 0 stars due to rude, unprofessional service and incompetent workers. I feel they need to be retrained since almost NO ONE knows what their doing, I didn't realize it takes 3 people to watch hot chocolate being made and none of them would help the cashier after he asked 3 times. My family and friends will be told about the crapoy service and to NOT come here to this one!!!!!!!"
Food,2.0,OR,"Shopping at Eagles Park Publix on Park Street and 55th Ave. N., in St. Petersburg today. Ordered a couple of subs from the Deli and they were the best subs we've ever had from Publix. Nicole in the Deli waited on me and made sure they were the best made-to-order subs she'd ever made. Ask for Nicole the next time you want a delicious sub at the Publix Deli at Eagles Park!!"
Food,4.0,OR,Welcome to Brandon! Finally got a chance to stop by and check them out this weekend. The staff was very attentive and very knowledgable. The store has something for every budget and pallet. The wines are sectioned off with signs that guide you. They also sell various liquor and various beers if wine is not your thing. Over all I had a great experience and I know I will be returning.
Food,2.0,OR,"It is cheap because all the produce is bad or almost there.  Got sick as a dog from eating this, and what do you know - so did my actual dog!   1800$ in vet bills later he has something they claim is like e coli.  They have good deals on spices though, maybe those aren't as bad.  But seriously, just look at the oranges.  Enough said."
Food,4.5,OR,"Awesome experience,  knowledgeable driver. Just enough time at each stop. With the exception of Oaken Barrel the breweries were ready for us and awesome. Oaken Barrel rebounded fast and came through.  Mashcraft and Taxman were the best stops as service goes. Planetary Brewery had really good beer. Having said that every brewery had great beer, and isn't that the purpose.  See you in May, plan to book a bus."
Food,4.5,OR,"Goldie's Goodies Bakery is simply outstanding. The owner Sheree is great to work with and truly gifted at her craft. We have enjoyed a wide variety of treats from her bakery for home and office and all have been delicious. Recently Sheree made a wedding cake for a family wedding and it turned out great, made for a very happy bride, and was also delicious.  I highly recommend Goldie's Goodies Bakery.."
Food,4.5,OR,"If you're looking for that hipster coffee shop, you've found it. And if you're like me, you'll enjoy it. One of the best almond milk cortados I've ever had. The espresso was super smooth and flavorful. 

Minimalist vibe, super friendly staff and plenty of seating inside and out. It's a few blocks off state street so it seemed like a local crowd. There was consistently a line but it moved fairly quickly."
Food,4.0,OR,"Great, fantastic place to work with a steaming cup of coffee in hand. The huge glass doors mean a ton of light and a fresh, bright ambiance. The baristas are really hip, friendly and helpful. While the coffee is pricey, a regular cup is only slightly more expensive than La Va and comparable to Elixir. Great pastries. The goat cheese croissant is to DIE for. Beautiful shaded outdoor seating in the mornings."
Food,4.5,OR,"A few disclaimers:
1. I am not a Philly native
2. I do not consider myself a pretzel connoisseur.

Center City pretzel company is great for cheap fresh pretzels. They have very odd hours which makes it difficult to stop by. We came by early on a Sunday morning. The pretzels were cheap, warm, and soft. However, I personally feel like PPF and Federal pretzel are better in taste. Hence the 3 stars for flavor."
Food,4.5,OR,Cute store.  The owner happened to be in and was really nice and genuine.  They had some unique things.  Some slightly overpriced though.  There was a vintage baby scale that I was looking at that was pricced at $40.  Went to a thrift shop in another part of town and was able to find the same exact thing for 10 bucks.  Definitely a cute store nonetheless.
Food,4.0,OR,"I can't rave enough about my love for Dutch Bros. Coffee. Every trip to this part of town, has Dutch Bros. on the agenda.
On a suggestion from the staff, I went away from my usual and opted for the Toasted Mellow (breve). It did not disappoint. It is actually now my favorite drink and I order it a few times a week.  Thank you Dutch Bros. You and your staff rock."
Food,4.0,OR,"We love this place! For years I passed it longingly en route to Paso and SB. But last year, I finally popped in and became a member! We just stopped in again today and enjoyed a wonderful tasting with Tommy, a fellow runner and yogi. We always get great service and meet wonderful people there. And of course take home fabulous wine to share. Stop passing it by and stop in instead!"
Food,4.5,OR,"The moment you open up the door to walk in, you smell how delicious all of the freshly baked cookies are. It's a bit tough trying to decide what cookies to get since they're all really good. My daughter's literally like a kid in a candy shop when we go here because she can get one of every cookie. It's definitely a favorite to get dessert after eating dinner on Brookline Blvd."
Food,4.0,OR,"Best ice cream in Philly. Customer service is fantastic and the flavors are AMAZING 

We came in here to celebrate an special occasion, my wife mentioned that the ice cream looked more melty than expected and they made everything all over again to ensure that we were taken care of.

We did not ask for them to do it... they just wanted to make sure it was worth the price. It absolutely was."

Food,5.0,CG,The gin is great and the whiskey is good too. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in at around 3:15 on a Friday night and there was a line up to the door.  It was a little slow for a busy Saturday night.  There was no one behind us.  I was the only person in the store and it took
Food,4.0,CG,"Though my coffee tastings are always a little too long. I also love that they have a couple different coffee flavors. 

I love that they have a rewards program where you get free coffee and get free drinks in the free Starbucks app. I love that they have a loyalty program. 

The only downside to this location is the fact that it"

He also provided a great tour of the brewery and it was a great way to start a weekend. We will definitely be back!The staff was friendly and helpful. I was looking for some things I had to try on my
Food,4.5,CG,"Pros: Coconut Porter was excellent, a little bitter, and a little bitter for my liking. The only thing I would suggest is to get the T-shirt, it's a shame that it's not in the size of the one I ordered. I would definitely recommend a visit here for a beer and a hang out."
Food,4.5,CG,Stopped by this place on a whim and thought it was pretty cool. There were a few tables and a couch. The place itself is small but the service was pretty good. The bartender was very friendly and the place was clean. The food was ok. The food was good. I had a chicken salad with a side of cheese.
Food,4.0,CG,"If you are ever in Tampa, you should definitely stop by. The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and friendly. If you are in the area, I highly recommend you stop by and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed. The worst pharmacy I've ever had."
Food,4.0,CG,"Great little spot for healthy and tasty foods. 

We love that they have a couple different types of healthy foods and I am always able to get a couple of things I don't want to consume. 

The fresh produce is always fresh and always fresh. The staff is always friendly. And they have the most convenient delivery option in the area."
Food,4.0,CG,This place is just great. We have been coming here for a long time now and the staff has always been so friendly. The place is always clean and the atmosphere is so great. I'm so excited to have found this place in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe. I love the vintage chairs and the old school decor.
Food,4.5,CG,"38 years old, and JUST recently opened the doors to a new location.

The store has a nice selection of beers, but not as many choices as you'd expect from a large brewery. They had a few in the fridge, and it was pretty cool to see some of them being sold out.

The beer selection is good, but the prices"
Food,4.0,CG,"I found Hub when it first opened and thought it was a great place to go for a cup of coffee. I had the banana, egg and cheese croissant. The croissant was a little hard to chew, which was a little disappointing. I also noticed the coffee was also pretty good. I ended up going with the honey almond croissant."
Food,4.5,CG,Great location in beautiful Collingswood.  The coffee is good but nothing special.  I like the pastries and pastries.  The croissants are good but not great.  The place is small and not open.   The shop is small and is kinda small.  I think it's a good place to go if you are in the
Food,2.5,CG,"How is it possible to go to the market and try all the produce that is in season? 

I had the Chicken salad.  The chicken was tasty.  The other items were not.  It was good.  The mashed potatoes were OK.  The chicken was also pretty good. 

I did get a salad with the vegetables."
Food,4.5,CG,I love this place. Every time I visit the store they are always friendly and helpful. I just wish they had more unique items. The produce and meat section is always so fresh and delicious. I love that they have a good selection of organic foods. This store is always well stocked and the workers are always friendly. I will continue to shop at this store and
Food,3.0,CG,Got a cake for my daughter's birthday and it was absolutely delicious. The cake was moist and the icing was perfect. The cake was delicious and the cake was moist. The cake was so moist and had no issues with the icing. The cake was light and fluffy and the icing was perfectly flavorful. The cake was also delicious and very moist.
Food,4.5,OR,There are some great wineries in Indiana and this is definitely one. They are friendly but most importantly there is a wine for everyone and a wine shake that is fabulous. They are so nice and will make you feel like you are having a wine in the comfort of your home.  My favorite is the Cabernet but all the wines were really good even the sweet wine which isn't my favorite
Food,4.5,OR,"I went to Chestnut Hill Coffee Company in January 2018 to do some resume work. The employees were very friendly and I got my coffee and croissant immediately. There is a lot of room for sitting/working because they have an entire upstairs, but it does fill up! 
It was a good environment to get some work done, hushed conversations and not too loud of music. 
I would definitely recommend and will be returning."
Food,5.0,OR,"This was seriously one of the best tours I've ever done. Even with a very rainy day, we had a great time. Elizabeth is smart and hilarious. The group size was perfect. The cocktails were great, and you really do get plenty. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to learn some New Orleans history and taste some fab cocktails. (I especially enjoyed the St. Charles Punch and the Praline Liqueur)."
Food,2.0,OR,"All I can say is just f$&?ing horrible. The guy that answer the phone tells me, I should have told him the time to deliver. Like really! If I could give 0 star I would because giving out 1 star actually is lying to others about this place. My order was put in at 9am & still haven't been delivered yet & it's now 1:54 pm. Just lost a customer due to incompetence."
Food,4.5,OR,"We were hunting for a brewery in the area that opens earlier in the afternoon, and were so glad to find Bold Patriot! Hubby tried a flight of multiple IPAs and I went with their summer shandy. All the beer was really good. We loved sitting in their shaded outdoor space too!

In the same building is a handful of cute local shops, a bakery, restaurants, and more that we really enjoyed strolling through."
Food,3.5,OR,"Fresh Market is a grocery store in South Tampa. They have fresh flowers, fresh organic fruit, fresh bakery, a great selection of gourmet coffee, ready made meals for lunch and dinner, and a wide variety of wine.

If you're short on time for lunch they have fresh made salads, sandwiches, sushi and other hot meals in the deli area. You can also eat your lunch on the tables out in front of the store."
Food,4.5,OR,"This was part of a great day trip for my husband's 40th. We scheduled a private tour. I was hesitant when it was a one-room operation, but Kris was awesome! He right-sized the conversation based on our interests and we walked away with an immense appreciation for him, his craft and his spirits. The cocktails were top notch, the food truck flatbreads were awesome, and ALL of the whiskeys and rums were delicious!"
Food,4.0,OR,Had a nice experience at this location. Had previously only been to the northwest side location. It was a nice place to have a quick meeting with a friend. There was space in the back where we could spread out and work. They also serve light food and snacks at this location. Very nice staff and one of the best places in Tucson to get Boba tea. Taro milk tea is my favorite.
Food,3.5,OR,"Bagel Market Cafe has a great selection of bagels and doughnuts. The have the best Cranberry-Orange bagel I have ever had and offer a selection of fancier bagel sandwiches which I have never tried. Finally their doughnuts are very good an always fresh, if you get there later in the day there may not be much of a selection left as they make what they do in the morning and that is it."
Food,4.5,OR,Went to the Florida Weisse 3rd Anniversary Party yesterday and had a great time! Crazy amount of sours available inside and outside. My favorite was the Strawberry Rhubarb. I also had one that was called Bay Breeze with a variety of fruits. Yumm!! All the staff were friendly and easily identifiable in black tees with their logo. They were also selling tee shirts that they were screenprinting to order right there.
Food,3.5,OR,"Sunny, airy space which I live in coffee shops. Large selection of teas and plenty of seating area. No wifi but there is an Xfinity hot spot. Not many outlets available and it was quite loud when I first went on a Wednesday during the lunch hour. I came again on after brunch on Sunday and it was less busy. Overall cute place to get some work done or catch up with friends!"
Food,5.0,OR,"I ordered a Lemon Huckleberry cake for my daughter's 3rd Birthday and the outcome of the cake was both beautiful and delicious!!! Most importantly the entire cake was covered in buttercream rather than fondant (which I'm not a fan of). Emilee was really accommodating and her emails reply are always prompt too. So for those who wish to have good quality cakes with beautiful artworks, Flour Child is definitely the way to go!!!!!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Stop number 2 on our beer crawl! Some great ones here!

Elliana was great and we had a fun time experimenting with the various beer selections with her!

We tried almost all of them and ended up with crowlers of Hibiscus Blonde, Honey, I Baklavad the Stout, and Watermelon Gose. The Honey Stout was way better than we expected! Honestly didn't have a single one we didn't like. Great spot! Will be back for sure"
Food,3.5,OR,"I'm a wino. I admit it. This is a great winery. Not the best in Bucks County, but definatly worth the trip. I enjoy the pour your own wine sampling. The owner is always there and friendly. He answers questions and suggest food pairings. They have a large selection of fruit wine. I'm not a huge fruit wine fan, but the cranberry wine is hella yummy. Nice variety of reds and whites too."
Food,4.5,OR,"Nice little no-frills, mom/pop, homemade ice cream store, which are harder and harder to find these days. I had a chipwich--the ice cream was  DELICIOUS; the cookie could have been softer, but it still tasted great.  A nice selection of flavors, and the prices are extremely reasonable. This has got to be my new go-to ice cream place.  Please consider putting a few small tables in front of the store."
Food,3.5,OR,"Coming from SoCal, I didn't expect to find a proper Asian Market!  Yay, we have one in Reno...I can stay here!

This is exactly what I am used to, although the prices may be a bit higher.  I was able to find everything I was looking for including Longanisa and Lumpia, which made my day.   

More than likely, if you are looking for Asian Ingredients, they will have you covered."
Food,3.5,CG,"Need to get better beef. 

I'd say I'm not going to be back.Great coffee and great people! I am a coffee snob and have had great coffee and pastries here.

Food,4.5,CG,"What a cool little spot. We had the cinnamon roll which was a nice crunchy doughnut with a nice cinnamon taste. The donuts were good but the donuts were a little overpriced.

Food,4.0,CG,"This place is great! Better than Starbucks, the staff is friendly and they make great drinks! 

The only thing I don't like about this place is the drive thru. There's only one person working the drive thru, which is a bit annoying. But it's not that bad. They're always very quick to make your drink and have the best customer"
Food,1.5,CG,"The water they deliver is always fresh and the food is good. The only thing is that it's a little pricey, but that's okay. The store is clean and well stocked. I think it's a good place to go if you're looking for a place to get some work done."
Food,4.5,CG,"Although not large, this is a place you want to try out. 

The fruit and veggies here are top notch. I am a huge fan of the chicken salad, and it's worth the price. It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it. 

The service is great and they are very helpful and friendly."
Food,3.0,CG,"I had Macaroons, no bake cookies, and the chocolate cookie was a nice touch. I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.

Food,4.0,CG,"Called in a order for a cake and the girl in the bakery said that she would make it. I said I had a cake, and she said that she didn't have it. The girl said that she had to make it, and it was going to be a cake. I said no, and she said I didn't want a cake."
Food,2.5,CG,"This Kroger went through a remodel and the store is pretty much asian as the other one. I had a nice, clean and organized section of food. The prepared foods were pretty good. The prepared foods section was a bit small. I was looking for some Asian items and they were out of them. I found them to be overpriced."
Food,4.0,CG,"This bodega caters more to the local breweries. We love that they have a couple different beer tastings. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is so chill. The only downside is that it's in a tiny strip mall. If you're looking for a good beer with a good vibe, this is the place to go."
Food,4.5,CG,"Wow just wow.  Well, it's the best part of the whole world.  I'm not a big fan of the banana pudding.  The banana pudding is so good, it's worth the calories.  It's a perfect balance between the sweet and savory.  The texture of the banana pudding is perfect and it's a perfect balance between sweet and"
Food,5.0,CG,You know the great Jersey strawberry ice cream with the strawberry ice cream. This is the best strawberry ice cream I have ever had. The ice cream is the best in the city. I'm so excited to see this place open in the near future. This is my favorite brewery in the area and a must visit for anyone visiting the area.
Food,4.0,OR,"Saying they are all the same is not always a bad thing. There are things in life that replicating is all that you can ask for. Insomnia Cookies seems to have this down to a science. This is the 6th or 7th different location I've been to. Like the others, the cookies come out fresh and warm. The gooey chocolate chips melted, literally, as they entered my mouth. It was pure cookie perfection."
Food,4.5,OR,"What a great little spot! They're just starting out but they're putting on it some spectacular beers. They're brewing around 11 beers and try to keep 11 taps on draft. It's a nice spot to have a few pints with friends but all the beers we really liked they were pint only, so that was a downer. But overall a great brewery and I look forward to see what they bring in the future."
Food,3.5,OR,Smoothies are great prices are good . Why 3 starts ?? 1 person working on a sat morning 1 come on smoothie king ?? I was here for 20 min and seen 3 people leave with out buying ?? The one girl was great she was working hard but you really need more people! Please smoothies should be fast. This isn't the first time I've only seen one person but today was pretty bad
Food,3.5,OR,First time this morning to Sprinkle donuts...I've seen a few pop up around town.  Unfortunately even though it's a very cute place I did have a couple complaints.  For the time of morning it was I really think more than one person working the front was necessary.  Got my donuts for work for a special treat for Valentine's Day.. taking my first bite and it just doesn't taste fresh at all.
Food,4.0,OR,"this is a great place to hold mixers, and business meetings, like Your Business Network (YBN), it is local and so far what I have tried there is good, capuchinos, croissants, chai tea, and others are good, the staff is friendly and clean. I like it very much to meet with clients and supporting local business is the way to improve Reno's economy. House wine is good and inexpensive, great venue to host reunions."
Food,3.0,OR,"My family has been going to this location for almost 15+ years. Although it is a meeting spot for many people in Nashville, it fails to ever put strong leadership in this location. It is beyond filthy! All the bagels are always fresh and I enjoy picking them up there, but sitting in this restaurant is absolutely disgusting at all hours of the day not just after a busy lunch."
Food,2.5,OR,"This store is bigger than the Walmart on Columbus. But since it hasn't been renovated recently, the floor space isn't used very efficiently. This is most apparent with the grocery section. The only produce is in bags and the selection is very limited.

One of the upsides to this store is they do have an auto department. But it also has long slow moving lines that seem to be part of every Walmart in Philly."
Food,4.5,OR,"My favorite ice cream place in town. Love the vibes and the friendly staff, and they are always concocting experiments with new flavors. I have pretty simple tastes, and my favorite flavors are banana (with real banana pieces) and date (with real pieces of dates). My wife loves the Elvis Pretzel flavor and the macha green tea flavor. I couldn't recommend Desert Dream enough. Also they have a great Instagram page. Check it out."
Food,4.5,OR,"So happy this was located directly across the street from our hotel, so no Starbucks for us!  Tried Tracy's Addiction, intrigued by the spicy-sweet combo. Could savor the different flavors of cayenne, honey and coconut in layers. Would probably prefer this in an iced version. Husband said his Americano was the best he's had. Cool interior too. Our go-to coffee place for this trip."
Food,4.0,OR,"Are fancy cocktails your thing. do you like drinking out of a cut crystal glass. then this is your ""joint. ""  First I had a simple Tito's and soda, but the glass was such a throwback I thought I was in my grandmother's living room for cocktail hour. Next I tried Just a Peach (something close to that) and it was tasty, a little sweet."
Food,4.0,OR,"This place is pretty cool! It's really big on the inside. Which doesn't look like it from the outside. But they also have seating outside. It's beer only. I prefer liquor or wine.
Street parking on Tchoup.
They have a little food counter that serves up really good food. We had some cheesy balls last time. They were so good. Deep-fried goodness and good dipping sauce.
It's definitely fun though. I would totally check it out again"
Food,3.5,OR,"I have noticed that Thornton usually have good gas prices. All of them are fairly new, which means the pumps usually work properly,....always refreshing.
Inside they are fairly large & usually laid out the same. The level of service is decent. This establishment offers a wide variety of food & drink products, along with a wide variety of many varried items. 
What's a girl to do? Love it when gas pumps are in good condition."
Food,4.5,OR,"Aldi rocks! The prices are cheap. The selection is pretty good. They have increasingly more organic foods. You can't beat the prices on their beer and wine. 

Bring a quarter for the cart. You get the quarter back when you take the cart back. Bring your own bags or buy a couple when you check out. 

If you're looking to save a few bucks without sacrificing quality I would suggest you shop at Aldi."
Food,4.5,OR,"I love this place! They have such a diverse range of teas there really is one for everyone. The price is fair for the amount you get and they have punch cards which I'm a big fan of. My favorite is the lyche green tea but the ice cream black tea is a close second! I also recommend getting half jellies and half boba in your drink, you get a little bit of everything!"
Food,3.0,OR,"Thank you Kelly for taking calls, helping with insurance, explaining how, and why we should take medication, and for smiling when we come to get our prescriptions. CVS Concord Pike is very busy, but they somehow keep you feeling better at the pharmacy. 

I recommend CVS Concord Pike for all your prescription and in store needs. They seem to hire beautiful people all over the store, and Kelly is wonderful with your family's health!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I hate the parking around here, but it's Chinatown, so what am I supposed to expect? Still, Tea Do is well worth the trip! Lots of creative drinks, mixing tea and fruit and boba. My particular favorite is The Hulk! (Green tea, some other stuff, and aloe). I also love their spam onigiri (ask for spicy mayo), but it takes a little wait. Definitely stop by, especially after you have a meal in Chinatown."
Food,4.5,CG,"Looking for shaved ice? Well, it's the best. I'm not sure if I'm just being a little too picky or not.

Not much else to say. 

Thanks again for being the best cupcake shop in St. Louis. You guys are the best cupcake shop in St. Louis. You are the best. 

PS. If you are looking for a good cupcake experience, stop by for a cup"
Food,4.5,CG,This was my friends and I's first time here. I got a cup of the fruit and we loved it.  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I would definitely go again.  It was a little pricey for a cup but I think it was worth it.  They have a nice variety of flavors and I can't wait to try some more

I'll definitely be back to"
Food,3.5,CG,"With the COVID-19 pandemic spreading, it's an easy and convenient location.

The staff is always friendly and the drinks are always made right. The drinks are always made quickly and made right. They also have a rewards program which is always a plus. I always get the same drink with no problems.

One thing I've noticed about this location"
Food,4.0,CG,"Just went last night and it was the worst experience. I will not be going back. If you go to this location, you will not be able to shop there. The employees are rude and do not care about their jobs. I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I got a vanilla latte, which was very good."

We will definitely be back!Delicious coffee and"
Food,3.5,OR,"Great place to hang out. Grab a beer or 2 and then have some appies and chill for a bit. Once you and your friends have eaten and drank then buy some tokens and play some games. Let me tell you something. They have most of the ""old"" games such as Pac Man, race cars, street fighters and much much more. It is located right on Whyte ave so there is tons to do afterwards."
Food,4.5,OR,"The beer is ok, decent enough. The staff is consistently insufferable, rude, pretentious and uninviting. This seems to be a company wide culture they've adopted because the Reno and Sparks locations are both like this. Perhaps there's a sign on my forehead that says ""this guy is a jerk"" because I rarely get served, the only thing plentiful here is plenty of attitude. Strange, because no other brewery in town treats their customers like this."
Food,4.5,OR,"This was the least charming of the three locations I tried (yes I visited three in as many days ... because... wow) 

You can't go wrong though, I got there at the end of business in the way out of town, I threw the car against the curb illegally and raced in, then raced out as my gf ordered-  ahhhh. 
Nothing like a night cap and incredible ice cream to say goodbye to Nashville."
Food,2.5,OR,We have never had any problems at this Dunkin.  It's always fast whether you go in or use the drive thru.  I have been going to this location more often since I have been working from home due to the Covid mess and due to having errands further down Baltimore Pike.  This is still a fairly new store and it remains bright and clean and airy and seems to be well managed.
Food,4.5,OR,"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had. I have never met the rudest person in my entire life. My friends and I were happy to spend a ton of money on alcohol and I'm so sad this was my experience. The sales person is so excruciatingly rude, I have no word to even describe more. If you are ever in Nashville please please please do not go to this store."
Food,4.0,OR,"Love this place, especially the new location. We've been using them for 4+ years for all of our special occasion cakes and have had so many people ask us about the cake designs and where we get them from and more than happy to tell them. Can't say enough about their creativity and ability to take a conceptual design and make it into a cake. Who needs the Cake Boss when we have Celebrating Life?"
Food,4.0,OR,"I had to hit the grand opening today because why wouldn't I?? 
This place was like a well oiled machine. Tons of super cool people directing traffic, giving tips on orders, and just having fun. They took my order on a tablet and I had it super quick. I tried the annihilator and it was fabulous!  
Dutch Bros has me reconsidering my very exclusive relationship with the corporate monster down the street."
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is awesome! The inside is so adorable. They have different board games on each table which I thought was a cool touch. They offer so many unique different styles of cones to pick from. You can also have ice cream or gelato. I got a cone that had cotton candy around it, with gelato and it was $7!!! That's it! Was super delicious. The girl working was also very friendly."
Food,4.0,OR,Walked over here after dinner to grab dessert. Cute set up with lots of unique yummy flavors. The line was a little long and it wouldn't have been too bad if their AC was working. It was hotter than outside in there. Surprise the ice cream wasn't melting. The mango and rainbow sorbet was nice and refreshing. I would recommend this place and would come back if I come back to this part of Florida.
Food,4.5,OR,"Yummy muffins, good coffee. But, the real stand out at this family cafe is the customer service!

The owner gave me a business card and told me that (since I have a young baby,) I should call ahead next time. He will bring the coffee out my car so I don't have to get the baby out of the car seat.

Music to mama's ears!  I will definitely be back & highly recommend this coffee shop!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"When you can choose your beverage, amazing cheeses and then leave it to the plating people to add olives, cornichons, candied pecans and chutneys. this is the place!  Combine an atmosphere of ""find a table midst the like minded appreciative souls"", music and your drink of choice and let the happiness commence!  You can extend the amazement with great starters such as more olives, a trio of butters, salads and entrees."
Food,3.5,OR,"So, I remember when TCBY used to be at this location.

When walking inside Frazzberry, there is amble seating. It's all self-serve; walk towards the back, get a cup (all the same size) and go down the line of frozen options. This place charges by the weight. So of course you are going to pay more with loading it with toppings. 

The girl working there was friendly enough and the ice cream/non-ice cream wasn't that bad."
Food,2.0,OR,"Never, ever again.  You try going in with someone on the spectrum who has her heart set on a donut. Then watch as the people on front of you (with two hyperactive children playing tag in the store) buy up 3 doz donuts 
All my kid kept saying was there they go their buying up all the donuts!!
I asked when we got to the front-hoping! No, it will take 48hrs to make more-sorry.
We left."
Food,4.0,OR,"Haven't attended an event here, just stopped in to check it out. Such a gorgeous place. The two staff members we encountered were friendly and personable, and one of them assisted in our wine tasting. She helped us find the perfect one, though all were delicious. I discovered a new favorite, the Ison, and I'm dying to get back over there to pick up another bottle! The most complex I've tasted since getting into wine."
Food,3.0,OR,"Stay away from this place. Worst customer service in this side of Santa Barbara. This is the third time I go there and they take there sweet time, talking and singing - the staff , while there's customers in line waiting to pay or order. Mexican bread is good but if you think about going there for a quick run, forget about it, you might be there for a long time! Never going there again!"
Food,5.0,CG,5/5! Great coffee. The caffeine here is strong and the ambiance is nice. The barista was very nice and the drinks were great. Will definitely be back.I'm a fan of this place. I love the flavors and the service. I wish I could get some of their other flavors every time. I have tried the banana and blueberry flavors and they
Food,4.0,CG,"I went to this location on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty empty, but the staff were very nice and the drinks were great. I also ordered the Taro milk tea and it was pretty good. It's in a very cool location near the mall and is a great place to visit if you're in the area.They are always busy but the service is always so quick"
Food,2.5,CG,"So, have you been to a Starbucks, let me just say that I am not a Starbucks person. I had a friend from out of town, and I had a cold brew that I had had to try. I am from Seattle, and I always wanted to try new things and a new place to go to. I had to try it."
Food,3.5,CG,"Flying from Jamaica (Montego Bay) and an island with a lot of history.

The tour is free. There's a lot of history. You get to taste the different kinds of teas. They offer a few different types of teas. If you're looking for something different, you can get a tea with your tea. I got the honey berry"
Food,4.0,CG,Jamie and crew are awesome. From what I saw they were very knowledgeable about wine and cheese. The owner and staff are amazing. I would recommend you try this place out!The best customer service in the world. I am from Seattle and I come to Starbucks often. The baristas are always friendly and quick to make recommendations.
Food,4.5,CG,Came by the other day and it was the best part of our trip! The guy working the front desk was super friendly and helpful. We took him around and shared a great conversation about the place and the history of the place. We will be back!I always like to come here when I'm in the area. I go here almost every weekend and it is a great
Food,3.5,CG,If I could give zero stars I would. I love this place! I just moved here from Los Angeles and I am so glad I have a local place to get coffee. I came here on a Saturday morning and it was absolutely packed. I got a large iced chai latte and my boyfriend got a cappuccino and both were excellent.
Food,4.5,CG,Small neighborhood ice cream shop. We had the almond crunch and the chocolate chip cookie. I was not impressed. The ice cream was very soft and creamy and the flavor was not too strong. The only thing I didn't like was the scoop size. I would say this is a good size for a small. I liked the consistency of the ice cream. The only issue was the
Food,4.5,CG,Definitely one of the staples here. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever meet. They are rude and will not help you. They are rude and refuse to help you. I don't know how they can be so rude. They are rude and I'm so

Food,4.5,CG,"My favorite place in Delaware! We have been going here for years and always make it a point to stop here before we leave the house. Their ice cream is amazing, the place is clean and the staff is friendly. Definitely a must visit for anyone visiting the area!It was a lot of fun to watch the line go by and get a free beer after having some beers."
Food,4.0,CG,Ridley Water Ice is a nice place to go if you're in the area. I was just in town visiting and had to stop by before dinner and the ice cream was great. The line was long and it was a good size. The shop is small and is kinda small but not crowded. They have a nice variety of flavors and toppings.
Food,3.5,CG,"Retro, walk-up frozen custard shop, and you'll find it here.

***************************************

Near perfect EXCEPT for sanitation of the straws. Please switch to straws that come individually wrapped!! I don't want my barista touching my straws with their BARE hands. I literally witnessed one gentlemen touch his eyebrows and did not see him wash his hands afterwards. That same hand will be used to pick up straws for the next drink. On a positive note, he was very nice and answered any questions that I had."
Food,2.5,OR,"Target, there's not much bad to say about this business in my eyes. Clean (to include the restrooms)organized, helpful staff, relatively inexpensive prices, well stocked, modern and up to date, and they even have a Starbucks inside. I have to give a shout out to Juan, who is there in the mornings to help me with my coffee. He always calls me by name and serves exactly what I all with a smile on his face."
Food,4.0,OR,"I seriously love how friendly the staff is and I am absolutely in love with the Jittery Javelina! I once read a review that Crave Coffee had the smoothest coffee. I think whomever wrote that needs to try Roadrunner Coffee, because I've tried Crave and I can barely taste the coffee. With Roadrunner I can taste the coffee, but it's not overpowering and it's perfectly blended and roasted. 

I do definitely recommend and love this place!"
Food,4.5,OR,Me and my girls went here after working a long day for the bucs ! We definitely created a little party of the ice cream bar area. Felt a little something off the alcohol percentage. The ice cream was very smooth and tasteyy. You can get pints to go. It's a nice little spot to check out while at the hard rock especially if the sugar factory is ridiculous and won't let you get a table.
Food,4.5,OR,"Went there for the comedy show Saturday.   Show was great.   I don't drink beer so couldn't tell you about the beer other then they were slinging a lot of it.  They would have sold a lot more if they had staff working the floor during the show.  we had to go to the bar.   

Great place with Great atmosphere.  We will be back for the next show."
Food,4.0,OR,"This place has a very nice ambience and it primarily caters to UofA students. Compared to the other joints near campus, this is by far the nicest one and has a lot more selection on their menu. I ordered a cup of café latte and it was way too bitter for my taste. They need to add more milk to make it smoother.  Great place to bring your tablet or laptop with headphones while working."
Food,3.0,OR,"Today I sampled some treats a family member brought home. Peanut butter cup cupcake, Nutella cupcake, lobster tail and a chocolate cream puff.  Everything was delicious. The cupcakes were rich & moist and the frostings were light yet flavorful. The lobster tail was filled with a not  too sweet cream and had a crispy shell. The cream puff was nice and light with a flavorful chocolate filling. I would definitely try it again myself."
Food,3.0,OR,"This was a cute shop but very over priced. The staff is friendly and the shop is clean. 

My husband and I bought 3 desserts that all averaged  around $5 each. There are too many good bakeries around to pay $2 extra on a dessert.  

Final thought if I was in the shopping center and wanted a treat to go with my Starbucks,  I would go back but wouldn't make a special trip."
Food,3.0,OR,"This was one of the cleanest Racetracs we've been to.  The restrooms looked brand new.  They also had very clean pumps.  If you want E88 gas, you can get it at this station.  There was plenty of help inside at the registers.  There is slot of pumps so no wait in any line to get your fill up.  Prices were just like anywhere else, $2.059 a gallon for regular unleaded."
Food,5.0,OR,"Our wine tour was supposed to be 5 hours but lasted 8! They had us visiting a miniature house farm, getting a tour of Santa Barbara and surrounding areas, a strawberry stand, cupcake store (that matched wine with their flavors!) an olive oil and balsamic vinegar tasting, a fantastic organic picnic lunch, and a great mix of larger and smaller wineries picked from our suggestions and likes. The tour was the highlight of our entire trip!"
Food,4.5,OR,"In my various quests for Korean foods, I've generally had the best luck at Sandyi. Occasionally they even have items I can't find elsewhere in town. For Tucson, they're a five-star business; the only reason I gave them four stars is that I've been spoiled by Korean markets in places like Ellicott City, Maryland, where it's like walking into a wormhole and ending up in Korea itself. They also have reasonable prices and are always friendly."
Food,4.5,OR,"Don't be deterred from the line. There's always a line in the summer or whenever it's warm out, and it usually wraps around the building. Stick with it - you'll be in line maybe 10-15 minutes. They know how to handle demand.

My go-to is graham central station - a rich and complex flavor and texture combination. The single scoop is plenty for me to satisfy my sweet tooth.

Great spot for ice cream any time of year."
Food,3.5,OR,"Thank goodness for Needler's! While living downtown, it was often our saving grace for quick ingredients that we had forgotten on our last big grocery trips. The drink selection is awesome and although it is a smaller grocery, they do have all of the essentials. They also have a balloon/helium window, which I used for work a few times. While I often had to wait for that or wait to check-out, it is a helpful spot."
Food,4.5,CG,"LOVE THIS PLACE. Shane, the owner, is an absolute genius.

Food,4.5,CG,I will agree with another reviewer who said the ice cream is creamy and delicious. I was just in a rush and had to get a table to get around and watch the line. The line was a little long and we got a couple of ice cream. I got the vanilla and the chocolate and a chocolate chip cookie. I did get a medium and the chocolate cookie was so good.
Food,4.5,CG,"This place is fantastic. The ice cream is amazing and you can't go wrong with the fruit toppings. If you want to try a flavor that is different than what you normally get, this place is a great place to go.I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I got the strawberry smoothie which was great and had a nice smooth finish"
Food,2.5,CG,"The photo department at this location has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I have ordered cakes for two different occasions and the cake was delivered by the wrong person.

I have never had an issue with this store"

The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the"
Food,4.5,CG,Just stopped by to pick up a few items and decided to purchase a bottle of the wine and we were so impressed. The staff was very friendly and the wines were delicious. I will definitely be going back to this location. I will definitely be back!I always like to try new products and a new place to shop!  I love the fact that they have a great selection of
Food,4.5,CG,"Naga tea used to be a staple, but now they're all watered down. I'm pretty sure that's not the case. The milk tea is okay, but the boba is sooo powdery and not overly sweet. 

I'd come back to try their other drinks and hang out here again. I'd also suggest getting a boba tea with boba"
Food,4.0,CG,"Reasonable prices, good food, attentive staff. The only downside is that it's close to the park, but I guess it's a nice place to shop. The only downside to this store is that it's a little smaller than the other local grocery stores.This was our first time in Santa Barbara and we were so excited to try it. The ice cream was great and the"
Food,4.0,OR,"The place is nice and fun, but they need to do something about the bartenders! We went on a Friday night and they didn't have more than 5 people in the place, unfortunately the bartender acted as if we were bothering him by ordering a beer! I really hope that the duffy's talk to their employees about customer service bc they will end up with less than the 5 people that were there on a Friday night!"
Food,4.5,OR,"100% worth the long lines! I got the salted caramel flavor this time, but I also like the honey lavender (my all-time favorite!), milk & cookies, and malted milk ball. 

I loved the creamy texture of the ice cream and how rich the caramel flavor was. I got a small scoop, and it doesn't look that big, but it was honestly so much ice cream. Would recommend splitting with a friend if you're like me haha :)"
Food,4.0,OR,"The newly remodeled Kroger is nice and bright. It's taking some getting used to the new layout, but I've eventually found what I am looking for. I also like the 2 self check out areas. I can quickly park, grab my scrips, and a few items and be in and out. 
I like all the new food options that come in handy for lunch and dinner. I work across the street and like popping over for lunch."
Food,3.5,OR,"This place is great for healthy and organic selections.  The only negatives are the location (middle of nowhere), cashier lines are long and not a lot of meat selections.  I will still make the drive out here because the food is fresh, great parking and small manageable store (not like Kroger). It is on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for. I would say somewhere between Whole Foods and Trader Joe's."
Food,3.5,OR,"The only reason I'm giving this Starbucks a 2 is because the drive thru people are amazing and they never make my drink wrong at drive thru. BUT I have went inside a total of 4 times and without fail EVERY TIME they have made my drink wrong and forgotten to put vanilla syrup in the Americano.

Thank heaven for mobile ordering and the fact that now I just get coffee from other locations instead of this one."
Food,3.5,OR,"I love this Starbucks! Before I moved, I used to run through drive thru before work. Now I just stop by during my lunch break. 

The staff is always friendly and the service is super speedy, which is much appreciated since I'm always running a little late!

The interior space is great for hanging out reading or working and is quiet enough for a quick meeting. They also have a few tables outside for when it's beautiful out."
Food,2.0,OR,"If I could give zero stars I would. Went in to the nail salon for a polish change. Gel on fingers, polish on toes. I asked if they could help me find a matching tone. ""BB"" picked out one shade that did not match and then walked away..... The other worker said that she told her to let me pick when I specifically asked her to help me. Ended up going somewhere else. Worst customer service ever."
Food,3.5,OR,"This is my absolute favorite Publix and it's the one closest to my home. It has just about everything I need there and I think they're prices are pretty great also. Publix is a good competitor and if you are watching, you shop on their BOGO days and you can really save a LOT of money. Just need to get there before all their products are gone because everyone else shops for deals on those days also."
Food,4.0,OR,"I've been kinda not sure of the location in 22nd and Alvernon. But today I went and the girl who cashiers saw I was a little down and asked what was wrong. I didn't go into detail with her however she did cheer me up. She gave me my drink on the house and a note in the top of my drink. It was so sweet! 
Sometimes little things like that can make all the difference."
Food,4.5,OR,"Ohhhhhh my goodness. I wish I could pack up this place and bring it home with me. It's the perfect environment for setting up shop and getting some work done or meeting up with a friend to chat. So, so chill. And the coffee is amazing of course! Best iced mocha I have had in a while. Another cool thing is they offer half off your first drink when you check in on yelp."
Food,4.5,OR,"The buns and desserts here are good. Come on in, get a tray, a pair of tongs, and pick whatever you like. I recommend the fried shrimp dumplings -- savory, but probably more calories than you'd think. Go over to the cake slices and get some pandan cakes -- fluffy and a nice layer of whipped cream. I always get some cold milk tea. Cash only, but you can get a lot with a couple of dollars."
Food,4.5,OR,"Honestly, I'm not sure how they're still in business. Quite frankly the worst carrot cake I've ever had in my life. It actually turned me off to eating my own birthday cake. Dry, bland, terrible icing. I guess you do not go to an Italian bakery for a carrot cake and you do not get a carrot cake for a birthday cake. I've never had a cake I actually hated before... but this was honestly awful/ stale."
Food,4.5,CG,"The gelato is great, service is fast and the ice cream is creamy. Definitely a must go if you're in the area!I am a huge fan of Treme Donuts. This place is a great little place in the heart of St. Louis. This is a great place for a quick bite before or after a date. I love the fact that they have a punch card"
Food,4.5,CG,"Remember when you could still go to the market and try all the fresh produce, the fruit and veggies here are top notch. I am a huge fan of the chicken salad, it's so good and so fresh. I love how fresh they are. This is my new go to for the organic produce. I have also tried the vegetarian meat and chicken salad. I haven't had anything but"
Food,2.0,CG,I was traveling through town and needed some coffee and decided to stop by this place. I ordered the coffee and it was delicious. The barista was very nice and the place was clean. I will definitely be back. I'm a coffee snob. This is my first time at this location. I ordered a medium latte and a medium mocha with a vanilla bean.
Food,4.5,CG,A fun place to go and have some drinks and try something new. There is a large patio and a small patio. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is so chill.I'm so excited to see this place open in the neighborhood. I love the selection of craft beers and the people working there are so friendly and helpful. I can't wait to come back and try more of
Food,4.0,CG,The donuts are inexpensive and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and she said no.  I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.
Food,5.0,CG,Stopped in here after wasting time on the weekend and decided to try it out. I was pretty disappointed. The ice cream is very thick and creamy but the flavor was not great. The flavors were not well blended and the ice cream was very thick. My boyfriend got the vanilla bean and said it was too sweet for him to drink. The ice cream was not very creamy and had a
Food,5.0,CG,"Service was welcoming and I had an amazing time! We will definitely be back for sure!I am a huge fan of the bakery, but this is the closest one to my house and I go there everyday. It's a little pricey for what it is and for the quality of the products. They have a nice selection of pastries, but I think it is a little overpriced."
Food,4.5,CG,"This place is amazing we go here everyday. Great prices and great people!We have been wanting to go to this place for awhile, but since we have a couple friends who live in LA we have had no luck in staying in NOLA. This place is so cute and cozy. We love their coffee and their pastries. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great."
Food,4.5,CG,"First time here, was referred to by the bartender as a ""hand crafted"" person. He said he wasn't too into the beer, but he is a very nice guy who is a brewer. He had a great personality and a great personality. He is very friendly and gives you the opportunity to sample before purchasing. I will definitely be back.I ordered a cake for my husband's"
Food,4.5,CG,"I'm a serious homebrewer and this place is the best. I'm not a huge fan of breweries. I've had the IPA's, IPA's, pale ales, and stout's. All were great. The flight is $6 for a pint. This is a great way to spend an afternoon. I'm also a fan of the fact that the pours are so light"
Food,3.5,CG,The beer is great especially the Cigar City IPA. I also love that they have a couple different flavors so you can try different beers before you get the full experience. The staff is always friendly and helpful. It's a great place to hang out. This is a great place to visit if you're in the area!They are always out of items on their shelves.
Food,4.0,CG,"I'm not too sure about this place, but it is a great place for a variety of cupcakes. The staff is always friendly and helpful, the shop is clean, and the cakes are always beautiful. I've been a loyal customer for many years and I always enjoy the treats and treats. I love the fact that they are open until 11pm everyday."
Food,4.5,OR,"My husband and I shared a flight of 6 when we visited Bywater. We opted for the non-sour beers. Wow! They were all amazing. My favorite is as the hazy IPA. My husband is not a fan of dark beer but he loved their dark beer (I can't remember the name). It truly was very smooth. They have an outside patio with shade, in case you happen to go on a rainy day. They are also dog friendly."
Food,2.5,OR,"usually don't buy prepared food, but one day was too hungry and bought some fried chicken from this Albertson location, my god I've been sick for a whole week with an a stomach flu like diarrhea and nausea.
I should've trusted my intuition this one didn't look like is very clean.
After reading comments by the Business, as she directed me I went to their website fir that location, there is no chat area or contact us area to consider."
Food,4.0,OR,"I am not sure why I had such a bad experience compared to other reviewers. Our drinks took 15 minutes to make even though there weren't that many customers. Our drinks were nothing special. My taro smoothie was so ridiculously sweet, I think I developed a cavity. My friend was not a fan of her drink either. Maybe we just walked in on an off day. If I'm in the area I will give this place another try."
Food,4.0,OR,This is a really cool little place to go and hang out with some friends. I'm giving it four stars because I would like it to have more plants and flowers to make it more botanical looking. The drinks were interesting tasting I had the my little pony with hibiscus flavoring I recommend getting extra flavor since it is so strong and bitter unless you like your tea like that but overall it was a very nice experience
Food,4.5,OR,"We went with friends on their recommendation for cocktails. Very comfortable, casual setting! Most of the patrons that evening where considerably younger than us fifty somethings , but still nice for a place to meet up with friends for a couple of drinks. Amazing locally distilled liquors! The cocktails averaged about $12 per drink so you could easily spend 60-80 if you relaxed and having fun. They also serve a few munchies and is a pet friendly establishment."
Food,3.5,OR,"I am a local.  Very disinterested staff. The Check out system is not user friendly.  Last time, yesterday,  there I was charged twice for one bottle. The clerk was gone before I could review my receipt. Another Person apologized and made correction.

I will not go back. I like being treated like a valued customer.  There are other choices, I suggest making one.   I gave it two stars on  selections.
Not on price."
Food,2.0,OR,"This location didn't participate in the 2 Wake-up Wraps for $2 promotion.  I also had placed the On-the-Go order 3.5 minutes before walking in to the store, & neither employee had worked on it yet, despite there not being any customers in line (1 employee was texting, the other was sweeping the floors).  Once they started working on my order, the wrap had the wrong cheese on it.  No big deal, but quite disappointing nonetheless."
Food,2.0,OR,"Awful customer service. Site-to-store is a joke- they messed up my order and didn't care at all about forcing me to sign for something i did NOT order. Severely understaffed and those that work are slow as molasses- waited in line to return my INCORRECT site-to-store order for 19 minutes. Not an exaggeration. 

Wrote an email to corporate about the situation and did not hear back, customer service overall is a joke. I'll stick to target for everything."
Food,4.0,OR,"This spot is so cute! The staff is super friendly and the handmade treats are bomb! I ordered a slice of cardamom/espresso cake and an oatmeal cookie sandwich with vanilla cream - both delicious! There's also an adorable outdoor seating area. There's only 3 tables, but guests are in and out fast for quick bites and sips. So if you're patient, you can grab a seat! This café is truly a neighborhood gem and I will definitely return!"
Food,5.0,OR,"An adorable and delicious addition to Glenside! I have been lucky to enjoy Carminati Creamery's gelato over the last few years at The Primex Winter Market and From the Boot in Ambler. I am thrilled for Darin and Amy to have their very own location. You really cannot go wrong with any flavor, however their Vanilla Gelato with Strawberry Sorbet is an amazing combination. I can't wait to go again later his week:) best of success you guys!!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I've been here twice and I've thoroughly enjoyed it both times.  I think the beer here is really great.  The food is pretty good, but this place brings the atmosphere.  I think I would take a night here over almost any other place in Phoenixville.

The waitstaff has always been excellent and if you have an opportunity to hang out in the beer garden at any point in the day, I highly recommend you do that!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I've been a couple of times and have felt the effects of their learning curve. When the theater is full the kitchen can't handle all the food orders and there's a delay. The menu is bar food basically. And they have domestic beers. I've had the pizza-it's as good as a frozen one and had the CA chicken sandwich-its good every time. The concept is good and the staff really tries, which makes up for the little snags."
Food,3.0,CG,"Pretty standard donuts, with a few flavors, and the prices are pretty fair. The variety of toppings is pretty good, and the staff is friendly and helpful. There are a lot of flavors to choose from, and the workers are always very helpful. This is a great place to get a donut before or after a date. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a"
Food,4.5,CG,"What can I say about this place?  It is a little on the pricier side, but the quality of the food is great.  The salad bar is pretty good, and the seafood is good.  The sushi is fresh, and the frozen section is excellent.  The only downside is that it's close to the park, but I do think it's a great place to get"
Food,3.0,CG,Basically very much the same.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude.  I am a regular and have never been treated so poorly.  I have had to call in a prescription for a prescription for a reason and they never had it ready.  I will never go to this location again.I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and
Food,4.5,CG,I really love the teas here. The fruit teas are smooth and delicious. I have yet to find a bad flavor. I am a huge fan of the jasmine tea and the fruit teas are so good. I am a huge fan of their milk teas. The texture of the tea is so smooth and refreshing. I can't wait to come back and try more of
Food,3.5,CG,"After hearing both good and bad reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I was pretty disappointed. The donuts are good but the service is terrible. I ordered a regular vanilla glazed and a vanilla glazed. The donuts were good but the donuts were not fresh. I ended up going to Dunkin Donuts and getting a bag of donuts."
Food,4.0,CG,"I live in the neighborhood, and have been going to this Walmart since they opened. I go every day. There's always a line, but they're quick and friendly. The only thing that I do wish they had was a little more variety. I love how they have a variety of products and a decent selection of things to choose from. 

They also have a great variety of"
Food,2.0,CG,This target is horrible. I go to the one on Virginia and it's always a mess. The staff is so rude. The store is always filthy and the shelves are empty. I go to the one on Virginia and get a large carton of whatever I need to buy. The staff is always extremely rude and incompetent. I go to Target and have never had an issue with anything.
Food,1.5,CG,"It's ""OK"".  I usually go to the Reading Terminal Market for a cup of coffee, but the pastries are not the best.  There's no wonder why the place is closed.  If it was still open, I would have given it two stars.  But the last time I went, I was just amazed at how disappointed I was.  If I lived in Philly"
Food,2.5,CG,The Kroger customer service is lacking. The employees are friendly and helpful. There is a large selection of other items.  The store is clean and well-stocked. The store is well-stocked and the store is well-stocked.I love this place. The staff is always friendly and the ice cream is delicious. I had the blueberry sorbet and it was delicious
Food,3.0,CG,No more taking slow Septaors. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star is because the two employees working there are not helpful and don't seem to care about their customers.The customer service is excellent. The staff is extremely friendly. My husband and I ordered a chai and a cappuccino and both were fantastic. The atmosphere was very relaxed and had great music
Food,5.0,CG,"I can't believe how incredibly rude this store is!  I will never shop at this store again. I've had the best experience of a year with the manager, Jenny, and she's always so friendly and helpful. I've been coming here for years and it always seems to be clean. I have also noticed that they are very helpful and friendly."
Food,4.5,CG,Dear Lord. Heaven is on earth. I go here at least once a week. There is a decent amount of space and the people are always so nice and polite. There are a lot of nice restaurants and bars in the area. I love the beer garden. You can always get a growler filled to go.
Food,4.5,OR,Wow wow wow. This place is amazing. Fresh ingredients and amazing flavors. The flavors are one of a kind! I don't live very close but I will take that drive and come get me some weckerlys. My boyfriend doesn't handle dairy well but he never has a problem eating weckerlys. It's pretty crazy lol. Do yourself a favor and take the drive here. You won't regret it. Oh they also have amazing ice cream sandwiches. I want them all.
Food,2.5,OR,"This is my favorite Walmart. I feel it's clean and well organized. I purchase clothing, shoes etc for my kids and I love the deals that I find. For example, I just got two pairs of really awesome, expensive looking shoes for my son and they were on clearance! I paid $22 for two pairs of shoes, this is just unheard of. I also think their customer service is great here and they have staff always willing to help."
Food,1.5,OR,Went to this location before my 6am shift. Store is closed. employees are in there. they wouldn't come to the door. People were pulling up for case. No gas attendant. someone finally unlocks door to let the gas attenda out at 5:40am. the manager. I'm assuming lock the doors real quick. there was a man standing at the door the manager just waved at him as if to say we're closed. No explanation. I hate this location.
Food,4.0,OR,"When you're looking for the antithesis of Starbucks this is your place.  The coffee is obviously local (roasted in the building) and its as casual an environment as you'll find.  The patio is strewn with random furniture and the building has a non-functioning garage door with a window for great light.  

Its tucked away on a quiet street and is the most relaxed place to have a great cup of coffee.  This place os great."
Food,4.0,OR,"When visiting Reading (RED-ing) Terminal Market, there are two must-haves: DiNic's roast pork sandwich and Bassetts' ice cream.

There is one word to describe ice cream perfection... Bassetts. With traditional flavors and unique creadtions, you will find over 40 flavors on the menu and you can't go wrong with any selection. My top three favorite flavors are the following, in order:
1. Raspberry Truffle
2. Mint Chocolate Chip
3. Gadzooks!

So good your tongue has to pinch itself to make sure it's not dreaming."
Food,2.5,OR,"Stopped in to this place as I was in the neighborhood and just had a really unpleasant experience. First off they couldn't accept debit or charge cards. Then the order I placed was nothing like the photo or description of the item I ordered. Last, the person working was completely unpleasant and basically rude. 

Don't go there. Ever. There are too many good places for ice cream or frozen custard in STL to waste your time and money here."
Food,4.5,OR,"Extremely friendly staff that hosts tours/wine tastings for a local winery. While I am not the biggest wine expert and think some of the wines are a bit too sweet for me, this place offers a variety of options and make every effort to please all tastes. The gift shop offers a variety of Florida themed souvenirs/gifts along with all the wines available. This place is definitely worth visiting and place I'll be going for gifts come holiday season."
Food,4.5,OR,"This place has a great local vibe. Reminds me of The Globe, which left a vacuum here in the 'burg. Good selection of funky espresso drinks and their own locally roasted coffee leaves nothing to be desired. Staff are friendly and efficient. Local art is available for purchase and local goings on are posted on the wall adjacent to the coffee bar as well. Black Crow Coffee is a great representation of the true local flavor of St. Pete."
Food,4.5,OR,"We always buy our milk here.  We like that they have high quality milk and feel that it is important that their farmers treat the cows with respect.  Every once in awhile we will get their ice cream and enjoy it, but I would rather make my own ice cream using their whole cream.  You can often find samples while picking up milk and it is handy to have a drive through to grab and run."
Food,3.0,OR,"I come to this Starbucks pretty often and 3/5 times I get great service. But this most recent time I ordered a strawberry acai with lemonade and received ice with a little bit of my drink. I asked the barista if they could make it with light ice, and not only did I get a bit of an annoyed face, but the second drink I got had just as much ice. Was not very happy after that visit :/"
Food,4.0,OR,"A relatively large market just South of downtown Edmonton, Old Strathcona Farmer's Market is a great place to shop for Organic seasonal produce and locally-raised meats, at least one-hundred vendors and several-fold more patrons packing the place on Saturdays with bakers, crafters and more also accounted for.  Stop in for everything from a cup of Coffee and live music plus Doughnuts from Moonshine to Duck Breast and locally made Pickles ready to be part of the night's feast."
Food,4.0,OR,"Being able to experience Cafe Du Monde is a privilege. You're surrounded by beautiful French architecture in the French quarter. Do not be intimidated by the long line. We came by after lunch and only waited for 20 mins before we sat down. Of course the beignets are a must order, for coffee you have to get the cafe au lait. Life is perfection once your order arrives and you take the first morsel in the warm sweet goodness!!"
Food,3.5,CG,"Breaux Mart will always be a staple of our family. I will continue to drive the extra mile to get my weekly groceries. I am a huge fan of the Maple Bacon, and it's amazing. I can't wait to try the other things. This was our first time in Santa Barbara and we were so excited to try it. The ice cream was great and the service was great."
Food,4.0,CG,Kim Brothers is a fantastic find. The quality of their product is consistent and the variety of flavors is a great range. The staff is always friendly and the store is clean. I love that it's within walking distance of my house.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me and I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional for my
Food,4.5,CG,I stopped by here for some ice cream after dinner. I got a cup of the pistachio (which was very good) and a pint of the praline. The ice cream was pretty good. The praline was a little on the dry side and had a strange after taste. I don't think I'll be back.I had a horrible experience with the pharmacy staff at this Walg
Food,3.5,CG,"The reason for my negative review is because the ice cream was cold. There were about 4 flavors to choose from. The banana, strawberry and peach were both tasty. The waffle cone was a little hard to eat, so it was a little hard to chew. They had a lot of unique flavors to choose from. There was a lot of ice cream flavors."
Food,2.0,CG,We ordered an ice coffee and an iced coffee. I chose a simple latte and the barista said it was the best latte I have ever had. I was very impressed with the customer service and the quality of the coffee. I will definitely be back to try their other treats.Great coffee and service. I had the Cuban and it was great. I wish I could take a picture
Food,4.0,CG,i had heard a lot about it and thought it was good. The fruit and veggies were so fresh and delicious. The egg and cheese salad was tasty. The cheese was so fresh and had great flavor. I can't wait to come back and try other items. They also sell a variety of pastries. They also sell cookies and pastries.
Food,3.5,CG,"I legit come here many times a week. It's a great place for a variety of flavors. I always get the waffle cone. The staff is always friendly and helpful.I'm so excited to have found this place in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe. I love the vintage chairs and the old school decor. 

I love the decor and the music is always"
Food,3.0,CG,"So very disappointed. First of all, the coffee is just ok. Not my favorite, but the pastries are fine. The people behind the counter are the most friendly and helpful. The place is small and there are a few tables outside. There are also plenty of tables outside. The only downside is that it's close to the park, but I hope it gets better as time goes on."
Food,4.5,CG,"I was seeking out Phyllodelphia, and I was very pleased with the first stop. I was greeted by a very friendly woman named Melissa, who took the time to explain the different flavors and helped me make my decision. She even gave me a sample of the gelato to try. The gelato was very good, and the flavor of the gelato was on point."
Food,2.5,CG,I went to get COVID-19 vaccine. The employee who helped me was very kind and the person who helped me was very helpful. I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here! I love the name and the taste! I also love the fact that they are open until 10am
Food,4.5,CG,Def a great vibe for a place that has a lot of history. There is a lot of seating and a small bar area. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The food was great. The cocktails were great. The beer was good. I would come back to try some of the other drinks.A nice place to go if you are in the area. There is a great selection of liquor
Food,3.5,CG,"Best prices and selection around!!! Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. My favorite is the yellow bean one. I've had the best donuts at the grocery store ever, and it's pretty much the best donut I've ever had. The shop is huge and clean. There's also a huge selection of donuts to choose from, including glazed and maple glazed."
Food,4.5,CG,"Happy Donut Day 2021!!!! 
I had an iced coffee and a cold brew with oat milk and a couple of extra shots of espresso.   The coffee was tasty and the atmosphere was nice.  
I will be back to this Starbucks for coffee and to try some of their other treats.  
One last thing I noticed about this place was that the decor is"
Food,4.0,CG,Tried Tea do for the first time and was very pleased with it. The tea was strong and the atmosphere was great. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I would definitely go again.The best in town.  The shop is beautiful and clean.  The staff is always friendly.  They have the most delicious desserts and treats.  I think they have the best selection
Food,2.5,OR,"This place use to have such nice employees, but now all they have are people who don't want to work there and it shows!  I have been a loyal customer for several years but I have now decided to not patron this place any longer, the customer service is lacking to say the least!  You can never get a drink the way you order it even though they charge you for the ""extras""! What a sham! NEVER AGAIN!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Love love love this place
 Get the raw lemon almonds. The goleta avocados and santa maria strawberries.  The best organic carrots are at the front near tbe guy with the plants and a moving type truck.

The plouts from this guy that also had red and black cherries is awesome! Bought a beautiful lavender plant for my dad. It smelled so good. And it was $5

Avocado honey, buy it while you can. So good!
Next time im getting some olive oil.........."
Food,4.5,OR,"Super cute little spot. The great thing about this place is they have something for everyone one. If you want coffee and ice cream float they have it, if you want wine they have it. Great lattes also! Seating is limited though so if you planning to drink it there, outside has the most seating but they have about 4 small tables inside and a few window seats. Also a great spot to pick up coffee and go walk around."
Food,5.0,OR,"Delicious funnel cake with a ""fun"" twist to it! Comes in 3 sizes we got delicious toppings fruit (banana and strawberry) and strawberry and chocolate drizzle! The funnel cake is crispy and so fresh! It was a great cure to our crave of our most favorite summer treat without going to the shore! Darnella, the owner is also very personable and so passionate about her business it was a pleasure to get to talk to her for a few minutes!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I love this place. When I was a child/teenager, I was forced to go there with my mother and grandmother and was completely bored. As an adult however, I love to spend a leisurely day there, meandering along the paths. I bring a book to read on a bench amongst the foliage. Ah! I visited the Garden Glow for the first time last week and was immensely impressed. It was well worth the cost of admission. I plan to return."
Food,4.5,OR,"First time visit and random as we were have lunch across the street at Pascucci's.  The ice cream choices are outstanding and served by a friendly staff.  Probably the best coffee ice cream I have ever tasted and was tempted for more scoops.  My wife enjoyed her Pistachio Amaretto & Coconut Almond.  Creamery is spotless and some additional seating outside.  Good place for dessert with many options to pump it up with toppings, and sizes."
Food,2.5,OR,They are very friendly and customer oriented at this state store.  They greet you when you come in and when you leave.  A little freaky that they have a private security guard there but hey we are in Philly!  Didn't exactly feel under siege here!  Good selection and attentive staff.  The staffing is a big plus.  Most state stores have staff that could care less about their customers and this one is an exception.
Food,4.5,OR,"Well, I'm bummed because it looked like a great go-to coffee shop a few months ago and now this is the second time we had to wait 40 mins (!) for our coffee and pastries. Plus, the last two times our order was either forgotten completely or something from our order wasn't delivered and we had to remind. I hope the situation improves - I see one person taking payments and making drinks, so hopefully this staff shortage is temporary..."
Food,4.0,OR,"Our go to place for bubble tea and a place to hang out in the back of the store. 
You can customize the sweetness of the drink.  I love it. Usually get 30% sweetness and you can definitely taste the flavor of the tea. 
We usually get the milk tea, mango and strawberry slush.  Tried the green milk tea- nah... not my thing. I'll stick with my traditional milk tea with grass jelly. 
Popcorn chicken is good too."
Food,4.0,OR,"I ordered a dinosaur cake for my 4 year old and it was awesome! Chad responded to my request quickly. The cake was moist, the chocolate flavor was exquisite and the raspberry curd had just the right balance of acidity and sweetness. My husband doesn't care much for cake and in general doesn't have a sweet tooth but he devoured this cake. All my guests were raving about it and asking where I got it from."
Food,4.5,OR,"We love West Fork! My husband thinks it's even better than Woodford and some of the other name brand whiskeys. Their store front has some great cocktails, with my favorite being the 'silent d'! It's almost too easy to drink. They are located right next to Cannon Ball Brewery and you can order food at West Fork that's made at Cannon Ball. Such a nice addition to the area and now with an expanded space, you'll never want to leave!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Shake it out

I was wooed in with the signage for $3 hand-spun shakes. What I didn't realize until it was too late that we were just getting soft serve with a squeeze of some bottled flavor goo vs. a scoop of good looking hard-packed ice cream from the freezers. Had I known I'd have paid the extra two bucks to get the good stuff. Service was quick and friendly even though they just had one person working behind the counter."
Food,4.5,OR,To get to the point it was a decent place. The customer service needed work. Twice I tried to order with the lady in the front but she would cut me off to talk to someone else. I should've just left at that but I stayed. The chai needed sugar and tasted a bit watered down and the Mexican vanilla latte tasted exactly like flan to me. There was no sugars or milks/creams on the side to add if wanted.
Food,4.5,OR,"The best boba spot in Indiana!! I like their milk teas because they retain a strong, authentic tea taste. A lot of other boba places ruin their drinks by watering them down or having too much syrup. 

The boba is sweet, delicate, and chewy!!

I recommend the ruby red milk tea & king of milk tea. 

Other neat features I like about Tsaocaa is their self-order screens & rewards cards where you can get a free drink for every 10 purchases."
Food,4.5,CG,I honestly used to really enjoy this place as a part of my growing family. I was just in town visiting and had to stop by before dinner and have a couple of drinks. This place is located in an industrial area. I would say it's a very popular spot. The staff is always friendly. I have never seen so many customers coming in and out with a smile. They have a lot of
Food,4.5,CG,This wasn't too far out of the way for me. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday. The lady behind the counter was very rude. She had no idea what to do. I asked if she could help me and she said no. I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.
Food,2.0,CG,Being from another State and this place is the best. I will say that I have been disappointed. I have had the best donuts at the grocery store and the donuts were pretty good. They had no breakfast sandwiches. I would have liked to have some breakfast sandwiches. The staff is always nice. I have also had the orange juice which is made with orange juice. It was delicious! I will

Food,3.5,CG,"Seriously, I could live here! But it's a chain. I will admit that I'm a regular.

I had the Chicken wings. The chicken wings were tasty. The fries were thick and flavorful. The chicken wings were a perfect balance. The fries were cooked to perfection. The wings were a bit too spicy for me. I'm not sure if it was due to the proximity of the"
Food,4.5,CG,"Lil Pop Shop is tucked away behind the Reading Terminal Market.  

The shop has a nice selection of beers and wines, both domestic and import.  There is also a nice selection of local beers.  

I had the American IPA which was very good.  

The service was friendly and efficient.  There is a bar area outside if you want to hang"
Food,4.0,CG,"Would give 0 stars but this place is the worst. I will not be going back.Every time I go in the drive thru, I order the same thing every time. I go to pick up my order and when I'm done, it's the same thing. I've never received a call to let me know the difference between a medium and a medium. I've had issues with ordering my drinks"
Food,1.5,CG,One of the only places that has the best ice cream I have ever had. I have been to other locations in the area but this one is by far the best. The staff is so friendly and helpful. It's a very cool place to enjoy ice cream and some fun games. I love the vintage chairs and chairs and it's a great place to meet with a friend. They have a lot of

I have been in many different Starbucks locations and have never had an issue. The staff is always friendly and the service is top notch. I can't wait to come back and try more of their"
Food,4.5,CG,The best!!!!  We went here on the weekend and it was a nice place to sit and enjoy the atmosphere.   The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice.   We will be back to try out some more of their other flavors.   I ordered the chai and a cinnamon roll with a side of orange juice.  Both were delicious and so was the bagel.
Food,2.0,CG,"I always get huge chunks of banana and almond butter in my smoothie, and I usually just get a cup of milk and I am not going to waste any money on a smoothie that is so good. It's a little pricey for a smoothie, but it's worth it. I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best coffee."
Food,5.0,CG,Y'all my friends are fake! We have been going here for years now and my favorite is the one in Broad Ripple.  The people are always friendly and the atmosphere is so great.  We go here everyday and we will be back.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me and I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional
Food,3.5,CG,"This is my local corner coffee shop, and the coffee is always consistent, and the staff is always so friendly.  The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is so chill.  The only downside is that it's a little pricey for a coffee shop, but it's worth it.  They have a nice variety of pastries, and I've had their bagels and pastries, and they"
Food,4.0,CG,"Pretty darn good coffee and some of the best food in town. 

The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. 

You can't go wrong with this place.This is my favorite Starbucks in the area. They always have a good crew and always make me feel welcome. I love how they take pride in their drinks"
Food,2.5,OR,"I live nearby and have been shopping here for years. Love the convenience, the hours and the pharmacy. Hardworking staff and they do their best. I'm sad that my insurance won't let me use the pharmacy anymore but I still use it for my dad and for shopping. I work long hours and am grateful to the staff and the pharmacists for helping me keep up with my prescriptions despite my crazy schedule especially during the pandemic."
Food,4.0,OR,"Dulce is a must visit whether you live in town or you are visiting. I can't think of anything I've ever had from here that has been subpar - the croissants (especially chocolate), the chocolate mousse cake, the panna cotta - have all been delicious. You can tell that the owner does not take any shortcuts as everything is fresh and made from scratch. I can't recommend Dulce enough. Please pay them a visit. I assure you, you won't regret it."
Food,3.0,OR,"Up early without all the coffee fixings at the casa, sooooooo decided to walk the pooches to the only place open. It's kinda hilarious with the media attention it seemed natural. Cranberry scone on the gummy side but the coffee was absolutely necessary. I like the coffee here, not more than my soul but close. I'd have preferred a local joint but 6:30 am -this is where it's at. Plus they're also pissing off ""christians"" these days so there's that bonus."
Food,4.5,OR,"Stopped by here because we missed the time to go to our originally planned wine tasting. You can choose to taste the dry wines or sweet wines or all for $4-$6; my friend and I went for all. 

I really enjoyed the 382 (dry) and Marathon (sweet with elderberry). The woman who worked there was very nice and made great conversation. 

I want to make it out to the vineyard, still, but this is worth a stop even if you can't."
Food,2.5,OR,"This is my favorite dunkin. It's been 6 years since I used to come to this place once or twice a week and yet when I'm in the area and have a chance to stop by the owner always has a big smile and remembers me. 

The coffee always tastes amazing and fresh. The service is always quick and high quality. And one time I ran out of money on my gift card and they gave me my order for free"
Food,5.0,OR,"Always the best service and delicious mini doughnuts!  If you are looking for  a sweet treat this is the place to start.  It is easy to find and get to in South Tampa...I drive from Seminole Heights for these.  Wish they were open earlier so I could stop by on my way to work.  This is a family owned business, let's show some them support and stop in for a sweet treat you won't be disappointed!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Really appreciated finding this grocery shop that also houses an awesome Vegan Kitchen! Loved that they also have a little section of good quality dog and cat food as I was traveling with my service pup for a conference and discovered we were a little short on food for him! Got to get dog food, while waiting for the deliciousness that is Farmacy's burger! Everyone I met was kind and helpful, this is a gem of a place I'd definitely recommend."
Food,4.0,OR,"Cute new roastery/coffee shop in Seminole! My husband and I came in on a Sunday morning. We love the decor inside and there are lots of comfy seating areas. I ordered the iced mocha with oat milk and my husband ordered the cole brew. They were both very tasty! They also have a bunch of pastries/baked goods available, as well as teas and kava. This is a great addition to the Seminole area and close to home, so we'll definitely return!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Hotel Tango is a nice spot to go for a drink.  The drinks are well made and the service is great.  The one thing that really stands out about this place is the decor and ambiance.  I love the unpretentiousness of the couches, benches, and chairs throughout the space.  The fire place is also pretty cool to sit around in the winter time.

The drinks are bit pricey but well worth it if you're looking for exquisite cocktails."
Food,3.0,OR,This place is the worst Starbucks I have ever been To. The manager Scott work behind the counter like a he knows what he is doing but for all the moving around. The coffee maker has no drinks on it and he is not getting anything done. I have waited several time for up to twenty to twenty five minutes for a single drink. At least once a week my ices coffee is hot. It just not a good place .
Food,4.0,OR,"Liquor Barn is so much fun!! I love seeing the alpacas and goats in their yard. Employees are also super friendly and helpful.

They have a pretty large selection of craft beers to fill up their large space. I ended up leaving with a bag of fresh garlic and no booze (lol) but would definitely come back to buy booze as well. The garlic was so good that it made me never want to buy garlic from a grocery store ever again."
Food,4.5,OR,I went into the store this last weekend for the first time and was blown away by the expertise and level of hospitality shown from the moment I walked in the door. The person on staff was amazing and put me on to a new wine that I have never been exposed to and it was hit at my party. I will definitely be back soon! You don't get this level of knowledge and customer service at the bigger box stores.
Food,4.0,OR,"Really Really glad I Selected Hotel Marazin. The room was impeccably clean and gave me classic New Orleans decor. The staff was extremely nice and the breakfast was AMAZING! Surprisingly the room wasn't noisy even though it's centrally located off the Main Street. Enjoyed Mardi Gras, had an awesome time! At first I was split between the Marriot. I went with Marazin because the price-point was about the same and the Marriot lacked the New Orleans flare I was looking for."
Food,4.5,OR,"Rum distillery tour at New Orleans

Tour guide was very knowledgeable explaining process of how rum are made. He answered all the questions our group had. Learned that rum is made from molasses.

We tasted three unaged rum and two aged rum. I liked gingeroo which is a carbonated ginger cocktail with rum. This product will be available at local costco. We liked amber rum which was aged 1-3years. It had a nice aroma and taste. We bought a bottle to take home."
Food,4.5,OR,"Frozen delight isn't good but isn't bad.  The yogurt itself was actually good, it was the toppings that were, well, strange.  

There was no fruit but an assortment of Heath bar, chocolate chips, granola- basically the usual suspects.  I added brownie bites that may have been freshly baked in 1995. I picked them all off, and I'm not exaggerating when I say I can still taste their staleness.

I'll save my yogurt cravings for pinkberry at the UA games."
Food,3.5,OR,"I went with my roommates tonight and received literally half of a bowl of acai base in comparison to BOTH of them. We held it up and compared, then compared our prices, and paid the exact amounts, which made me extremely upset. I was looking so forward to my bowl after working out for an hour, so paying $10 for half of a regular bowl did not bring me satisfaction.

Still good, but not worth the money, especially when they jip you."
Food,4.0,CG,"I'll give 2 stars for the beer, the food and the location. The food is good. The beers are decent, but the food is not great. I would like to see a little more variety of food options. If you're looking for something different than the typical food, this is your spot. The food is good, but the service is bad."
Food,5.0,CG,"Be sure to get in and out of the store in a timely manner!This is a pretty good coffee shop. The staff is friendly and the coffee is great. I've been to many coffee shops in the area and this one is one of them. If you have a craving for a sweet coffee, I recommend checking this place out. I think you won't be disappointed."
Food,3.5,CG,"Always received good customer service and an amazing cake!  I will definitely be going back!  Thanks for an awesome experience!You must try this place!

Food,4.0,CG,Ok this place is getting better. The quality and quality of the produce is just the same. The prices are not the best but the quality and selection is better than the average grocery store.The customer service is excellent. The staff is extremely friendly. My husband and I ordered a chai tea with oat milk. I was very satisfied with the boba. I wish I could have gotten a bigger size
Food,4.5,CG,"I went here with my husband and I after dinner. We got a cup of the fruit and we got a cup of the banana pudding. The banana pudding was tasty and flavorful. The banana pudding was a little bland in the middle, but it was still very good. The banana pudding was also a bit sweet for the price. We got the strawberry banana pudding which was so good. We will definitely be coming"
Food,4.0,CG,"Great a stop with plenty of options and the food is good. 

The only thing I would suggest is the open front door.  The open front door is great for people watching.I had the best day at a local coffee shop. I was greeted by the lovely staff and the owners. I was amazed at how beautiful the place is and how clean the shop is. I will definitely be coming"
Food,3.5,CG,"Great food for a cheap price. The only downside is that it's close to the park and we have a small parking lot. The food is also pretty good, so it's a nice place to get some lunch in the morning.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me and I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional for my taste."
Food,4.0,CG,I love Elsies. Great place to go and hang out. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday. The lady behind the counter was very rude. She had no idea what to do. I asked if she could help me and she said no. I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.
Food,4.0,CG,Great bookstore! I love coming here. The coffee is amazing. The people who work there are awesome. They are always very nice. The coffee is fantastic!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service.
Food,4.5,CG,"Hands down the best beer in town, and the best people in town! They have a great variety of styles and the best people, both in the beer and wine. They have a great selection of local beers and will even help you find one you like.I've been coming here since I was a kid. I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service."
Food,2.0,CG,I hate Winn-Dixie. The seafood department has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I go there to get my tuna and the people behind the counter are the worst. I go in and they don't even look at me. I go to the customer service desk to ask if they have the best price. I go to the customer service desk and they tell me to speak to the manager.
Food,4.5,OR,"New favorite boba tea place in the Indianapolis area! In a strip mall across from Viet Hua. The inside is so cute and nicely decorated. Employees are extremely nice, patient, and kind. They made our drinks quickly and they tasted delicious! I haven't had this good of teas since I've been to the Bay Area in California. Prices are reasonable, about $5-$6 for a drink and boba is an extra $0.75 but it's all totally worth it. I definitely will be back."
Food,3.5,OR,"Best service during a packed Black Friday in the galleria!  The line was outside filled with impatient shoppers needing their fix.  Once you made it inside to order, the employee at the register named ""Drew"" was oozing with happiness and excitement to take your order and the employee ""Cara"" passing out the drinks and food was just as happy, cracking jokes, smiling and giggling!  Now that's how you run a business!  I give this location a 5 star!"
Food,1.5,OR,"This Walmart is by far the worst one I've been too. Everything is under stocked and lines are very long. 
However, I do want to give credit where credit is due: an associate named Elvis was very kind and helpful when the bathroom was in poor condition, even though he did not seem to be on the custodial team. He went above and beyond what anyone would expect or ask anyone to do to help return the bathroom to a decent state."
Food,4.5,OR,I came on a mini vaca for my anniversary to Santa Barbara for a brew fest and to try local breweries and this place was awesome! It's a new brewery and the beers were great! This was the 4th brewery we stopped at and so far the best. It's a micro brew with fun games! Awesome experience. The owners and workers were so cool! It was nice to visit a new brewery with a great vibe! A place you have to visit!
Food,4.5,OR,"Such a cool, bright coffee shop. I stopped by to meet up with a friend. We got so comfortable there that we decided to spend a little more time than we anticipated. I have not tried their popsicles but I intend to do so very soon. The coffee was great and reasonably priced. I liked the decor as being unique and a perfect place to study or do work. It's bright enough to keep you alert and focused. I do recommend it."
Food,4.0,OR,"The ice is just like Hansen's. Nice and soft and pillowy. They didn't have sugar free wedding cake but I went with the half wedding cake and half orchid vanilla which was pretty good. Added condensed milk. Very happy with it and it was only 2. 75 and huge. Recommend this place. I live uptown but may make the trek over here when I don't feel like waiting in a huge line at Hansen's, snow is just as good and half the price."
Food,4.0,OR,"I love the Orange Couch. 
It's kinda like stepping onto the set of 2012: A Space Odyssey, it does feel a bit like it doesn't belong in NOLA, but that's exactly why it fits in so well.
Their coffee is delish, the owner is a sweetheart, and best yet---all the baristas know when I walk in what I'm there for.
I live for the Oat Bran Muffins they carry.
If they only they picked up some sorbetto for this Lac-tard, I'd give them 6 stars!"
Food,4.5,OR,"What a gem!! If you're looking for really great wine in a great spot next to the river, this is the place. The viognier was different in the best way possible. It was complex and subtle and really is a red lovers white wine. Their flagship red, Turas, was also really good! The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. The patio looks like it would be perfect in the summer. Also, their wine club is a great deal! Try the wine flight!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Been waiting for months for this place to open up as its a great addition to the northeast! The inside is pretty spacious, clean and well decorated. I ordered the coconut sundae (#103). Although they were a bit busy, the food came out promptly. We enjoyed the ice cream and the fruits at the bottom. Only wish that portions were a bit bigger but it's enough to fill your cravings! They offer a variety from ice creams to crepes."
Food,3.5,OR,"Apple Pay and digital receipts. They are ahead of the curve technology wise. Now they just need self-checkout. They have a decent selection, great bakery and baked goods. Fresh squeezed OJ that I love. Their selection is a little on the eclectic side, there's a lot of common products you won't find here. But a lot of uncommon products too. Not the best for a big weekend shopping run due to the eclectic/limited selection. Good for when you need a few things."
Food,3.5,OR,"This place is the worest. Screaming kids, and people that don't speak english are all over this place. The alies are long full of people that don't move. Its hell on earth for a shopper. After you finally get done shopping you have to stand in the longest line you will ever stand in, put all your items on the belt, then you have to bag as fast as you can before the cashier starts loaded up the next shopper. Steer clear."
Food,4.5,CG,"This might be my new go to place for ice cream.

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The place is clean and modern, and the inside is very clean.

The ice cream is good, but they need to update their menu to include more options.

Food,3.5,CG,"We do our primary grocery shopping here, and we love it. 

The store has a nice selection of products, but not as good as the other locations. The produce is ok, and the meat is not good. 

The staff is friendly and helpful. The store is clean. And they have the most convenient parking. 

I think this store is a good place for a quick"
Food,4.5,CG,"Wow, this place is incredible. We have been going here for years and have always enjoyed the variety of different flavors and the unique flavors. The ice cream is the best in the city and it's worth the visit. It's a little pricey for ice cream but it is worth it. The staff is always friendly and they have the most delicious ice cream flavors and toppings you can think of."
Food,3.5,CG,"I love their drinks,I usually go to the one on Virginia but this one is just the closest one.

I had the banana, egg and cheese chai, and it was pretty good. The chai was a bit too sweet for me. I liked the milk tea and the texture of the chai was a bit too sweet. 

They also have a really nice selection of cute drinks"
Food,3.0,CG,This Acme is well stocked and has the best produce in the area. There is a decent selection of other items. The bakery is also very good. There are a lot of items that are local and not in the grocery store. If you need to purchase something you have to go to a place with a cart. The produce section is well organized and well stocked.
Food,4.5,CG,"Ordered a praline shake. The ice cream was fine, but I didn't notice it until I got to the window. The staff was friendly and polite, but the store was packed and the place was extremely dirty. The employee was extremely rude. I will not be coming back. I was looking for a quick stop for a quick coffee and pastry while visiting the beach."
Food,4.0,CG,"My 4 year old is a grown up with the grapefruit smoothie, and I'm pretty sure she loves it.

I love the vintage chairs and chairs and the owner is very friendly and welcoming. I've also tried the coffee and croissants"
Food,3.5,CG,"What happened to Target?  Not sure, but it is a pretty nice place to shop. The self check out is a nice touch. The staff is friendly and helpful. The only thing I wish is that they had a coffee shop. I come here to get gas for the week. I have to stop here every week. The gas is always so cheap."
Food,5.0,CG,"I have been buying treats here for years. 

I love that they have a couple different flavors that I don't get in other places but the flavor of the day is so good. They have everything from peanut butter to chocolate chip. I love how they have two different flavors. 

The shop is clean and has a great variety of options. There is also a candy shop next door. "
Food,3.5,CG,"Stopped off gas at Fry's and it was an absolute blast. We had a variety of flavors. There was a huge variety of ice creams, gelato, gelato, milkshakes, shakes, floats, water, coffee, etc. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I ended up going with the honey almond fudge and it was so good."
Food,3.5,CG,"So excited to have an ice cream shop in the Reno area. 

The shop has a cute aesthetic.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  I would definitely go again.  It's a little pricey for ice cream but I think it's worth it.  They have a nice variety of flavors and toppings.  They also offer a lot of specialty ice cream flavors. "
Food,2.0,CG,"If you are in pain, go to the Wal-Mart.

The staff is friendly and the store is clean. The store is well kept and the store is well stocked.I'm so excited to see this place open in the near future.

Do not go here.

If you go, you'll be sorry, but you're the only one in town.I'm so excited to have found this place in NOLA. This was our first time coming here and I was so excited to find out it was opening up in"
Food,3.0,OR,"The ice cream was good, but not mixed as well as normal.  There was only one person working so the wait was pretty long.  She was very friendly, but extremely slow.  The usual mix-in process was much shorter than normal and there were very large pieces of Oreo and brownies in our bowls because they hadn't been mixed like normal.  The experience was fine, just not as good as other Cold Stone's I have been to in the past."
Food,3.5,OR,their cupcakes are amazing when i had them a few years ago but i'm vegan now and i'm just shocked the amount of years they've been open they don't have vegan options. iv asked multiple times and the workers don't even give me a response. my friends and i have to drive to vegan treats an hour away to stocked up on goodies. We spend close to a hundred every time so unfortunately there missing out on business from that group of people
Food,4.5,OR,"Ok, this place is so fun and lively! My boyfriend and I went to grab a beer before dinner. It was super busy, but we didn't have a problem finding a place to hangout on their patio. I had the avocado honey ale (amazing) and watched the sunset from their patio. The only downside is they don't serve any food, but I saw plenty of people who brought their own appetizers and enjoyed them outside as well. Also, a very dog friendly place!"
Food,4.5,OR,"By far one of the best ice cream spots in the area! I live about 20 minutes away but nothing compares to Sundaes! They have very cool sounding ice cream flavors such as ""Thunder Road"" and ""Sympathy for the Devil."" Their water ice is also very good. My girlfriend always gets the coconut. They also have a sign inside that talks about the health benefits of ice cream! It is a little pricey for just ice cream, but it is well worth it!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Salty peanut butter, Texas sheet cake and Banana Brulee also a side of sprinkles and every single flavor was DELICIOUS! 
The sweetness was perfect not overly sweet but just right. Also a shoutout to Olivia who helped us choose our flavors and was super sweet to my kids, she gave my son sprinkles for his ""side of the ice cream"". I will definitely be back to try the other flavors, they also have a freezer full of their pints so definitely a plus."
Food,4.0,OR,"Can't complain. I am a bit of a coffee snob and this place traveled that journey with me. There were descriptive signs displaying the day's ""batch brew"" that were absolutely spot on. The coffee was delicious.

I will say there were some slightly pretentious folks behind the counter who corrected the way I said the coffee. The problem is they couldn't get it right between them. (How would you say San Roque?) Just give me the coffee I ordered and save the Spanish lesson."
Food,4.5,OR,"Surprise, NOT a market at all. Just pop and beer. So just stay for a night or two at the most. They specifically said no discounts because they are cheaper than anyone else not true. Three-quarters of the park has residence, crummy ones in the back. Who would run a campground between a train line and a 3 way stop light highway! Noisy 24-7.
Dirty broken hard chairs in small, small eatery. Walk your garbage to the other side of park too. Good luck."
Food,4.0,OR,"An entire hallway of a broad selection of single bottles and take out six packs. Really love the fact it has an entire section of ciders and bottled mixed cocktails, for gluten intolerant/celiacs. No frills walk up counter to pay for your selection and seat yourself tables, making it easy to stop in for one or a few, day or night! Two outdoor cafe tables available with tall open windows at front for summer days. I believe it's a $5 min for cards."
Food,2.5,OR,How is this store still operating? Employees outnumber the customers but you cannot get decent service.  Everything looks old and dirty and many of the products I picked up were sticky or gritty.  Selection is abysmal unless your out for packaged liver or day old donuts.  I've gone home twice now only to have to return to the store because items I paid for never made it into my  cart.  Hopefully another chain picks up this incredible location.
Food,3.5,OR,"Ice cream is pretty tasty! I love the Graham Central. They have a large selection and ofcourse you may taste them. Prices are fair, especially since you get big scoops. My only problem with this place is it's basically run by teenagers. Every time I've gone in they are just hanging out talking. The place is always in desperate need of cleaning up.!tables, floors, etc. if they would clean more and talk less that would be better. They also have coupons out there."
Food,4.0,OR,"Love this authentic Mexican market. Not many people know you can actually order food here too! Their carnitas tacos are delicious! When you order 1 it is like you're getting 2. They put so much meat in the taco and give you a second shell to catch what falls out, making a second taco. If you like a big burrito for a good price, this is your place! They are huge! I'd say bigger than Chipotle, and full of tasty meat and toppings."
Food,4.0,OR,"Very nice and quaint ambiance and friendly staff that were very knowledgeable on the menu items. Good open seating and selection of foods and drinks. Great place to chill while shopping or waiting on somebody who is shopping. Place was very clean. 

Menu prices were reasonable. The food was delicious and filling. Everything had great flavors including the ice cream. Payment was quick and we did not have to wait that long either after ordering before we received our food at out table."
Food,2.5,OR,"With the gas station attached and the Starbucks inside the property, this particular Kroger location is seeking to challenge a store like Super Walmart.

Well they don't have clothes and other items, they do have some kitchenware in here, as well

There were some decent deals in here and service was rather good.

All in all, I would recommend coming here. The only thing I found a bit strange was that it was set back a little from a main road. Possibly not the smartest location."
Food,3.5,OR,"It my ""go to"" place when i need just a cat food , and it always just a start! How can you pass on great deals on fruit and veggies?! On the way here i stop in the produce mart and whatever i didn't like there, i am ending up buying here. And the good thing- i can return if quality is not good -the convenience locking in the produce places. In this particular location i like everything, including customer service! In Walmart!"
Food,4.5,CG,"Such a cool little hideaway in an industrial park.  It's a small walk from the main entrance.  The beers are great, and they're dog friendly, so you can go inside or sit outside.  The outside patio is dog friendly.  I got a flight of 4 beers and a flight of 6.  All of them were great.  I think they're all made by a different brewery."
Food,2.5,CG,"Out of most of the time, the employees are friendly and helpful. There is a large selection of beer and wine. The store is clean and organized. The shelves are always stocked and stocked with what I need. The store is always clean. I love the selection of alcohol and beer. I love their wine selection. I like that they carry a lot of local beers as well. They have a great selection of beer"
Food,2.0,CG,"As usual, the service sucked. We had the worst experience. I will not be going back.Every time I go in the drive thru, I order the same thing every time.

Food,4.0,CG,"All in one facility. We go to the other one in the area. There is a large selection. We go in the other one, and they have the same selection. The staff is nice. They are friendly and will help you find something you are looking for. I find the staff to be a bit more than helpful. I also love the fact that they are open 24/7. I just wish there was"
Food,4.5,CG,"Man, this is my go-to bakery. 

I love that they have gluten-free options. I had the banana, egg and cheese, and it was great. The gluten-free options are great. 

I also enjoy the variety of savory desserts. I love the name and unique flavors. I also love the fact that they have a punch card. They have cute little pieces of"
Food,3.5,CG,This is the best damn ice cream I've ever had. My husband and I got the strawberry shortcake and it was amazing. The ice cream is homemade and the price is very reasonable. If you like ice cream you should try it.This place is very good.  The staff is always friendly.  They have the most delicious ice cream flavors and toppings you will ever need.  My favorite is the sal
Food,4.5,CG,"I heard about this place from an employee at the Reno Walmart location. I have a hard time finding a grocery store that is similar to Walmart and then the one in Springfield, MO. The store is well stocked and clean. I am always pleased with the service and the selection. The only downside is that it's close to the mall, but I do not think I will be returning. I just went there to pick"
Food,4.5,CG,I imagine that if my ice cream wasn't so good I would have given it a 4.5 stars.I had a great experience at this location! The customer service was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the flight of 4 different beers and the bartender was very helpful. The beer was great. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The atmosphere was great. I will definitely be back!This place is amazing!
Food,5.0,CG,This place is delicious. I go here at least once a week. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is always very cool. The ice cream is the best I've ever had. The only thing I wish is that they had a coffee shop. This is my favorite Starbucks in the area. They always have a good crew and always make me feel welcome. I love how they take pride in their drinks.
Food,4.0,CG,"I finally made it here and it was the best part of our trip! The staff was extremely friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the different beers. The beer was tasty and the atmosphere was nice. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey for what you get. If you're looking for a fun place to hang out and have a beer, this is the place to go. We love this place."
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is beautiful! Very well appointed and cozy. They have a deck for patrons out front so you can enjoy the Cumberland and LP Field in all its glory.

I had the Bourbon Latte, not bad but a tiny bit bitter which could just be my personal preference. The Pecan Bar was amazing! 

Only 4 stars because the place is crawling with hipsters. It's like Urban Outfitters view book in here. My own personal gripe but I hate single speed fixies and handlebar mustaches."
Food,4.0,OR,"Good ice cream with lots of options for mix-ins.  But it can easily get rather expensive.  I bought ice cream for six kids one night, and our takeaway lunch at Wawa the next day cost less than our ice cream.

If you like lots of chunks and additions to your ice cream, you'll love this place.  But my ice cream tastes are simple (chocolate syrup or sprinkles are all I really add, if anything), so it's not a big draw for me."
Food,4.0,OR,"When I'm having a bad day at work, this is my saving grace and helps put me back in my ""happy place"". Nuts, candy, popcorn, roasted peanuts, dried fruit, imports, etc. and a wide variety of each. Nothing fancy, nor does it need to be because you simply can't walk by with the aroma of those roasting peanuts smacking you in the face and drawing you in. Love the red hot dollars and those mint malt balls."
Food,5.0,OR,"A wonderful family owned cigar shop in Ybor City.  They hand roll cigars on site and it's cool just to watch as you explore the store. Super friendly folks who point you in the right direction and ensure you make the right cigar selection based on your taste.  

They also offer cigar rolling shows for private events.  Mail order and internet order is a nice benefit if you happen to find cigars that you like, but don't live in the area."
Food,4.5,OR,"I can't believe that I haven't reviewed Sucrose yet. Their bake goods are amazing - from the breads to cookies to yummy desserts. One of my favorites is the lavender shortbread cookie.  Wonderful buttery cookie with a hint of lavender. 
I enjoy coming here for a light breakfast on the weekend. A croissant and an excellent iced mocha starts the day right. 
Parking is tight during busy weekend hours but there is street parking nearby. A little stroll just helps justify another cookie."
Food,2.0,OR,"I am going to only base my 5 star rating at the fact that I've been in here on 5 separate occasions and each time I get FREE, yes free ice cream. Their employees seem way too distracted and one gives you your order and nobody follows up with you to ring you up so most people just walk off. Ice cream
Is the same as any baskin robins so I suggest this one in hopes you get lucky and they don't ring you up."
Food,4.0,OR,"I haven't eaten here yet, it is on my list of places to try but I have enjoyed their beer and bar areas. :) I specifically love the people watching here while drinking a beer. The bar opens up to the downtown streets so their is always someone to watch. Usually always packed early evening. The beer beaus (and ladies of course too) are usually great at filling your brews promptly. I will be back to eat soon, I hear the food is great!"
Food,3.0,OR,Wonderful $5 Rotisserie chickens at the deli!  The chicken is very juicy and tasty.  The back has boiled shrimp.  The deli also offers $5 creole and cajun jambalaya.  There are $10 frittatas.  There were no nectarines or peaches in stock even though it is summer.   There is no self-service checkout.  This isn't Walmart.  What you can get at Walmart is marked up higher.  So don't buy those stuff.  Stick with the rotisserie chicken.
Food,4.5,OR,"Martin's has a wide variety of sausages (mostly pork based), and a lot of other pork cuts. I've been getting pork shoulder here recently, and up until the last time the guys were very good about cutting shoulders in half for me, but the last time I got upsold a pound more than I asked for. 

If there's a line, the end of the line is on the right hand side of the counter.

Also I really like the adorable old guy behind the counter."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great coffee and super friendly staff. I wish their cups were a little sturdier or with sleeves. I would also love a veggie or vegan option for sandwiches. How is Turkey not on the menu at all? I would gladly pay for a nice egg and cheese croissant.  Overall, this place has a lot of potential. I get that Riverview is a smaller town but it is growing and becoming more diverse each day. I would love to support local over chain anytime!"
Food,3.0,CG,Lovely location; right off the Monon and the Arch. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday. The lady behind the counter was very rude. She was rude and rude. I will never shop here again. I've been coming here since I was a kid. I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service.
Food,3.5,CG,Careful eating here during Covid! We will be back!Very good smoothies! The staff was friendly and fast. Great drinks! I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here! I love the name and the taste! I also love the fact that they are a little pricier than other bakeries.
Food,4.5,CG,Every beer I had there was a little too sweet. I also liked that they had a couple different flavors so I had to try a few. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. They had a few TVs outside which was nice. I would come back to try some of the other beers.A very cool spot! I love the fact that they have a punch card system. I just went there with my dog
Food,4.5,CG,"This bright little building is a real gem. It is a little hidden, but the staff is always so friendly. 

I love that they have a drive through window, so that you can order and pick out your drink. The drive thru is very quick and you can get a free drink before you pay. I haven't had a problem with the coffee since they opened. They have a great menu of flavors,"
Food,4.0,CG,I tried two beers while visiting SB and both were good. My husband tried a couple of the other beers and we had a great time. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. They had a few TVs outside which was nice. I would come back to try some of the other beers. A nice place to go if you are in the area. There is a great selection of liquor and wine.
Food,5.0,CG,The first thing we noticed was the people working there. I saw people who were in the store. We walked in and the people behind us were chatting with each other. They were all nice. They had everything we needed. I was surprised to see the variety of food they had. I had a chicken salad with a side of red pepper and a side of garlic. It was great. I was surprised to see they had
Food,4.0,CG,"TJ's is a supermarket like this. The quality and quality of the produce is just the same as the other locations.  The bakery, deli, bakery, bakery, bakery, and bakery are all well-stocked.  

The only reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do not want to write a review on the grocery section.  I have never had a problem"
Food,5.0,CG,"Delectable. Delicious. Enticing. What separates this place from the other places I've been to is the customer service. I've had the pleasure of meeting a couple of regulars here, and it's always nice to see a couple of regulars. I've always had a great experience here. The staff was friendly and helpful. I ended up going with a waffle cone and it was delicious."
Food,4.5,CG,Saw this place and Yelp decided to give it a try. The inside is a pretty cool space and the beers are pretty good. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. The only thing I wish they would have was a bigger selection of food. I think it's just a few beers and they don't have the standard styles you can find in your typical liquor store.
Food,4.5,CG,"This place is awesome. The ice cream is amazing and you can't go wrong with the fruit toppings. If you want to try a flavor that is different than what you normally get, this place is a great place to go.I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I got the strawberry smoothie which was great and had a nice smooth finish. I wish I would have gotten the"
Food,4.5,CG,"Tiny, but oh how mighty! We had the almond butter cookie, it was delicious, the chocolate chip cookie, and the raspberry butter cookie. We also ordered the praline chip cookie, it was amazing. We will definitely be back!I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I was a bit disappointed because I had to wait on them for about 30 minutes."
Food,5.0,OR,"I have a sweet thooth . 
Usually take trip to NYC to binge for sweets. 
When I found this place on yelp, i stop by next day. 
I bought 12macarons, 1 almond croissant and iced latte.  I had to take first bite in the car and it was so flavorful. But sadly some of coque was dry and lack of flavor. 
Overall not bad.  It's not Laduree or Pierre Hermes but pretty good alternative. 
Next time I will visit on weekend for Croiffin."
Food,4.0,OR,"Returned to Kahwa today. We broke up for a few months due to unfriendly treatment in the past.  Customer service had been on the downslide. I was in the area and decided to pick up some  Sirocco whole bean & iced caffe mocha.

Happy to report I was greeted with a friendly smile and pleasant thank you!! Didn't get the baristas name but she was friendly & efficient!  Yay!!  Now I don't have to battle the Mazzarro's crowds for fresh roasted coffee!"
Food,3.5,OR,"5 Stars because the woman on shift, stopped her busy routine to ask if my son in the backseat wanted free munchkins. She also saw that we ran out of room for an empty cup and offered to throw it out. When's the last time you had great customer service? I can't remember the last time. More people in the food industry need to have positive attitudes like this woman. Also, our drinks were perfect. Not overloaded with cream in an already sweet drink."
Food,4.0,OR,"I've been a fan of this bakery since I moved here 4 years ago, and I won't go anywhere BUT here for all of my baked goods. It just isn't a birthday or special occasion without an amazing Weinrich cake. Our favorite is the white with butter cream. The cakes always look spectacular, and the staff works with you to create a real work of art that tastes as delectable as it looks. I'd pay even more than what they charge for their baked goods."
Food,4.5,OR,"wow...I've had some good coffee, in fact I consider myself a bit of a coffee snob, and this place knocked my socks off. I ordered a Cafe mocha with soy and it was so pleasantly creamy, rich and certainly not overly bitter or sweet. It had suttle hints of cocoa and coffee with a suttle nuttiness that teased the palate. the owner, a very nice young man, was sociable and you could tell that he had a passion for this. Thanks for the wonderful experience!"
Food,3.5,OR,"We've been visiting one of the close Philadelphia attractions across the street from OCF coffee house (Easter State Penitentiary). 

We had some time before the tour and stopped at OCF to have a  late breakfast.
The service was great and fast! The food was very good, coffee was dissent.
There was a calendar board on the wall with community events, very neighborhood, friendly feeling. The atmosphere was very nice, quit a few people.
I wish I could go back often, but we live in a different state."
Food,2.5,OR,"This is just about the only place I go to fill up my car. I really prefer Costco and Trader Joe's for my groceries because I don't enjoy shopping at a Walmart owned place. But this place works in a pinch. And they actually carry a couple bulk items that I can't get at Costco...Coconut sugar, coconut flour, Ghirardelli chocolate chips. I really like buying my baking ingredients in bulk, so this place does the job for that kind of thing - spices, vanilla, cocoa."
Food,5.0,OR,Who doesn't love donuts? Especially hot and fresh fritters fresh out of the oven-you have to arrive extremely early (6amish- for all the early birds). Excellent quality in their donuts and all other baked goods. This is a place I prefer over donut chains since the establishment is more focused on quality over quantity. I find myself heading here early Sunday mornings at times to grab a dozen for the family. Excellent service and even better donuts/fritters. A must try if you're a donut fan.
Food,3.5,OR,"So, We've just moved out to Da Parish. And its CarnivalTime. I decided to cruise up and snag a King Cake while I was out running errands. Oh. My. Goodness. The shop smelled heavenly!  All Kinds of Goodies!  The clerk was super friendly. They only had Traditional in the smallest size, which was fine by us. The King Cake was fabulous. Fluffy and Fresh. I love their recipe. Not to sweet."
Food,4.0,OR,"I like ALL the Natural Grocers stores, but this one seems a bit larger with a better selection--and I always peruse their Clearance section! They did have a person who gave free help with supplement programs that I learned much from, but she had left when I tried to get another appointment. Haven't tried their new person. Selection of healthy foods and health supplements is good, and prices are better than most places left in Tucson--since a few health food type places have closed down."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great local place with cool indoor and outdoor decor. Amazing chocolate croissants (really good)  and excellent muffins full of fruit. The brewed coffee tastes great but they didn't have bold roast coffees available. The cappuccino was also great but you can taste the citrusy lighter roast coffees even in the espresso. I loved it but my wife, who only likes bold roasts, was less of a fan. The quality was great though so My only recommendation is to add bold roasts to the offering."
Food,4.5,CG,"Want an addiction?  This is a great place to try out new things!  I love the variety of flavors and the prices are a bit high but the quality of the product is amazing. They have everything from fresh fruit, fresh coffee, to frozen yogurt, to hot chocolate!  

The line is out the door, but you can bring your dog and you can bring your dog inside."
Food,4.5,CG,"For the record, I am not an expert on the beer.  

The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I am a huge fan of the IPA.  I love that it's a little lighter than the IPA, but it's still very good.  The staff also always seems to be very friendly and helpful.  

They also offer a food truck.  I went there with my dog"
Food,3.5,CG,"This isn't just your average ice cream, it's just a little more expensive than the local ice cream shops. The flavor is also a bit too sweet for me, so it's not that it's worth it.

The service was also very friendly and helpful. There's also a small parking lot in front of the store, which is great if you're a little rowdy. I was quite surprised to see that"
Food,1.5,CG,"I just got gas at this station and the girl in front of me was just standing there and we sat down. The people behind us were polite, but the first time I went to this station I waited at least 30 minutes for the one car in front of me to get my gas. The girl was taking the phone and I had to wait 30 minutes for her to come up and help me."
Food,4.5,CG,I love Hunters! I'm there every weekend and the food trucks are always around! They have a great variety of food trucks and the food trucks are always out!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday. I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service.
Food,5.0,CG,"Take all my money, Grove!The ice cream was very good. My husband got a vanilla bean and he loved it. Definitely a place to visit and get a treat if you are in the area.I had the best day at a Starbucks. I ordered a special drink for my husband and his friend. The barista was very professional and made the drinks right. I will definitely be back.We had such a great time"
Food,4.5,CG,"5 reasons to give 5 stars. The quality of the food is consistent, the variety of toppings is outstanding, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only downside is that it can get busy in the evenings, but it's worth it to be able to get a drink and a snack while enjoying the weather. I had a horrible experience with the pharmacy staff at this Walgreens."
Food,4.5,CG,"My experience with Grassini was not a bad one.  I will say that Grassini was one of the better tasting beers I've ever had.  The flavor of the wheat beer was nice, and had a great sour finish.  The one I tried was the stout.  The wheat beer was a little bitter, and it had a very weird aftertaste to it.  The stout was quite tasty, and I"
Food,4.0,CG,"I love the fresh wild caught salmon and the shrimp. I also love the cheese board! 

The only thing I don't like about this place is the price. I go here to buy my fish and fish at a certain time. If you're looking for something cheaper than the typical grocery store, this is the place to go.I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and my husband had to pick it up"
Food,2.5,CG,"Gas prices great, really only go here if you want something cheaper than Walmart, just a few cents. I've been going to this location for years and have never been disappointed. I go here with my family and we get a free beer on the way out. The staff are friendly and the food is always great! I will go back to this location and bring my dog!This place is awesome."
Food,3.5,CG,"My husband and I had a great time with the owner, she was very personable and the wines were very good. The tasting room was also very dog friendly, so it was a nice place to enjoy our wine. I can't wait to come back and try other wines and a few more!One of the best ice cream places around! I had the caramel apple and it was great."
Food,3.5,CG,"It's Starbucks. I've never understood what a Starbucks is about. I'm not sure if I'm just being a coffee snob, but I've never been to a Starbucks in a long time.

The store is in a very cool location. It's very clean and well lit. There's a lot of seating inside and it's a great place to meet up with friends. They have a lot of natural light"
Food,2.0,CG,Avoid this location at all costs. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever encounter. They are rude and will not help you. I wish I could give it 5 stars. I don't know how they manage to hire them.I have never had a bad experience at this location. My husband and I went to the
Food,5.0,CG,"Beyond disappointed in this company. We will never go back. I will not recommend this company to anyone.I've had the best experience of a year with the manager, Jenny, and she's always so friendly and helpful.  I've been coming here for years and it always seems to be clean.  I have also noticed the owner's attitude towards the customers.  I've also been treated very rudely by the employees"
Food,3.0,OR,"OMG YUM! I was so excited when I saw this on my walk back to my Air B&B from Vanderbilt University. I had to stop and buy some fresh Kripsy Kreme donuts because in NYC we only have 1 store!

The place was clean, the service was quick, and the donuts were amazing. I ordered 6 of the original donuts because they are the best! It was about $6 and change for the 6 donuts which I did not mind because we cannot get them at home!"
Food,4.5,OR,"These are some badass donuts.

The actually donut is flaky and light. The creme inside is also light and doesn't weigh you down. It doesn't fall into the too sweet trap. I mean they're just badass. 

We came in at about 2 in the afternoon, and there were plenty of donuts. So many places run out of donuts in the later hours of the morning, but this place is prepped and ready for your donut. Sometimes there can be a line. Be patient. Eat all the carbs."
Food,3.5,OR,"So...Its Baseball Nut season.  What can you say about BR31 except it is an oasis of happiness...have you ever seen anyone there who isn't happy?  

Details:
Check out Tuesday night.  Its family night and a scoop is only $1.50.

Our 14 yr old points out that if he gets 2 scoops the waffle cone is free...thus he is really saving us money...Ok I'll give him points for his argument.  
 
Make sure you try at least 1 sample of a new flavor...its always free."
Food,3.5,OR,"Been here a few times. Cookies are tasty and warm. Knocking 1 star off because the sugar cookies I ordered last time tasted minty? Maybe they were in the same warmer as the mint cookies. But what has really disappointed me is that there prices already went up on everything. This place has been open maybe a month? Pretty off putting. Original cookies used to be $1.90, now $2.25. The 6 pack was $11.25 now $12. May just go back to McDonald's for fresh warm cookies."
Food,2.5,OR,"Worst Krispy Kreme ever!! I am a bit of a Krispy Kreme pro, and on my way to Orlando, I got off the highway because there was a hot now sign on the app... I ordered half a dozen ""hot now"" as their hot now sign was on, and I was given four REHEATED glaze donuts and two COLD glazed donuts. I've been eating Krispy Kreme for over 30 years and I know a reheated Krispy Kreme when I see and taste one. NEVER GO HERE."
Food,3.5,OR,Y'all I had no crazy expectation but I'm so disappointed  in my little boy's birthday cake. I wanted a dr Seuss themed cake and they couldn't do actual cat in the hate because of copy right but I wanted something that still went with the theme. I'm so disappointed. This is nothing like what I wanted at all. This is a terrible looking birthday cake. It's not fun at all and definitely doesn't scream child's first birthday at all. Will never use this bakery again.
Food,4.5,OR,"This was my first time in Tucson and decided to check out brewery since it received good reviews.

Stopped in shortly after opening time. I got the Rye lander, which was a very good IPA. Not overly hoppy and was smooth. Cousin got a barrel aged Russian imperial stout. Also was a very good beer. 

The vibe of the brewery was a little dull, but possibly due to it being early and midweek. 

Overall would drink the beer again, however would not go back to the brewery."
Food,4.5,OR,"A cool, local coffee shop with delicious acai bowls and coffee drinks! I always get either the matcha latte or the avocado acai bowl. The music playing is always on point, the wifi is free, and pretty much everything on the menu is going to be good. Since I'm lactose intolerant and don't like soy milk, I always think it's great when coffee shops carry almond or coconut milk. There are also cool hats/shirts and unique local jewelry for purchase. Definitely my fave coffee shop :)"
Food,3.0,OR,"This Starbucks consistently closes 15 minutes before closing time. We drove 20 minutes out of our way to get to this one before they closed, and we got there 15 minutes before closing. We show up to the lights turned off, employees standing inside, and they wouldn't answer us in the drive thru. I've worked at Starbucks before and know that this is a big no-no and is basically stealing from the company. Next time I'll order on mobile so they can't avoid it."
Food,4.5,OR,"A friend got red velvet cake for our family from this bakery. The cake was so goooood. 
I had no idea about this little bakery in Tucson. I am glad I got to know about this place . The cake reminded me of the home cooked cakes and the frost tasted exactly like how my mom used to make cakes , typical trditional cake.
I highly recommend this place . I just have to drive to get one more cake and see this place in person ."
Food,5.0,OR,Leigh Anne is absolutely awesome!  She made the most gorgeous cupcakes for my daughter's 7th birthday party. Her vanilla cake with sprinkles was a big hit!  The kids loved the icing colors and all the decorations. Thank you for helping make my daughter's bday so special- we will definitely be coming back year after year for her to make our birthday cakes and cupcakes. Highly recommend to anyone in the Reno area- super easy pick up.
Food,3.5,OR,My wife and I came today to find a particular pumpkin - Long Island Cheese - for a dinner we are hosting tomorrow. Staff was friendly and the owner showed us several choices; we'll know tomorrow whether our choice was good or not. They had some lovely large butternut squash and we also picked up an apple crumb pie. It was a beautiful fall day and every one we saw was enjoying themselves. Signage was clear and directive.
Food,4.0,OR,"Trader Joe's in Meridian 
I love the new location, which opened a little over a week ago. Even though the downtown Boise store is closer to where I live, I will be frequenting this location on Eagle road because it offers lots of easy parking and the store is 3,600 sq. ft. bigger, which gives it a much more open and comfortable feel. In addition to all of the products you will find in Boise, you will find some new ones, some of which I photographed."
Food,4.5,OR,"Our lives have been changed by Franklin Family Pharmacy! We switched from a large chain, where the pharmacist didn't know us or care about us. My husband takes a lot of medications due to several chronic issues. Todd and his staff always take special care of his medications and know us by name. Todd will even deliver if you need him to. It's always a pleasure to go to the pharmacy now, instead of something I dread. Switch if you can."

The third time I got a iced coffee. I don't usually drink coffee but I would love a coffee that's watered down and bitter. 

I'd definitely come back here. I just wish there was more seating"

This is one of my favorite stores for the most part. I have to stop here every time I'm in the area. It's great. I always get the same thing."

Food,4.5,OR,Tried this place while on vacation because I like a good donut being a future police officer and all. I had to try the 100 layer donut when I read about it online and found out it takes 3 days to make it. I love supporting family owned business like this and the quality is always top notch at these types of places. I forgot which donut I ate but I should have got another to bring back home from vacation because it was ohh so good.
Food,2.5,OR,"Sams has some great sales men's polo shirts for only $4.34, men's swim trunks $4.34, women's flip flops $4.34 and some type of baby outfit for only $1.88!  They may have more items marked down too, but these are all the unadvertised sales I found.  I would hurry before it's all gone!  They also have lots of monthly deals going on with big savings.  Grab a book as you walk in off the table it will show you all the deals going on."
Food,2.0,OR,"Very very dirty, inside and out. Very depressing and creepy. They have a little dining area and today I saw a man sleeping in there. Lots of employees on staff, milling around, eating, conversing with each other, seemingly with no supervision.  Took forever to purchase my one item and there were 3-4 ppl waiting to pay because three staff members were sidelined dealing with a problem with some guy's winning lottery ticket  and no one was running the register until they could resolve this issue."
Food,4.5,OR,"I've been craving boba for months since I moved here from LA. I didn't have very high hopes for finding a good boba spot in Tennessee. But let me tell you, T-op exceeded all expectations I had. The restaurant is very clean and well-lit. The staff was super friendly and gave us recommendations. We got the bubble milk black tea and the affogato ice cream, and we were in heaven. I can't wait to come back for more boba, and I definitely want try a poke bowl!"
Food,3.0,OR,"Have been coming here since they opened. Great ever changing inventory and tons of hidden treasures. Personable staff who will remember their frequent clients. Had the fun experience here some time back of actually being in their tv ad along with my daughter. They asked if i would. I said no way. Then thought why not. Thought it would be shown a couple of times only......... it was shown for years! Things to watch out for here.....fabulous leather handbags, fine English dinnerware  and much much more."
Food,4.5,OR,"I haven't had steak tips since I lived in Massachusetts. In fact, I've never seen them here at all in 27 years! My friend found Southern Steer and the food is amazing. The steak tips are better than my favorite restaurant in Mass. They are marinated to perfection and they melt in your mouth, so tender! They have great daily specials and much more. Goodbye Publix. I'll never buy any kind of meats or chicken anywhere else. And they have side dishes making dinner so easy."
Food,4.5,OR,"Friendly staff. Three of us had large cappuccinos in their mugs.  Every mug had multiple chips in them. Total turn off to our friend and my wife. I just turned the cup so I I didn't have to worry about the two chips in mine.  I was a bit disappointed in the lack of coffee flavor, especially since we ordered an extra shot.  I'd go back if in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip to go there like we did this time."
Food,4.0,OR,"Delicious drinks! I had the 11:11- just the right amount of sweet and tart. Very friendly wait staff. Cool industrial space with lots of industrial ""decor"" about which to ponder its initial use/function. Fun speakeasy vibes, though this could be enhanced by keeping the door closed rather than wide open.
Only downside was a very noticeable strange unpleasant smell, most prominent on the top floor where we were sitting. However the wait staff provided us with some sage to burn, and this incense successfully covered the unpleasant smell."
Food,4.0,OR,"Coming here since I was little and still one of the oldest and best ice cream shops in the Bay Area. Born and raise Tampaian here and grew up on Bo's ice cream. They e remodeled so it definitely looks cleaner than I remember. Picnic tables available as well as a drive thru. Still staffed by young teens but they are friendly and attentive. Ice cream still yummy and can't go wrong with anything ordered. We got a soft serve vanilla cone, strawberry shake and pineapple shake."
Food,3.0,OR,"There was no one in there when I came in, just walked in an ordered a simple grande iced black coffee. I waited 15 minutes. They were only filling mobile orders. I get that they may have precedence because they want you to use the app, but I was the only customer in the store. Why put me behind 6 mobile orders? This was the longest time I have ever waited at a Starbucks ever. Usually they all have great customer service, this was a surprise. Disappointed."
Food,5.0,OR,"I was SO incredibly happy with the services provided by Darrin and Sierra and the entire Jump On The School Bus team! Not only were they super helpful throughout the planning process but also they did an incredible job coordinating and executing transportation for a very strict venue, a ton of guests, and extra moving around that I added in to fit our needs. Their drivers were so timely, helpful, and kind, and our guests loved how unique their buses are right down to the personalized hashtags."

By far Dream Team House tops any local Calgary bubble tea house.

I would so recommend Dream Tea for anyone who wants something new or if they're strolling around WEM"
Food,4.0,OR,"This place is so good that I devoured half the Mt.Vesuvius sundae (shared with friend) 1 hour after eating two scoops of ice cream from Bassetts. But to be honest I could have finished it myself.

The space brings you back to an old ice cream parlor, filled with old time drinks and candy. The menu options are ridiculous, and it all looks so good. LOOK AT THE YELP PICTURES! How can you not want all of that? It tastes exactly what it looks like...amazing.

A must-stop in Old City."
Food,3.5,OR,"I do like to grab a burrito bowl from Animo every once in a while...the food is decent, but not overly special or anything. The one thing that is always consistent is that at least 80% of the staff looks and acts absolutely miserable, and they can never get your order completely right. It's unfortunate, because if they improved on those 2 aspects I'd definitely eat there more often. Just a side note - they really need to redo the menu chalkboard so it is easier to read!"
Food,2.0,OR,"This one star review is for the pharmacy only. They are the absolute worst. There has not been a single time that I've come here and had my prescription filled quickly and efficiently. There is LITERALLY ALWAYS a problem. They never have what I need and it usually takes them 30+ minutes of me waiting around to figure it out. After today, I've decided it's worth going ~10 blocks out of my way to get my scripts filled at a more efficient pharmacy and save myself some stress."
Food,3.0,OR,"Once I got on the auto refill program, haven't had an issue. When I was there Saturday to update insurance information they were very helpful. Unfortunately my insurance won't work here, but they got me another discount. And the woman who helped me also gave me a 30% coupon while I waited, since it was time to refill my scripts. Worked for me. The cvs next door is a pain to get in and out of, especially from the direction I live. Rite Aid is so much easier."
Food,5.0,OR,"This is the perfect little pub away from the craziness & bustle in the FQ! It's located behind the Irish museum, super quaint and beautiful. They have a full bar, but I highly suggest a Guinness on tap or one of their specialty Irish cocktails! Our friends that were visiting us (we live in Nola) loved it so much, they went twice! The bartender was super nice, which is also a big plus! In a city that thrives off of fast service, this is an excellent hidden gem!"
Food,3.0,OR,"The ice cream was delicious, the place/setting is darling and the service was incredible. The girl who scooped our ice cream had very long, brown hair and a big bright smile!  She was friendly and seemed happy to be there. Some of the other staff looked unenthused but she served us so well and seemed happy to do so. 

Hoping the supervisor reads these and gives that girl a raise. Because she was a bit of sunshine on this rainy evening. I think her name was Elizabeth."
Food,3.5,OR,"Why no sign about being closed at the entrance to the drive thru or even the board where you give your order??? I waited behind another car for ever and then pulled up and tried to order not knowing that you were closed. There was a sign on the drive up window but what good does that do? I drove around after finding out that you were closed and told the 6 cars waiting in line about being closed. You are Welcome!
This was on 8/8/2020 in the afternoon."

While visiting family, I always stock up on their wine before traveling back home (these bottles have made thousands of miles of traveling w me!!) I love the Apple wine. It's perfect for fall. They also have a winter wine. It's so great for Christmas. Both the flavors are especially great for thanksgiving. Really nice place! Definitely visit on a nice weekend afternoon when you can kick back and relax."
Food,3.5,OR,"I came here for coffee once because Starbucks was too busy. Can anyone tell me what's wrong with the previous sentence? Let me break it down for you, I considered Starbucks first for coffee. Ugh! I hate Starbucks. Considering that this place was second choice to Starbucks...well that's got to tell you something. The coffee is pretty much as nasty as Starbucks only cheaper and they have a stamp card. I can't tell you anything about the cinnamon buns because I'm allergic to both cinnamon and cream cheese."
Food,4.0,OR,"A tri-level urban retreat in the Central West End with some very interesting experiences.
Upstairs is the lounge-- exposed brick walls, interesting modern art work and different nooks where you can hang in a cozy intimate setting with friends.
Middle floor is the wine bar and cigar cellar which feels a lot like a cafe in Europe.  Fantastic outdoor seating on a warm summer night.
Below is the cellar where they have little after hours gatherings.  Word has it that it was a speak easy back in the day."
Food,2.5,OR,"The pharmacy service is terrible. They mix things up, are extremely slow and unconcerned about it, and pretty unhelpful to customers. The pharmacist will not help you get your script if there's any issue with doctor or insurance, she will just stare at you until you are not standing in front of her anymore. This is just not what I am accustomed to, as a longtime pharmacy tech, but rather unprofessional. I will be switching pharmacies for a better experience going forward and recommending others do the same."

Not only are these ADORABLE, but they taste great too!! I'm sure his guests will be thrilled with a little sweet favor as they leave the party.

They had a green tea flavored frozen yogurt which looked fun. The peanut butter frozen yogurt was great! It was salty and sweet all at once. I got it with chocolate covered pretzels which I would recommend for sure. The pretzels were also salty and sweet and fit well with this flavor. This place is located in the food court next to terminal C."
Food,3.0,OR,"I needed a specialty item and I found it in stock via the Target website.   They even tell you what aisle it was in and lo and behold(!) there were actually five of them there.  This was great and made for an easy shopping experience.   Of course I picked up a few more things while I was there but being able to see that they had it in stock plus location made it easy in and out.

FYI, there is a Starbucks here and self-checkout."
Food,4.0,OR,"All I can say is WOW! Faubourg Brewery has done an amazing job re-branding, and their beers taste delicious as ever! I tried the Dat'Suma IPA and loved it--it has sweet undertones. The food was also delicious; I tried the burger with a beyond beef patty to make it vegetarian. I loved how they had a vegetarian/vegan option.

The Trash Grits and The Crawfish Poutine are also pictured below! The poutine came with a decent amount of crawfish. I would highly recommend coming here and enjoying their gorgeous out-door seating!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Main Street is a great place to go when you want a wide selection of liquors without the fuss of a high-end retailer. Prices are reasonable, and the staff is eager to help. One employee was happy to explain the bourbon selection at length when we were in need of something specific but didn't know our options. I know that I can find just what I'm looking for at Main Street. 

I'm going to have to check out the super bargains in the back--that's where the real savings are!"

Don't tell my mom, we ate a couple in my car after lunch at Daily Eats!!

Food,2.0,OR,"Was at a friends birthday party when we left in the morning to get coffee and a pastry. We arrive at the location and all is smooth until we received our second order, a double chocolate mocha. My man Jordan took a sip and though it was single chocolate. After further inspection we realized tbat the crackhead barista spelled JordAn with an E, JordEn. How drunk was this guy to make a mistake so simple. Will not be returning for at least 3 weeks maybe more."
Food,3.5,OR,"You're not gonna get any royal treatment here but you're not gonna have to pay for that either. The prices are the best! The selection is great and the meat and produce is always fresh. To top things off its employee owned! 

Pack your patience as the store can get a little crazy, but your wallet will thank you for shopping here. Also, be aware that they only take debit cards and you need to be ready to bag your own groceries. Trust me, it will be worth it!"
Food,1.5,OR,"Horrible service! When ordering an iced coffee, the cashier was extremely rude and got my order wrong and blamed for it. She thought I said iced tea, but because of COVID we all have to wear mask and she might've just heard me wrong she swore I said iced tea and yelled at me for it, when I went into the store to correct the mistake in person she yelled at me the whole time blaming me for what she misheard while I was still being respectful to her."
Food,4.0,OR,"This Starbucks is my absolute favorite in town. I love the layout and large windows, making this coffee shop always bright and open. They sport a drive-thru and were crazy quick with my online order (even though I live 5 minutes away), so really great if social interaction makes you cringe like me. The only thing for me is that one of their male employees is always a little TOO cranky for me; I'm sure he's already had his morning coffee unlike me. Oh! And they have doggie treats!"
Food,3.0,CG,I'm pissed that I'm even here. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star is because the two employees that worked there were extremely rude and seemed annoyed that I was there. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were busy. This is my first time at this location and I will never come back. I'm not sure if it's due to the bad attitude or just because I don't like the atmosphere and
Food,4.5,CG,Was really disappointed with my experience. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the store is a little small. The store itself is small but the employees are nice. I went to pick up a couple of things and I was told it would be ready within two days. I also had a woman in the electronics department who was very helpful. I didn't see her name but she was very helpful. She seemed to be happy to answer my
Food,3.5,CG,"Tonight I witnessed CASSIDY touching my hand and the girl in front of me was just getting a cup of coffee and I had to leave, I took my order and left. The only other thing that made this store convenient was the fact that they had some coffee and tea to choose from. I had a friend who was a huge coffee drinker and I ordered a coffee with almond milk. I didn't get a coffee I didn't like"
Food,4.5,CG,"It's okay. I usually only go to the one on Virginia but it's close to the one on Virginia. 

If you're looking for some fresh produce, this is the place to go. I mean, it's a grocery store. If you're looking for some local produce, this is your place. They have it. I can't wait to go back.I love this place. It's right next to the train station"
Food,5.0,CG,"What an AWESOME place!! My husband and I came here for a cold brew and a drink and the staff was so friendly and accommodating. The place is small but you can't go wrong with that. They had a few flavors to try, they were all delicious and the atmosphere was very cozy. We will definitely be back!I was in the area last week and I was so excited to see a cute little spot! I love the atmosphere"
Food,5.0,CG,"Best cake donuts I've eaten here. The cake donut is a nice cake donut but the cake donut is the best I've ever had. The flavor of the cake donut is amazing and I can't wait to try more flavors. If you're looking for a good donut experience, stop by this place!They are always busy but the service is always so quick. They make my drinks right! I love the atmosphere and"
Food,4.5,CG,"Everything about the town is that it's an ice cream shop. There is a large selection of flavors and toppings. The ice cream is homemade and the owner is very friendly. They have a few flavors to choose from. If you're looking for something different than ice cream, they have a few choices. I had the blueberry sorbet and it was delicious!  It was creamy and not too sweet."
Food,3.0,CG,"So pleased with the service and flavors, the ice cream was creamy and delicious, the customer service was fast and friendly, and the location is perfect for the area.This place is amazing! I came here on a whim and I am so glad I did! The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The owner was very nice and so was the owner! I will be back!I used to love this place"
Food,5.0,CG,I can not say enough good things about the food. I will be going back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday. The lady behind the counter was very rude. She had no idea what to do. I asked if she could help me and she said no. I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy. I was turned away by her.
Food,4.0,CG,"Great brewery. Parking is very easy. The food is good too. Also, the people are friendly. I've had the best experience of a year with the Tchoupitoulas family. They are friendly and willing to help you find what you are looking for. They also have a great selection of wine and spirits. I also love the fact that they have a punch card. They have a great selection of beer and wines."
Food,2.0,OR,We tried to buy a significant amount of groceries today and the clerks refused to help us us our ebt card. The card is old and does not scan well. All other walmarts in 4 states were able to manually enter the card numbers and this walmart refused to even try. We paid for the groceries as we did not have time to shop elsewhere with money that is for other bills.The staff were rude and not at all helpful. We will not be shopping at this walmart ever again.
Food,2.5,OR,"If you're in University City and you want to go to Starbucks, this is the one to go to. The baristas work so hard to keep that long line moving along quickly and smoothly. And they are so cheerful while they are at it. It CAN be hard to find a seat, sometimes, because the place is small and it gets really crowded. But that makes it lively. Drinks are made right. Cream and sugar table is always well supplied. Despite the crowd, they manage to keep the place clean."
Food,4.5,OR,"I had an engagement party at Mechanical today! The manager Leah was amazing!!! She helped set up and break down the party and made sure that every customer was happy and had a beer in hand. She went above and beyond and made my party so special! She made sure to have heaters out, and the beer lists and helped my mom blow up balloons! I love this place!!!!  Their beer is also amazing, and it is definitely my favorite brewery! I wish I could have my wedding there!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I came here this weekend with my family. We each got different flavors and there were a lot of options to choose from. I settled on cookies and cream. It was very creamy and good. It is cash only though and the location is a bit rundown inside. It also felt a bit confusing as people were coming through two different doors and it want clear if you went to the register or how you ordered. All that aside, the ice cream is good enough to check this place out."
Food,3.5,OR,"This Starbucks and another have been my favorite during a recent ""tour"" of the ones in our area. There is spacious seating, and after a recent remodel the place is looking more modern. 

The employees here are among the best I've encountered at a Starbucks and the only negative about this location would be how it lacks a drive-thru, but that is something to take-up with the corporate Starbucks as opposed to this location.

Should you need a place to just sit-back and have some coffee this is a fine location!"
Food,2.5,OR,"This was the 7-Eleven that was geographically closest to me growing up, but I've only been here a handful of times.  Someone told me that they had rap snacks here and I wanted to check it out to get some birthday gifts for my wife.  I happened to be here On July 11th, so they had free slurpee's too.  I grabbed a cup and lid, but an attendant told me she would fill for me.  Got my drink, bought three bags of chips and was gone."
Food,4.5,OR,"Oh my god. The tacos. THE TACOS!

Who would have thought you'd find the best tacos in the city under a little tent in front of a parking garage selling beer... they were incredible. With home made sauces and perfectly charred tortillas, you could tell the chef was inspired and cooking was his passion. I had the lengua taco and I swear I'm salivating at the thought of having some more. I really hope this chef gets the press he deserves.  I also wish I had more photos of :("
Food,3.5,OR,"OCF Coffee house is situated in a great location and has both a good vibe and decent sized tables if you're looking to get some work or studying done. The staff is friendly and they have a wide selection of drinks and pastries. 

I am a fan of coffee and espresso drinks and, for the price, OCF's selection definitely lacks in quality compared to other cafes and coffee shops throughout the city. To echo the other reviews, this place is great in many ways, but does lack in drink quality."
Food,2.5,OR,"Floral review! If you didn't know this..... Safeway carries a decent selection of flowers. Of course, it varies from store to store.  I stopped by this one to  checkout their rose selection and get some balloons for my father in law. I was pleasantly surprised to see so many bright colors (shades of pink, orange, yellow) and they were are very fresh! The roses are not very fragrant but they lasted well well over a week. The safeway on Swan and Sunrise also has a nice floral department!"
Food,3.5,OR,"I come here almost every day on my way in to work and the staff is always so upbeat and friendly. I think that Starbucks coffee in general is consistent so I like having the go-to standards and I don't stray from my order very often to explore the menu. I will say that on the days I can't leave work for lunch the protein boxes are life savers for me. 
Drive through or inside- the drinks are great every time, the place is clean and the service is friendly."
Food,4.0,CG,I came here on a weekend afternoon and the line was out the door! The guy working the front was so nice and the place was clean and inviting! I got the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was delicious! I will definitely be coming back and trying some of their other treats!I'm not a huge fan of Krispy Kreme's donuts but this place is a good place for a quick bite or a quick snack.
Food,3.5,CG,There was a bug in the air and the AC was too cold. There were a few customers inside and it was very uncomfortable. The guys working there were very friendly. The only thing that bothered me was when I asked if I could bring a car. I don't know how many people were there. I was also the only person in the car and it was a little uncomfortable. I didn't mind the coffee and the food but the experience was so
Food,3.0,CG,Was not impressed at all. We had the almond croissant and it was just ok. We also had a cupcake and the cake was good but the flavor was not great.I'm not sure why this place has such low ratings. I wish it was closer to my house. I love the name and the interior. I also love the fact that it is a little pricier than other liquor stores. The store is clean and the staff is
Food,4.5,CG,"I've walked by Gelato Di Riso and thought it was good. The gelato is a little too sweet for my liking. The flavor was not the best I've ever had. It was a good flavor, but it was not very creamy. The texture was not a lot of chocolatey or flavor. I'd definitely come back. I just wish there was more seating."
Food,4.0,CG,"4 stars mainly for the convenience of the store and the fact that they offer a variety of items.

I had a friend who was in the neighborhood and wanted to take her to a place where she could find something to enjoy. The shop itself is very clean and well organized. There were a lot of unique items to try, including the kombucha. There was also a lot of cute items, such as jars of wine and some cool books"
Food,2.5,CG,"Ordered Ham GC Melt thru the app and the girl in front of me said ""it's just a coffee so we don't get a coffee that is the same."" She was very rude and condescending. 

I'm not sure why she is so rude to people in the industry but it's not a good thing because she is the owner and she is a complete jerk.We love this place.  I love the atmosphere and the music"
Food,4.0,CG,"I have ordered from them for a couple years now. I will say that the cookies are pretty good. The employees are pretty nice, but they're the only ones in the store. The place is small and not open. I would suggest you go if you're near the mall. This is a great place to come and grab a drink or two and bring some friends. I love the fact that they have a small beer garden right outside."
Food,4.0,CG,"I am so glad that this place exists. It is a little on the pricier side, but worth it. 

The ice cream is the best, and it is made fresh. They have a few flavors to choose from, and some of them are some of the best I have ever had. They also have some of the best ice cream in the area. I also love that they have a lot of fun flavors like strawberry and raspberry."
Food,4.5,CG,"I love the concept and the flavors, the ice cream is creamy and delicious, the staff is always so friendly and the prices are a bit high but the ice cream is great and it's worth it. 

The only downside is that it is very expensive for the size of the ice cream. I have to say it's worth the $5-$6 for a scoop. They have a great variety of flavors and toppings to choose from."
Food,2.5,CG,"Manager sunny and workers are always friendly and helpful.  I will continue to go to this store.I've had the best experience of a year with the manager, Jenny. She is so helpful and friendly. It's a very busy store and the lines move fast. I would definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.I had a horrible experience with the pharmacy staff at this Walgreens. They were extremely rude and made my day."
Food,4.5,CG,"What a beautiful, open industrial, and an amazing space!  I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and she said no.  I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.  I just went to order and she was rude and rude"
Food,4.0,OR,"Unexpected. I was in this shopping center visiting another business and saw a brewery in the corner, so I had to check it out.

It's a rather small space inside with maybe about 10 or so beers on tap. 

The place was actually packed with a standing room only crowd of people enjoying craft beer. Some folks were outside. There is a larger patio area with tables chairs and a fire pit out there.

The brewery backs up to the Monon trail so easy access for walkers, joggers, and bikers to the brewery."
Food,2.5,OR,So I went through the drive thru and got potato wedges as well as a panini. Only after I had paid for my meal did they tell me they ran out of potato wedges. They were kind in offering me something to replace it and I said a couple hash browns would be alright. They only gave me one which I felt was unjust due to the price difference as well as the inconvenience. Also paid for a chipotle sauce which they did not give me. Would not recommend this location.
Food,3.5,OR,"A line of 8-10 customers and I watched 2 of the 4 employees doing nothing to help serve customers, one was actually yawning, flipping her ponytail tail around and drinking a beverage.  No one giving direction or trying to show a sense of urgency. Finally,  one of them started helping and the line started moving. Cashier was very nice once I got there, coffee was as expected. I admit that I use Starbucks for convenience, so it is frustrating when it is not as efficient as it could be."
Food,4.0,OR,"This is my second visit here and my sons and I love it, again. Today we got scoops of ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, and I got an float. Look, I've never had an ice cream float before today, but that will change going forward. I got a 'Ladies Choice,' a raspberry soda with peach ice cream and raspberry compote. It was NOT sugary, at all. Very fruity, flavorful, and just...perfect. I love it here, as I love ice cream in the winter (weird, I know) and they have not disappointed."
Food,4.0,OR,"OK this place is amazing. Its like an adult playground. Plan on spending some time. There's just too much to take in!
The staff is super helpful. They know their product. I had questions about a particular wine and they directed me to an affordable bottle that was perfect. My favorite is the airline or mini bottle selection. Hundreds of choices. Its perfect if you just want to try a new liquor but don't want to invest in a big bottle. Or if you need just a small amount for a recipe."
Food,3.5,OR,I'm usually a HUGE fan of target but this was a strange one. The customer service wasn't that good and people were a bit obnoxious. I accidentally exited through the entrance and the security guard made me turn around to through the other side. Really? There was no one else around and it was kind of petty. I'll still shop at target but I'm not coming back to this location. I would have given it 1 star but had awesome service at their Starbucks so I decided on 2 stars instead.
Food,4.0,OR,"We come to Shipley Donuts at least once a week. Their donuts are wonderful, and you can tell that the employees genuinely care about their product and the customers. I love their unique cream filling. It is very different from bavarian creme. I think my favorite is the Bull's Eye. It's a combination of a chocolate iced donut with a creme topping and sprinkles. Their chocolate filled is similar to a Hubig's Pie. The location is convenient, and the parking is easy."
Food,2.0,OR,My family and I shop at this Walmart regularly because  it's the closest one to where we live.  We try to get in and out as quick as possible.  BUT that's nearly impossible since they only ever have at maximum 2 lines open and the one (sometimes the only ) line being the 20 items or less line. If you have a lot of items and it's the only one open you will be guaranteed  to feel like you're a horrible person by the customers behind you.
Food,4.5,OR,"I came here Friday after work. It was really clean inside and didn't have that meat market smell. They had a big selection of meats. It was my first time buying from here so I only purchased a few things. I bought lamb chops, chicken wings and a pound of steak. I cooked Some of the lamb chops Friday evening. I was pleasantly surprised at the size and the fact that they didn't shrink after being cooked. The meat remained soft after being cooked. I will be back for future purchases."
Food,4.5,OR,"Had the perfect desserts to finish off my day! The creative offering will keep my coming back. You can definitely get a scoop of ice cream at a lot of different places, but black Rock dessert is definitely worth a try if you are looking for something out of the ordinary! I fell in love with passion of goat ice cream and loved it in the Jesse's Tropical Trip  and my husband loved the sundae with all the fixings! We will definitely be back to try even more unique flavors"
Food,5.0,OR,The system was down today and couldn't take money. That's okay. They gave me my coffee and did so with a smile. The lady ahead of me was a complete douche. She was all cranky about it. That's okay douche lady. I tipped them $10 and will continue to go to this Star Bucks. Minus one virtual star for not having a drive through in Safeway for my lazy moments. Plus one virtual star for the employees being fabulous! I love you to the moon and back coffee. I mean Starbucks.
Food,4.5,CG,"Man, I love this spot. I love the variety of drinks they have in their menu. I always get the taro milk tea with boba and it's great. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I also love the fact that they have a lot of choices. I love how they have different flavors of teas and smoothies to choose from. They also have great milk tea flavors."
Food,3.5,CG,"I quit drinking coffee.  Not a fan of the coffee.  

The person who served us was not very friendly.  There were no signs or directions to place an order.  They had no clue where to find a coffee shop.  I don't know how many people were in there.  Maybe the people who served us were more interested in the coffee than the customers.  

If you're in the area, I"
Food,3.0,CG,"Went through the drive-thru at this location and the girl in front of me was just standing there and we waited an hour. The lady behind us took her time and was so rude and made us feel uncomfortable. 

We waited a bit for our coffee and the girl in front of us had a name tag on her hand and she looked at us and didn't say anything to us. I just went to order and she was there and"
Food,4.0,CG,"You get 2 big scoops of ice cream with toppings.

The staff was friendly and we got a small scoop of the Apple Pie and then the Taro. The waffle cone was a little hard to eat, so it was a little hard to chew.

The only downside was that it was a bit crowded, but the ice cream was good. It was $6 for a small, but I think I'd go back for more"
Food,5.0,CG,Cute little corner bakery with some of the best ice cream I've ever had. I was just in town visiting and had to stop by before dinner and have a couple of drinks. The line was long and it was a good size. The shop is tucked away in a industrial area. I love the vintage feel of the place and the vintage decor. I had the brownie sundae. It was great. The ice cream was creamy and delicious.
Food,3.0,CG,"Didn't see all the reviews here. The coffee was good but nothing special. The people were rude.I had the opportunity to visit a few places in the area, and it was pretty cool. The staff was very friendly and I enjoyed the atmosphere. My boyfriend and I ordered a chai and a cappuccino and both were good. The coffee was good, but I'd rather get a croissant and a frappuccino."
Food,3.5,CG,"An amazing experience for me.  The owner, Chris, is a lovely person who is passionate about his craft.  The tasting room is beautiful and the atmosphere is so great.  We had a great time and will be back.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me. I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional for my taste, but I love the fact that they have some cool"
Food,5.0,CG,"Our first trip to the brewery. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the beer, the local breweries, and the breweries. The place is a bit small, but the inside is very large and it's well kept. The outside is a bit small, but I think it's worth the visit. They have a nice outdoor area and also a food truck out front. There was also a food truck outside for the night. I can't wait to go back!"
Food,3.5,CG,"I visit this location often, and I am very pleased with the quality of the product.  The prices are competitive, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  I have purchased many items from here and they are all good quality.  I enjoy going to this location.Great location with great service. 

I ordered a large iced coffee with oat milk and it was delicious. 

The employees were nice and helpful. 
"
Food,4.5,OR,"Hole in the wall of hole in the walls, this lil grocery store tucked away in aresidential area of West Tampa serves up convenience store essentials and some food. 

They had a few leftover day of the dead candy skulls and some expired hot sauce when I was there. I was told the owner grills ribs and chicken outside on Saturdays. 

Definitely rough around the edges but an interesting place. Not to be confused with the Rancho Grocery and Meat Market serving up hit food and pupusas on Armenia around the corner."
Food,4.5,OR,"Sad. Adorable cakes, store and nice people. Love the store, not the cakes. They taste like something from a gas station in a plastic wrapper and the frosting is just awful. Tried several flavors. Was excited about this store. They may be baked on site, but they are not made from scratch on site. Mass produced and very commercial tasting. Disappointed. They would have made a great gift, but would be embarrassed once they were tasted. I guess everyone else doesn't taste good cake very often."
Food,4.0,OR,"A must visit, at least once, for tourists and residents. Yes it is pricey, but so what. Have a little fun once in a while would ya? Being cheap is not fun. Lines are long? Um, that means it is worth the wait for many. Instead of whining about long lines, use the time to people watch or, gasp!, strike up a conversation with the people in line - people in Philly are friendly despite what you may hear. The ice cream is ridiculous and the fudge... oh man. Just do it."
Food,4.5,OR,"Very cozy and friendly atmosphere.  Nice selection of cakes, cookies and gelatos.  We got the blueberry cake, a couple macaroons and a slice of caramel pie.   Everything was very good, I hate saying this but the blueberry cake was too sweet (I know I'm eating cake and it should be sweet, but this was hurts your teeth too sweet).   I think it was the buttercream that was overly sweet.   Otherwise it was delicious and I will return to try again on my next trip"
Food,3.5,OR,"I love this place! It wAs my first time trying Bula and I'm so glad it was here! 
The building is super cute and had a great beachy (and pet friendly) outdoor Area. 
Since it was my first time, my first cup of tea was free. They flavored it with vanilla and it was pretty tasty. Our server/barista explained about the benefits and traditions and was just wonderful in general. I also LOVED the strawberry infused water. 
I will definitely come back on a nice day to enjoy this quant little spot."
Food,4.0,OR,"Great location on the water next door to the gift shop (with a single stall bathroom), but limited indoor seating (which is so crucial when the sun's hot out) and only 1 person working over 4th of July weekend (= it was a madhouse inside, though he seemed very friendly and attentive to be fair) and we left without actually tasting anything). Bummer! 

They had a selection of maybe a dozen or so wines (nothing sweet, that I recall) and there are some coupons/offers for flights if you look around before arriving."
Food,4.5,OR,"The best ice cream in America!!  It's thick, rich, and creamy. Oh and even better, it's made with real, whole ingredients; no fillers or chemicals added. I tried the strawberry cheesecake first at a local shaved ice shop that uses only McConnells ice cream. It's damn good!
Then a friend took me to the actual shop in SB and there is no turning back now!  I'm hook!  
I love that I can find my favorite flavors at my local whole foods and Vons. Although, my scale isn't too thrilled."
Food,4.5,OR,"Best place in Metairie to get a snowball!

Located in the heart of Old Metairie, Sal's has been a neighborhood establishment for as long as I can remember. Every year I know summer has officially arrived when I pass by Sal's and the window is open. They have a great little building on Metairie Rd., complete with a bunch of cut logs to sit on as you enjoy your frozen treat. My favorite flavor is Dreamsicle, with condensed milk of course. 

BOTTOM LINE: The tip of the iceberg when it comes to snowballs."
Food,2.5,OR,"I am so annoyed with this DD. they are so completely unorganized that its shocking. I mean who is managing this place?? every single day one of our coffees is wrong. I order the same thing every morning. If I say large hazelnut coffee regular, that is basic STANDARD coffee speak for a hot, large, hazelnut flavor, not that stupid swirl sweetened one, and regular cream and sugar. This is standard, yet no one at this location knows it!!! If someone orders coffee it's hot unless you say iced!!! train your staff."
Food,4.5,CG,Great experience! Everything I came here for was outstanding! We will definitely be going back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday. The lady behind the counter was very rude. She had no idea what to do. I asked if she could help me and she said no. I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy. I just went to order and she was rude to me.
Food,3.0,CG,"I recently started working around here. The only reason I don't rate this place a 4 star is because it's the closest Walmart to my house, but if you're a local, this place is a great place to shop.I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I got a vanilla latte, which was very good. I wish I could have gotten a bigger size! I also got a fresh slice of pretzel that"
Food,4.5,CG,"I think the Mazfresco Market is an easy walk from downtown. The market is tiny, but is well-stocked. The produce and meat section is clean and well-stocked. The seafood department is in good shape, and there are a few things that you would never see at a grocery store. I do wish they had a few items on the display case, but I didn't see any of them."
Food,4.0,CG,"I couldn't be more disappointed. The only reason I didn't give this place a 4 star is because I felt the staff was a bit unorganized, and the place was packed. I was pleasantly surprised by the outside seating, as it was warm and sunny. The staff seemed to be very friendly, and the place seemed clean. I didn't think the food was very good, but I guess I'll try it out."
Food,3.5,CG,I'm a super fan of the flavors and the taste. I also love that they have a couple different flavors so I can try different ones before deciding on the flavor. I'm definitely going to go back and try the flavors. I will definitely be back!I always like to try new products and a new place to shop!  I love the fact that they have a wide selection of specialty items.  This is not a place I'm looking for everything I
Food,4.0,CG,"I like the new space, it's a very comfortable place to work, have a cup of coffee and read.  The staff is friendly and the coffee is tasty.  I would definitely go again.

I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional for my taste, but I love the fact that they have some"
Food,4.5,CG,When the only thing negative about this place is the parking lot. There is a lot of trash everywhere and the parking lot is a mess. The parking lot is a mess and the traffic is extremely long. The staff is extremely rude. This is my first time at this location. I have to say I will not be coming back to this location. This place is awesome. It's right next to the train tracks.
Food,4.0,CG,"If you're in Santa Barbara, this is the place. I will say that I have been a frequent customer of Bier's since they opened and have been a customer since. I go to Bier's in the winter and I am always excited to try new things. There are several locations in Santa Barbara that have a great selection of organic produce, and they are always so busy. They have a great selection of fruit, as well as some healthy foods."
Food,4.0,CG,"I was there last Saturday. We had the free wine tasting tour and a free cheese tasting. We got a sample of the cheese plate, which was delicious! We bought a bottle of wine that we didn't purchase. The wine was fresh and flavorful. My husband got a glass of the wine and a glass of wine. I enjoyed each of the wines and enjoyed the atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend this place. Came here for the first time today."
Food,4.5,CG,"I'm slightly obsessed with Dairy Queen. The fact that they're open 24 hours is a huge plus. I had the banana split. It was the perfect amount of banana and banana. It was a little too much for me, but it was still very good. I also got the chocolate cookie. It was a bit pricy, but I think it was a good deal. Overall, I would definitely come back here for dessert."
Food,5.0,OR,"I wish I could rate it more than 5 stars, was looking around for local places to purchase a keg for an event I was having. Had trouble securing a keg with other places, even Frugal MacDoogal wouldn't guarantee a keg for me. I called Music City up and they took care of me right away and provided exactly what I needed, great pricing and even better service! Can not remember the lady working the counter but she was one of the nicest people I met and very helpful, will definitely be back!!"
Food,5.0,OR,"By far the best vape shop in my area! Been to several ones before, they were the only ones who always took time to let me try different flavors, showed me how to use my pen properly and their prices are unbeatable. Amazing team! Jamal (owner) is awesome, friendly and professional. And if you like good coffee and different coffee creations that's the place to go as well!!! Beautiful, well kept and modernly designed shop.
Shout out to Johnny, one of the friendliest and most helpful people I have ever encountered! You guys rock"
Food,4.5,OR,"I don't really know how to put my love of Wake into words. I go about once a week to enjoy the bacon egg and cheese (on a brioche bun with homemade hot sauce, it's unlike any other bacon egg and cheese I've ever had) along with an oat milk latte. I also consistently buy their coffee grounds so that I can enjoy their coffee all week long even when I can't come in. The service has always been quick and the employees are so friendly.  Would recommend to anyone I know."
Food,4.0,OR,"Pretty cool place. The atmosphere seems to change every weekend but is a really great introduction to the kava bar scene. All of the drinks I've had haven't tasted very good but I know not to expect much from the flavor of kratom drinks. They do the job, and Its a really nice euphoric feeling. There is one amazing tea tender there, I'm not sure of her name but she wears bandanas and is always incredibly patient and helpful. She deserves a raise, guys. All in all, a pretty solid place to hang."
Food,2.0,OR,"I'm seeing others who have the same horrible service with the most rude employees ever in any place I've ever been to in my life. Deliberately overcharging too? No. not anymore. I guess its time to give up the urge to ever go to this place again. I won't do it. Enough of their horrible treatment toward a customer. They really don't care. A simple order like iced coffee gets so complicated because their ""baristas"" are impossible to deal with. This is not a real Starbucks and their employees show that its not."
Food,4.5,OR,We really loved our experience here. It is a nice area with a big tasting room and a bar with tvs where my husband could watch the game. We got some flights and hung out for a while after getting dinner down the road at Okura. The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable about their beers. I would definitely come back on a warmer day to take advantage of their outdoor seating area. This area needed a nice brewery hangout spot and I hope we see you here for a long time to come!
Food,4.5,OR,"Your classic NOLA snoball stand with classic flavors. I love a good snoball and what makes a good snoball is super fine ice and Sal's delivers!

I love their chocolate and the orchid vanilla flavors. Add vanilla soft serve ice cream for a real decadent treat! 

They have 2 windows open to better serve the demanding crowd during peak times. There is also a seating area of made up of tree stumps to enjoy your refreshing treat under the shade of an oak tree. The perfect way to enjoy a summertime treat in NOLA."
Food,4.5,OR,"Original craft brewery in town, definitely had to visit. Upon entering it had a really foul smell, like a mix of dog food/cleaning supplies. Weird, I know. So that led us to just grab our flight and sit outside. The beer was ""good"", but lackluster IMO. It's a fairly large place, the staff were chill, and the merchandise section was good. Got some legit glassware & other stuff for some buddies of mine. Heard they're moving to a new spot, so next time I'm in Nashville I hope to have a better experience!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I really thought they'd have a more extensive menu than what they had. As a new customer they did a horrible job actually explaining the menu and the differences between their limited array of products. It could've been that there was a line, but that shouldn't matter. Their doknot coated in cinnamon sugar tasted good, but was more dense than I expected. It's definitely more sense than any donut I've ever had. Their croissants were GINORMOUS today. I just wished they tasted better. I tasted flour instead of what should be buttery goodness."
Food,3.5,OR,"I don't usually have a reason to go into Walmart Neighborhood markets, but my Niece drove by and needed to grab something so, why not?

The store is large, like half of a super walmart with all the grocery needs you might have.  I really only spent a few minutes up in the front, looking for the restrooms (Small, but clean with 2 stalls for such a large store. ) 

Personally, I'm not a fan of their layout as I'm a Publix fan, but they're conveinent to the neighborhood and open 24 hours."
Food,3.5,OR,"I used to live about 3 blocks from here and it is easily the best place to pick up produce and meat and baked goods I've ever been to.  The area called ""Asia Box"" (I am pretty sure that is the name, correct me if I am wrong) serves up some GREAT pad thai and GREAT assortments of asian food.

I am salivating right now thinking about this place.  The best part is that what you can't get here, you can probably find right next door at Trader Joe's, and vice versa."
Food,2.5,CG,"Even though my last experience here was the last, I've never had a bad experience here. The owner is super friendly and the beers are good. The atmosphere is nice and it's nice to sit and watch them make the beer. The food is great and the food trucks are great. I love their food truck. I hope they start getting better and better. I've heard great things about their food truck! I highly recommend it!I am so happy that I"
Food,3.5,CG,"Like the name says, multiple times I've come here and I've never had a bad experience. The owner is super friendly and the beers are good. The atmosphere is nice and it's nice to sit and watch them make the beer. The staff are friendly and always willing to help you with anything. The place is clean and the owner is very friendly and knowledgeable. I've also seen a couple of people bring their dogs and they all love their dogs."
Food,3.0,CG,"Es un lugar seguro pero, an suvada. Tres leches, a la la el suvada. The people behind the counter are the nicest people you'll ever meet. They are friendly and will greet you when you walk in. This is a great place for a cold treat. And they have the most delicious ice cream in the area. I've had the cheesecake ice cream, peanut butter, mint chocolate chip, and"
Food,4.0,CG,"Came here after we ate here. The menu is simple but it's simple. I ordered the coconut milk tea and the pearls, both were delicious! The customer service was very friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back!I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I was a bit disappointed because I had to wait on them for about 30 minutes. I was quite surprised to see that there was only one girl working and that"
Food,4.5,CG,"Once upon a full bladder, I had the pleasure of using the restroom. There were a few customers in the bathroom but the staff was not welcoming and the place was clean. The only other thing that bothered me was the bathroom. I am not sure if it was because I was in the bathroom and a woman in the restroom was checking out. I would definitely come back here. I just wish there was a bit more seating outside."
Food,4.5,CG,"It is truly about time that I have come to Reno for a cup of coffee. I just can't get over the deliciousness of their coffee. The flavor of the day is so unique and delicious. It's a good place to meet up with friends or to meet up with a friend. They also sell a variety of pastries, muffins and pastries. I also love that they offer a variety of flavors to try from. The staff is very friendly and"
Food,4.5,CG,I came here as part of a Yelp Elite event. I saw a lot of people were just hanging out and we had a great time. I got the white wine and the rose. Both were excellent. The rose was very sweet. I liked the rose. The rose was a little too sweet for me. I'll definitely be back for more of the wines. I would recommend to anyone who likes a strong rose.
Food,4.0,CG,"This enormous supermarket is a little pricey, but the quality is good. There is a decent selection of other items.  The bakery is also very good, and the prepared foods section is nice. They have a great selection of organic foods. There are also some items that you would never see at a grocery store.  I especially like the salad bar and salad bar.  I also like the prepared foods section.  I do think that they have some of the best"
Food,3.5,CG,"Updating my review because the ice cream was good, but I will not be going back. 

I am very disappointed. The ice cream is okay, but the service is horrible. I have had to wait in line for over 20 minutes for my ice cream. There are several people working there who act like they hate their jobs. 

I would like to see more of their customers working there. I am sure it is just a bad day."
Food,1.0,OR,"I would give this place a 0 if I could. The customer service here is horrible. The cashier, Krystal, rolled her eyes at me the entire time she took my order and was extremely rude. They were out of almost everything at 9am on a Sunday. Instead of the cashier communicating nicely other options to what I wanted she just snarked and rolled her eyes. I was very caught off guard by this because I rarely right bad reviews, but had to after this experience. Horrible service, long wait time, and they are unprepared."
Food,4.0,OR,"Our first experience was great about 1 year ago.  We went for the second time and my daughter asked for a brownie sundae, and was given 2 bite size pieces of brownie that was microwaved to burning hot and her sundae did not come with whip cream.  I ordered my favorite root beer float.  The used hot A&W soda.  They did not have root beer syrup.  My float was warm.  This place could have a lot of potential.  It is a shame we will not be back."
Food,4.0,OR,"At times I say to myself ""it's time to cook and save"" which last for about a week. So I think this will be one of those weeks. Lol...well I love Whole Foods and by far this has been the best one I have been to since moving to Westchase. The customer service here is literally above and beyond. Their staff are a bit overly friendly...it's scary :-) This will be my local shopping spot. Plus I like the options of the 10 cents saved on grocery bags going to the local food pantry"
Food,1.5,OR,"At first I wondered how a Starbucks could possibly have a two star review. After visiting, I completely understand!  The service at this place is awful!  I had to wait for the two employees working to finish their conversation before they even bothered to ask what I wanted. 
Once my drink was ready it was promptly plopped onto the counter without a word being said. The team working was then able to get back to their conversation without customers interrupting them. 
This is by far the worst Starbucks I've ever been to!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Came here for a few drinks with some friends and was pleasantly surprised. This place has a fantastic beer selection from a lot of local breweries and also has some nice cocktails. The decor is really nice too and gives off the feel of upper scale old time bar. I had the gimlet here and it was great, not watered down and tasted amazing. The bartender and staff were all very friendly and didn't chase us out after last call. If you want to try some good local beers you should definitely come here!"
Food,4.5,OR,"There aren't many places outside of Broad Ripple or Downtown that can provide the type of eclectic, relaxed atmosphere one finds at Strange Brew without it feeling forced  (e.g. any of the ""Yat's"" locations outside of the two original spots on College and on Mass).

Fortunately for Southsiders, Strange Brew's trendy mix of mismatched furniture and rotating local art displays helps keep things interesting while still providing patrons with a sense of something familiar.

It's cozy, it's inviting, and the coffee and food offerings are delicious.  If you haven't been, you're definitely missing out!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Coopertail is a welcome new addition to the Tampa bay brewery scene! 

After moving away and coming back home, I was surprised to see so many new breweries pop up in the city. 

Coppertail has a huge selection of amazing craft beer as well as wine and other drinks for folks. There's sours and wheat options that taste amazing. 

The food menu has a little of everything including meatless options which I'm always looking for. 

We can even be the people at the bar with kids and everyone from families to singles is welcome!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I think Indy needs more places like this! What I like about Yoya is the location is good, and they have frozen yogurt too so I can go there with people who don't enjoy boba as much as I do. 
They have so many items on the board. I got strawberry milk tea with boba and it was great. Not too sweet and it was a great dessert for me. 
I wish they had more seating though, they have some comfy chairs there and I had a relaxing time  while enjoying my tea."
Food,4.5,OR,"Have not been to their new location but I love this tea shop. They have an amazing  tea selection, lots of cool  tea pots and cups, and the staff is always so helpful.
I have gone when I was sick with a specific issue and not only did they find a tea perfect for me, the gave me a home remedy to try that really helped!

I also like how they keep track of your tea purchases so you eventually get a free tea :)

Awesome local tea shop, I always recommend it to friends"
Food,3.0,CG,"I had a very disappointing experience with the customer service. I asked her for help and she said ""I don't know"" I then said ""I'll be right with you"". She then hung up and told me to leave. 

I then asked for a manager and was told by a woman ""I know"" and she said ""I don't know"". I asked her if she was doing anything about it and she said ""well, I don't know""."
Food,4.5,CG,"I've been coming to Pops for a long time now. I'm not sure if I'm just being a little too lazy to say, ""I don't care, you just don't care."" But I still enjoy the good flavor, the size, and the friendly staff.

They have a wide variety of flavors to choose from, and I've had several different ones each time. I always get the ""not bad"" and ""tasty"" one ("
Food,4.0,CG,"I was happy to find this place and the ice cream was creamy and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. The only downside is that it is hard to get to in the summer. If you are looking for a good treat with great service, this is your spot.This place is great! They have a great selection of cheeses, meats, and seafood.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is"
Food,1.5,CG,"If I could give it a 4 star rating, I would. 

The customer service is terrible. I had to ask for a specific item that was not in stock and it was just a matter of days. I'm not sure why. I was charged for two things that were not in stock. I was charged for one item and got the other item I wanted. I will not be returning. 

This is not my first time shopping at this store"
Food,4.0,CG,"My favorite grocery store. The employees are always friendly and helpful. My favorite is the deli. The other two have the best bakery, deli and salad bar. This place is so cute! They have everything from fresh cut veggies, coffee, frozen yogurt, to some great vegan options. They have a great selection of vegan and vegetarian options. There's a lot of options for vegan and vegan options. This place has a lot of vegan options too."
Food,3.5,CG,"Received order after several weeks-don't go here anymore. Went here after dinner for a drink and the staff was so rude. The place is filthy and dirty, you can't even get a bag of coffee and no one in the store. The one customer in front of me was talking to the lady working behind the counter, the one in front of me was having trouble getting her attention. I didn't want to be treated like I was an inconvenience."
Food,4.0,CG,"Went here on Saturday afternoon and it was a very crowded place.  There were about 4-5 people in the front and the line moved quickly.  The customer service was okay, but it was a little awkward to be in a coffee shop.  I don't know how many people were working there but I was the only one in the shop and it was a little overwhelming.  I was quite surprised to see that there was only two people working and the line"
Food,1.5,CG,"The Pharmacy Manager (Kathleen Wnuk) was extremely rude and made me feel uncomfortable. When I asked her how to do my prescription, she said, ""there is no way to do it"". I was so upset that she didn't even try to do it. This was the first time I have ever had a problem with this pharmacy and I will never go back to this pharmacy again. I will never go back to this pharmacy again."
Food,4.5,CG,"Cage is always a good time. The only problem is that it's close to the park and we have yet to find a spot, but that is okay. There are a lot of spaces to sit and watch the movie. I would suggest you do the same for some people. The only downside is that it's close to the park, but I think it would be nice if they could make a stop there to see if there's anything on the menu."
Food,3.5,CG,"The Turnip Truck is similar to an island with a lot of history. There is a lot of seating and a small bar area. The food and drinks are good, but it is not that big of a selection. The outside tables are clean and the chairs are comfy. The staff is always friendly. I have never seen anything like this before. The only issue I have with this location is that it is very small. I am not sure if it is a good"
Food,4.5,OR,"The location itself is a warehouse, in a mixed residential-commercial neighborhood. Why would anyone come here? Easy - world class wine. Go to Los Olivos and Santa Ynez for the beautiful atmosphere and and the fun of a wine-tasting trip, but Craig Jaffurs' wines are better than 99% of any wine you'll taste within 100 miles, especially Jaffurs Syrah. Wine-tasting is subjective so your opinion may vary, but when wine lovers ask me what are the one or two wineries they must visit south of Sonoma or Napa, for me this is one of them."
Food,2.5,OR,"I wanted to leave an excellent review of the wonderful service I received from the employee Jody. (Sorry if I spell your name wrong!) I've been to many Starbucks but he put in more effort than any sales associate I've made contact with at other Starbucks. He made the experience fun and enjoyable. He asked if it was okay to surprise me with a drink, and I ended up loving it! It was an iced soy milk Chestnut Praline. I loved the surprise. This is something that makes people regulars. Thanks again, I'll be back!"
Food,3.0,OR,"I had a great experience here at the CVS pharmacy. I moved from another state recently and the nearby RiteAid could not figure out my insurance, told me I had to pay $160, etc... Annoyed, I went to trusted CVS a mile away and they had everything on record, had my prescription filled within a few hours, price was only $10 as it should be. All's well in the world when CVS has their shiz together. The pharmacists were kind, knowledgeable, and quick. Will definitely come here from now on for all my prescription needs!"
Food,2.5,OR,"I really wasn't impressed with this place at all. It's basically a shack off the side of the road that sells produce and items that were grown at other farms in Missouri and Illinois. 

We did take a hayride... which led us to one pony to pet. We couldn't pick any apples or pumpkins, or run around in any fields. There's a small playground for kids to play on, and they can ride around the inside of the barn on tricycles. 

You're better off just going to your local Schnucks, and visiting a local playground."
Food,4.0,OR,"Passed it on the way to a Girl Scout camp early Saturday morning. Looked it up on Facebook to see if it's be open on Sunday for our trip back. Yep!
I love me a cute coffee place off the beaten path and this did nothing disappoint. 
My teenage coffee critic sidekick said it's the best vanilla caramel iced (decaf) latte she's had. (And those are a fave of hers, so she's had a lot of them). I had the iced mocha latte. LOVED! 
Fast and fantastic! Soooo glad we tried it! Would def try again!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I was walking around Bourbon St in the French Quarter. Many people were drinking in the French Quarter. I didn't feel drinking. I wish I could! I was thirsty and wanted to buy some soda and breakfast tomorrow morning. I found here. It looked like Walgreen or CVS in the French quarter. I saw many drinks. I found Dixie beer. I drunk it later at my accommodation. It was so good. I also found sushi at this store!
If you are looking for some soda or breakfast in the morning. Please visit here."
Food,4.5,OR,"I always love going to this coffee shop because the quality of the coffee and their simple yet fabulous menu. With handmade syrups like lavender and cardamom, my taste for the slightly out of the mainstream is perfectly met every time. The space is good for small group chat or for working on your own. I love the decor and I love the people who come here as well. Great place to grab a cuppa Joe and just chill or plan your adventure out in Boise. Plus, it's perfect walking distance for the Saturday market!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Talk about a lot of flavors! I was taken here by a friend on our walk on the monon. It's a prefect spot to rest and grab a treat. I had the pistachio ice cream and it was amazing !!! The scoops are pretty big, so I'm glad I only ordered a small. Just an FYI if you go inside, you take a number and then they'll call you up to order. When we went in there wasn't any direction and after 15minites we finally figured it out. But all in all good ice cream!"
Food,4.5,OR,"As someone who is a St. Louis native, I have to say this place hands down is the best place to grab a cup of coffee and get stuff done at. The vibe there is killer and the baristas make you feel welcoming. Not only that but if you're looking for a place with a killer playlist to work to, this IS your place. 

I had their iced coffee and I could not stop thinking about it for days. The food they offer there are legit, I wish they would serve it all day long!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I recently had the chance to try Eddie's donuts and I have to admit they are much better than the chain store / Dunkin Donuts variety. One of the great things is that Saint Louis has many family owned donut shops scattered around the South City area, I am not going to say one is better than the other because they are all great. However the staff at Eddies is friendly and is proud of their quality/selection. Donuts are great, and prices are good, too. I suggest stopping by, you will be glad you did."
Food,2.0,CG,"Overpriced and poor customer service. Not sure if they are just trying to keep this place in business, but I guess it's a bad idea. 

I think the place should be better. They need to learn how to make a coffee shop better. This is my first time at this location.I love this place!  I love the fact that it is a little hidden away from home.  I love the beer selection and the fact that they have a good"
Food,1.5,CG,"I always come to this location because the employees are friendly and the parking lot is a little tight.I've had the best donuts at the grocery store ever, and it's pretty much the best donut I've ever had.

The raspberry filling is a perfect combination of"
Food,4.5,CG,"My  most regular stop here is the coffee.  I always love my latte and the pastries are always fresh and delicious.   The staff is always so nice and polite.  They are always happy to help me out.  If I need to get some work done, I always stop here.  I go to the one in the area and I've never had any problems.  This is my new go-to coffee shop.I always feel very welcome"
Food,4.5,CG,"On the way in to Tampa, I thought it would be a nice place to get a cup of coffee and have a few people watch. The staff was friendly and the coffee was great. I ordered the flight of 4-oz. My boyfriend got the white chocolate chai and a plain chai. Both were good. The white chocolate chai was also good. The chai was a little dry for my liking."
Food,4.0,CG,I walked up to the register and the employee who helped me was very kind and the person helping me was so nice. The store itself is very clean and organized. I was very impressed with the customer service and the store itself.I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was a bit disappointed because I had to wait on them for about 30 minutes. I was quite surprised to see that there was only one girl working and that I was not
Food,4.5,CG,"After some great reviews we decided to go with the ""Cookie Monster"" which was a chocolate covered pretzel.  The pretzel was good but the pretzel was a bit too thick.  We ended up throwing it away.  The pretzel was good but the pretzel was not a good choice.  I did get a hot pretzel with some brownies and cream.  My husband got the hot pretzel and he got a pretzel with some hot dogs"
Food,3.5,CG,"I really miss their red velvet cake, but the chocolate chip cookie was delicious. I would recommend their red velvet cupcake to anyone, and they're the best cupcakes you'll ever eat. They also have vegan flavors, which is always a plus. This is a great place for a party or a family outing. I hope they can expand their menu with some more options!I will say I went there with my sister for the first time and I have to say I am"
Food,4.5,CG,"This had to be the best ice cream ever! The employees were friendly and welcoming! I ordered the Strawberry shortcake and it was delicious. The kids had a scoop of the Strawberry and the Sweet Cream. It was a good size, and it was a very rich and creamy ice cream with no artificial flavors. I also got the Honeycomb and the Sweet Cream with Vanilla ice cream. They were very good, but I wish they had more. The prices are a little high for"
Food,4.0,CG,"A place you'd normally find in an industrial park, which is a nice place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. The only downside is that it can get busy in the mornings, which is probably why I always come here. The only downside is that it's close to the park, but I've never had a bad experience here. I just wish there was more seating inside, and they have some cool seating outside."
Food,3.0,CG,This Starbucks location is really nice. The employees are friendly and the parking lot is pretty large. The coffee is always consistent and the staff is very friendly.I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I was looking for a quick stop for a quick coffee and made a recommendation to come here.

I am a huge fan of the customer service at this store.The customer service is excellent. The staff is always friendly. This store is always well stocked. I always get a great service. I go here almost every weekend and it is always so clean. They have a great selection of beer and wine. They have a great selection of wine and beer
Food,2.0,OR,Went to Dunkin' after seeing a few commercials. Was not sold. Ordered a frozen coffee with whipped cream. Was very excited to try and see how it would compare. Was very disappointed as I left the drive thru. No whipped cream. Frozen coffee should have been named iced coffee as the ice was barely blended. Couldn't even finish it and I felt like it was a waste of my time and money....they also just tried to shoo me out of the drive thru after only receiving half my order. 10/10 would NOT recommend. Thanks for reading.
Food,4.5,OR,"How could you not give this place anything less than five stars?! Board games; delicious brews; beautiful open space; CLEAN restrooms; lovely outdoor seating, should I go on? 
The Hazy IPA is top notch and I find myself already craving it after having one, or maybe two, whose counting? I'm pretty impressed with the Tucson beer scene and even more impressed with the prices charged for these delicious brews. Three bucks a beer? Heck yeah, I'll take six, make that seven, ha! Thanks so much crooked tooth for making my afternoon a bit more enjoyable."
Food,4.0,OR,"Baby and I love to stop in at Sweet Lucy's for ice cream. They serve Woodside Farms ice cream (including some flavors specially made for them). Now, Woodside Farms might not be the natural, farm-fresh ice cream its name implies (see my separate review of them for details) but it sure is tasty and we like trying new flavor combos from the friendly folks at Sweet Lucy's. We've even committed the heresy of skipping Charcoal PIt's sundaes after getting burgers there in favor of Sweet Lucy's. Hope Baby doesn't lose her native Wilmingtonian card for that!"
Food,5.0,OR,"My sister and I both really enjoyed our experience here. The shop itself was very nice and the decor was simple but cute. The workers were very friendly and there was a great assortment of product! I got an iced orange vanilla latte and it was absolutely delicious! Not too sweet and the espresso had a really nice flavor. They also had some really cute vinyl stickers for only $2 so I got a couple of those as well. Overall, this place has good vibes and great coffee! I highly recommend to anyone in the area."
Food,2.5,OR,"I hate the concept of state run liquor stores (especially ones that close early and on Sundays and every holiday you could think of).  This is America, dammit!  I should be able to load up on boxed wine on 4th of July if I want to!

But yeah, this one isn't bad.  Not the best selection, but not the worst.  Wish they had more wines in the fridge.  The people here are quite nice too.

But seriously, a policy change is in order for this state.  It's borderline treason, in my opinion."
Food,2.5,OR,"The folks that work there are usually very pleasant.  I just wish they were as competent.  4 out of 6 of my last orders have had something wrong with them. I've gotten the wrong drinks, poorly made drinks, sloppy sandwiches with no napkins to help with clean up and I've gotten the wrong donut twice.  This all happened in one month.  I figured it was just a bad stretch and wanted to talk with the manager. Unfortunately my attempts and requests to communicate with them were never reciprocated. Really disappointed. Horrible management."
Food,3.0,OR,"Bigger and better then the Huck's close to my home and they offer gas too. It's like a mini U-Gas. Great selection of fountain drinks and convenience mart type items.
They even had a small area of table and chairs for those who want to sit and grab a bite to eat. 

What makes Huck's special is the fact that they are employee owned. When the one waiting on you is part owner, you know you'll be getting good customer service. If I lived in Kirkwood, this would be my convenience mart and gas station of choice."
Food,4.0,OR,"I love this service! As someone who suffers major food sensitivities, this is a fantastic option that takes the guess work out of counting calories and measuring food and painstakingly having to read every label. It's super easy to supplement the protein with frozen veggies or your own fresh salad to get extra micro-nutrients. 

The customer service is also fantastic - FedEx made a mistake one week with our delivery and the folks at Metabolic Meals were quick to take action. 

All in all, for the price and the convenience, MM gets a 5 from me."
Food,4.5,OR,"I've tried to come back to you this year Ted, but it just isn't working for me anymore. 
Your custard isn't as thick and creamy as it once was and your staff is developing attitude. 

You are no longer the only custard in town, you now have competition and they are all serving up a better product. Even Andy the new boy in town is providing a superior cup or cone of custard. 

I know I am giving a big thumbs down to a St. Louis institution, but it really isn't that good, guys and gals."
Food,3.5,OR,I have no clue what just happened but it was cool. This place is definitely not just ice cream but an experience. The staff were very good about explaining how things work but basically you choose your base and flavors and they put all the ingredients in a metal bowl and then some kinda crazy magic happens and there steam oozing everywhere and before you know it you have delicious ice cream. They have vegan and lactose free options so that is cool. They also do Italian ice if you are looking to avoid the calories.
Food,2.0,OR,"Always pay attention to the expiration date on the package of the items you purchase, because they sell expired food.  I bought at least two items that expired on the date of purchase --which I never paid attention before.

What's even worse...they refuse to return the kitchenware which I found has obvious defects when I use it for the second time, although it's still within 3 months of purchase. They said once I stepped out of their store they are not responsible for it and asked me to contact the factory by my own. Really? OMG."
Food,5.0,CG,"Hipster popsicles. That's my best word. The flavors are just too much. If you're looking for a new flavor, the best popsicle place in the city. This place is definitely worth a try.The store is in a very small strip mall. This store is a bit small, but the store is clean and organized. I also love the fact that they have a punch card. They have a great selection of beer and wine. The only downside is that"
Food,4.5,CG,"Hansen's snowball is legit. One of my favorite flavors is the pumpkin pie. It's a little hard to find, but the staff are always helpful and friendly.I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service. I've tried a few of the flavors and they all always taste"
Food,4.5,CG,Well this was another trip that I had to make. I saw a lot of people ordering the cakes here so I had to get a dozen. The cakes were moist and flavorful. The icing was a little hard and not very flavorful. The icing was sweet and rich. I would have loved to have a sweet layer of cake. I would have liked more frosting but the frosting was a bit too sweet. I would have liked to have more frosting.
Food,4.5,CG,"My first visit because I saw a sign with the ""Coffee for a buck"" and we were so excited. The place is small and small, but the inside is very large and cozy. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the decor. The prices are very reasonable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back for a great cup of coffee.This place is great. I like that they have a great"
Food,3.5,CG,"I have always loved Maggie's. The quality and quality of the produce is always excellent. 

The employees are always helpful and friendly. The produce is always fresh and very fresh. 

The only thing I wish they would improve was the service. I ordered a lot of organic produce. I was amazed at how fast the service went and how fast the checkouts were. I was in and out within a few minutes. The manager was very nice and very helpful."
Food,4.0,CG,House of Tea has hands down the best tea in Reno. The owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is great. I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday. I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service. I've tried a few of the flavors and they all always taste great.
Food,5.0,CG,"This place is wonderful.  We have been going here for years and have always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.   The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is so great.  We go here everyday and we will be back.I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me and I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional for my taste. The flavors are different from the typical ice cream shop ice cream flavors,"
Food,3.5,CG,"The only issue I have with this store is the parking lot.  There is a lot of trash in the parking lot and the rest of the store is not clean.  I go to this store almost every day.  I am always pleased with the service and the selection.  I always get a great deal on the most recent product.  I usually only buy the bread from here because I can buy it at a lot of other stores.  However, when I go to"
Food,3.5,OR,Every time I call or go in there they never have Hyde vapes of any kind. They just don't order enough. Sometimes it can take weeks for them to get a delivery. always have to drive to Collinsville to a different vape shop. Everyone in there is friendly. The shop is nice looking and always clean. But if you don't want to waste your time driving because you need something specific. Call before you go to make sure they have it in stock. It's very disappointing because I want to be able to buy there.
Food,3.0,OR,"Great selection and tasty meats! I went here to get a present for my brother and his girlfriend. I was going to get them 6 Filet Mignons and I had a coupon for 12 free burgers with any purchase. I went in and they accepted my coupon even though it was an online coupon and gave me other great deals as well. I walked out with 12 sesame chicken breasts, a beef stew, 6 Filets and 12 burgers all for under $50! Which is well worth the quality of meat you get. My brother was pleasantly surprised!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Great selection of beers, friendly (but busy) service, and BBQ that smelled great.

Layout is nice - comfortable, not overly crowded.
The menu board displaying the beers is big and easy to read. Untappd geeks like me will appreciate the scrolling list of check-ins at the bottom of the board.
Our server was very helpful, especially for my flight - she put the beers in a good order for drinking, rather than just in the order I called them out.
The BBQ smelled great. Sadly, I wasn't hungry.

Definitely worth a visit, especially if you're tired of the same French Quarter nonsense."
Food,4.5,OR,"Located right on the side of bourbon street, the Fudgery captivated my attention through scent. The smell of the waffles being made drifted out and carried me in.
I have to admit that this place serves the BEST ice cream that I've had in a long time! I think it was a yogurt something- not really sure. My first bites were more than memorable and the whole experience was delightful! If you want to have a really good treat, show the staff the photo of mine and hopefully, they will be able to identify for you! Happy licking!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Great ooogly moogly! My friend who works at Strawberry, brought over a Flourless chocolate cake with layers of ganache for my birthday. The solid oak table, that he placed it on groaned as the table legs buckled. 

I've stated that I'm not a huge sweet and cake fan, but this creation made me a convert. Technically I'd put that cake in the category of candybar. Eating it, there was a fine line between wanting more and wanting to curl up under the table. It was Bill gates rich. 

Score another win for Jean Pierre and Strawberry bakery!"
Food,3.0,OR,"Pay 10% more on top of already high prices!  I don't get the appeal of this store. They claim to mark up 10% because there're buying their products ""at cost.""  That implies they are getting some type of price advantage but they are consistently more expensive than other stores in the area. At least you don't have to boggle your mind with their limited variety and selection.   If you live near Cash Saver it's okay to use it as convenience store.  One thing is certain, you won't save cash at Cash Saver."
Food,4.5,OR,"This is an authentic and huge dollar store. A local recommended it to me, and I saw why as I browsed the aisles, jaw dropped in appreciation of this immense ""Mother of All Dollar Stores.""

They also have grocery items, like a bag of apples and milk for 99 cents each. There are brand name items that a person would actually want to buy, like Speed Stick Deodorant and Martinelli's Sparkling Cider. Some drinks were 79 cents.

Everything here is actually 99 cents or less. This is a good place to know about if you live in the area."
Food,4.0,OR,"Went here with my daughter for a coffee and dessert. I was not impressed. My americano did not taste like coffee and the chocolate cheesecake was missing any resemblance of the ""cheese"" cake. There was so much frosting that even the kids didn't want the leftovers. My daughter had a tea that was just ok and a cupcake that was meh. It was so loud carrying a conversation was difficult. Both desserts tasted like they had been frozen before. Too bad, I thought this place looked so good, but alas."
Food,2.0,CG,"Eh, this Starbucks is hit or miss, the drive thru is always backed up, the person working the drive thru is always super nice, and the drive through is always fast. I go here almost daily and it's usually a long wait. There are also plenty of tables and chairs for people to sit. I also love the fact that they are open until 11pm everyday. I also love that they have a coffee shop nearby. I'm always in and out quick, and I'm"
Food,3.5,CG,My boyfriend and I had a sweet tooth craving and decided to try this place out. We ordered the Strawberry Lemonade and the Cherry Apple. The Strawberry Lemonade was so yummy and refreshing. The Strawberry Lemonade was good too. The Lemonade was very creamy and flavorful. The Strawberry Lemonade tasted great! I will definitely be back.I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and was not disappointed! I chose the cake for my husband's birthday party and it was absolutely delicious
Food,4.5,CG,"A pleasant way to kill time. The only downside is that it's close to the park and we have yet to find a spot, but that is okay if you're a local. We'll be back soon.The best ice cream ever! I love the flavor combinations. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. I recommend checking them out!I came here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised! I got the salted caramel and it was a perfect combination of sweet and"
Food,3.5,CG,"Soo good. A little pricey. But it's a good value for a cup of coffee.Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude. She was rude and rude.  I will never shop here again.I was in the area for a few weeks and was craving ice cream and I had to try it. I've heard great things about this place, so I decided to try it. It was like a good ice"
Food,2.5,CG,"Came here with my bf and I had the best experience. The first time I came here he ordered a 6 pack of the bourbon, which he said was a great deal. I went back to the register and the cashier said he was working on it and he was waiting on me. We were looking at each other and it seemed like he was busy on the register. I asked if he was doing anything about it and he said yes. He then told me that I had"
Food,2.0,CG,"Wonderful employees! Super helpful! 
And the flavors are amazing! 

I also really appreciate their cupcakes (which I had a friend request for) and the flavor of the day. I'm so excited to have found this place in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe. I love the vintage chairs and the old school decor. They have a great selection of cheeses and meats. They have a nice selection of wine and beer."
Food,4.0,CG,"Most all Save-On's are fairly priced. The quality and quality of the produce is just the same as the other locations. 

Their produce is also pretty good, and it's pretty much the same as any other store. I've been to some locations with better quality and cheaper produce, and this one is a close second. I'm not sure if it's due to the proximity of one of the other stores, or if it's just a one-off, but"
Food,4.0,CG,"What a great experience I had. The owner was very knowledgeable about the wines and the local breweries. We had a very good time, and will definitely be back. This place is amazing! I came here on a Saturday night and it was absolutely packed. I got the white chocolate raspberry with berry jam and my boyfriend got the red velvet. Both were great. I wish I could remember the name of the cake I got there and the cake was so moist and delicious."
Food,4.5,CG,My daughter and I had a sweet tooth and we decided to try this place out. We ordered the Strawberry Lemonade and the Cherry Apple. The Strawberry Lemonade was so yummy and refreshing. The Strawberry Lemonade was good too. The Lemonade was very creamy and the crust was perfectly chewy. The Strawberry Apple was refreshing and the Lemonade was smooth. The Lemonade was perfect for my daughter's birthday. We will definitely be returning. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone
Food,4.0,CG,"This place is my new go to place for ice cream. My husband and I have been coming here since we moved to the area, and they have the best ice cream anywhere. The flavors are always changing and change. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. The only thing I have noticed is that they are more than happy to answer any questions you have about their ice cream. They will make recommendations based on what you like. I love their waffle cones, which are so creamy and"
Food,4.5,CG,"Cork & Cracker is pretty good. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever meet. They are rude and will not help you find anything. This is why I'm giving them 5 stars.I love this place!  I love the fact that it is a little far from my home, but I can still get a few things.  I like that they have a"
Food,4.5,OR,"The emperors new clothes. Didn't like the first two flavors I tried, so I got the mint ice cream on dark choc cookie sandwich. It was tasty enough, but nothing very special. The flavors I didn't like were a cherry something and a blueberry something. Neither tasted like fresh fruit... the flavors were kind of muddy. My husband got the dark choc with cherries. It was bitter (not good choc bitter either)and sour , but no taste of cherry at all.  If you want great ice cream go to Whole Foods and buy a pint of jenni's."
Food,4.5,OR,I have been here a couple times. Both times here it was for a class. The first time I learned how to make mozzarella and ricotta cheese. This time that I went I learned how to make sourdough bread and took home a sourdough starter. My parents come here all the time for wine making supplies. Every time I have been here it has been very busy. I learned a lot in both classes and both were fun. This time I also picked up a couple of books. I look forward to taking more classes at this facility.
Food,3.5,OR,"This bakery has some of the best gluten free and vegan cupcakes I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. That is right; gluten free AND vegan, and almost as many fun flavors (a full dozen) as the non vegan/gluten filled ones. Some were more moist than others, but along with some water, tea or almond milk back at the house, they were all truly delicious. I can't wait to visit Indy again and maybe order a special cake for an event. Also, they have fun rings to adorn your cupcake crusted fingers as well; a nice touch!"
Food,3.0,OR,"I am not one to complain about my grocery store experiences, but this one deserves it. The cashier bagged the elderly lady's grocery in front of us and then proceeded to let her take each bag off the bag carousel by herself while she started our order and started to bag our stuff. And then didn't ask for our bonus card or coupons. When asked about it, ""you can go up front if you want that taken off"". Then the customer service representative ripped the survey off the bottom of the receipt when we mentioned the poor service."
Food,2.5,OR,I used to go here for donuts for church and I really liked the fact that they had a card that they punched for each dozen you purchased. When the card was full you got a free dozen . I saved my rewards cards and I had filled 2 so I was eligible for 2 free dozen. When I went to get my donuts they said they no longer accepted the rewards cards.  I was shocked since there was no expiration date on the cards. So I will never go back because that was really bad business!!!!
Food,3.0,OR,"They went from a small but general purpose stop where you could always get a relatively inexpensive quick bite and coffee to a more specialized, more expensive coffee shop. I stopped in every so often for a muffin or even more rarely for a frozen drink, but I was no longer a regular. 

Dunkin Donuts always serves fresh donuts. The muffins and now sandwiches are great for fast and seem to be on the healthier side for fast food. 

I'm so excited to see how far DD has come over the years. I recommend this place to everyone!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Nice place, my family and I went there to celebrate my husband's birthday. The beer was good, but not the best we have had. On the plus side the food was terrific! The burgers are better than most burger places. The only thing I felt was lacking hence the 4 starts was the service. When my husband was looking for recommendations on the beers, we were handed over the card to choose the beer from. Being that it was our first time there, we were hoping for a little more explanation on the type beer selection they have."
Food,4.0,OR,Stopped by after a subpar dinner at Hal's across the street. Packed on a fri night! Best thing I tasted was the cider (which I don't think is made in-house). Hubby enjoyed their IPA & left with a growler. I didn't like anything well enough to go home with it but look forward to returning to try their hefeweizen soon! Also excited to see they have family friendly kegs & eggs for Colts games! Definitely want to give that a try. Glad they opened this place in Greenwod as there was definitely a hole in the market.
Food,4.5,OR,"I wish I could give them 4 or 5 stars because I loved the atmosphere. The brewery clearly used to be a house back in the day and it's absolutely adorable. The indoor rooms could seat probably 30 people. The patio could fit nearly double that. String lights set the ambiance along with a relaxing view of the lake. You can bring your own food in which is great since they only had one food truck. Flights include 4 beer samples for $10. I didn't find any samples that I liked, but it was overall a good experience."
Food,4.5,OR,This place is a must in Tucson! The ice cream was delicious. I ordered a flight and really recommend that. Its the perfect sample size of each flavor. They have many flavors including many that are very unique. It is definitely some of the best ice cream I've ever eaten! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service was not phenomenal. The guy who helped me made it seem like I was an inconvenience to him. He was not friendly. I would not let that deter you from eating their ice cream though!
Food,4.0,OR,"I consider bagels a food group, so I was pretty excited that a bagel store opened in philly. I finally got to check this place out recently. I got a everything bagel (my go to), I was soo disappointed.

The bagels are on the small side, which can be a good thing if you are watching calories. But, the bagel I got seemed over cooked, to the point of being almost burnt. The bagel was too hard and crusty, that I felt I was eating a stale bagel. Hopefully, if I try their bagels again, they will be better."
Food,5.0,CG,I called Rooted Vine and asked if I could pick up a bottle of wine for the wine tasting. I said no. The woman behind the counter said no and then said no. I said no and told her I'd like a glass of wine for the tasting. She said no. Then she gave me a phone number and then I mentioned the phone number and I was so pissed. She didn't want to give me a receipt and asked if I could have a gift card for the wine
Food,2.5,CG,"I'm not saying I'd never go back, but I just don't think that's the way they treat customers.I had a great experience at this location! The customer service was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the flight of 4 different beers and the bartender was very helpful. The beer was great. The place was clean and nicely decorated.

They have a great selection of flavors and toppings for any occasion. I always feel very comfortable here and it"
Food,4.5,CG,"Well worth the drive from Tampa. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the store is a little small. The store itself is small but the employees are nice. I go here with my family and we get a large assortment of things. This store is a great place to buy things.I love this place!  I love the fact that it is a little far from my home, but I can still get a few things.  I like that they have a great selection of"
Food,4.0,CG,"I'm going through some serious issues with the pharmacy, which is a lot of work. I'm going to be careful about the people who work at this pharmacy. There are a lot of people with disabilities and they are in a very bad mood. If I had to pick up a prescription, I would have to go to the store and wait in line for 30 minutes to get a prescription. I just went there to pick up a prescription and they didn't have a single one."
Food,3.5,CG,I am a beer geek and have been a long time fan of the Beermaster. The beer is top notch and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I have been going to this brewery for years and will be a regular for years. I love this place. The staff is always friendly and the beer is great. I love the fact that they have a punch card. They have a great patio with games to play and an outdoor area. I always feel comfortable here.
Food,3.5,CG,"I sooooo wanted to love this place, but we decided to go back for a drink and just grab a cup of coffee and some beers.  The place was clean and the staff was nice.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view.  This is a great place for a cold brew.  They have a small outdoor patio and a small area with a bench area.  I was surprised to see they had a few tables.

Food,4.0,CG,"Homemade ice cream and water ice. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the service is terrible. The woman at the counter was very rude and extremely rude.

I was so pissed that she didn't give me the money back. I'm not sure what happened with this, but I don"
Food,3.5,CG,This store is always clean and has the most helpful employees I have ever encountered. I go there to get my groceries and the people working there are always friendly and helpful. They have a nice selection of organic and vegan options. I am always pleased with the service and the quality of the products. They also have a good selection of vegetarian and paleo items. I think they also have a good selection of organic items. I do think that they have some of the best prices for their organic produce
Food,4.0,CG,"So smooth, creamy, and flavorful. It's a little pricey but worth it for a nice treat. I would recommend. I've had the best donuts at the grocery store ever, and it's pretty much the best donut I've ever had. The shop is huge and clean. There's also a huge selection of donuts to choose from, including glazed and maple glazed. I also love the cute little counter with the paper straws to go."
Food,4.5,OR,"My dad is always in the mood for a malt and so as we wandered NOLA, we also had to wander our way to a ice-cream shop. Kilwin's is a southern chain--I've had them in South Carolina. The quality of the ice cream is as good as any and so deserves the highest ratings. However, the interior of this Kilwin's and most of them does not leave room for those who want to linger and enjoy the ice cream inside. There are a few places to sit, but it would be nice to have a bit more leisure places."
Food,4.5,OR,"I emailed and called and left specific details about what I was looking for for my daughter's first birthday. NO response. Ever. It must be nice to ignore customers, I guess they must have too many. Good cupcake shops and bakery's are a dime a dozen now.....adios and I will be sure to tell everyone I know to stay away.
The above was my original review, but one if the owners emailed regarding this and that was unexpected and says a lot about their business practices. Still haven't tried their product but will try again when I have another event."
Food,1.5,OR,"Pharmacy had gotten totally incompetent. My autorefills haven't been done on time for 3 months. If you call to check the status you spend 10 mins going thru the phone prompts then get put on hold and no one ever picks up. If you go in, it's a 15 - minute wait (note the woman on crutches in front of me in the photo) to be told your auto-refilled prescriptions that were supposed to be done yesterday STILL aren't done and won't be for at least 1 1/2 hours. DON'T USE THIS PHARMACY! I'm transferring my prescriptions right now."
Food,2.0,OR,"This place is awful. Poor selection of merchandise, some of which is damaged, at exorbitant prices. One cashier working (if you're lucky), despite long lines. I only went to Hudson News because it's sister store a few shops down, called Essence, had no one working the registers. When the young woman who worked there returned from wherever she had been there was no apology, not even a half-hearted ""Sorry for the wait. "" They sell cans of Cafe du Monde coffee for $13. 99, when you can go to Amazon and order two cans for $17. The shops are disgraceful."
Food,4.0,OR,"Keep in mind that the majority of the teas sold here are flavoured. To be honest, I'm not into flavoured teas much but they do have some other nice blends that I've enjoyed. The best thing about this place is the customer service: it's friendly, helpful and you can literally ask them to take every tea off the shelf to smell and they will let you (at least Katie will). They'll also let you taste a tea you're interested in. 

Yay customer service! OK for quality tea. Not really for those who are looking for rare or single-origin teas."
Food,3.5,OR,"1st, if you like a good taro yogurt and you think you've tasted them all, i highly suggest you give kiwi's version a try; it's simply amazing... tangy tart and buttery sweet. even my very picky the-only-flavor-i-ever-want-is-taro yogurt buddy has given it her seal of approval. 

2nd, if you're not a taro fan, the strawberry-mango combo certainly doesn't disappoint: not too sweet, not too sour.

3rd, i like that it's in a huge plaza with lots of restaurants and an awesome amc theater. and on weekends, it closes late. 

thus, kiwi = sweet end note to a perfect a date."
Food,3.0,OR,"The drinks and the food are the exact same as any other Starbucks that you will find, but the reason why I am even bothering to write this review for a international chain that we all know is because of the service.  The drive thru was extremely quick, the order was right, and the friendliness from the staff (especially Anna) was second to none. 

Keep it up crew!!! I am excited to make you all part of my morning routine now and it's solely because of you all and the customer service you put in day by day."
Food,3.0,OR,"I have watched buddy on tv for years and when I walked by his bakery craving something sweet, I couldn't help but walk inside. I tried the vanilla almond biscotti which was delicious. I also had the Italian rainbow cookie and was utterly disappointed. I didn't like the flavor and it was cut very thin. I have made these cookies myself and they have tasted much better. If I am in the area I would stop by for some biscotti or try a cannoli. I don't think I will be going out of my way to come here though."
Food,3.5,OR,I placed an order with Sweet Charlie's via Grubhub late this evening and noted in the comments that I had a severe nut allergy. I was surprised when I received a call from an employee at the store to ask about my allergy. He offered to have my batch of cookies freshly made due to my allergy despite it being just before closing time. The cookies and milkshakes were delicious and I admire them for going the extra mile. I wish that I could give an extra tip directly to this employee especially in the midst of the pandemic.
Food,4.5,OR,"Bring cash! And be ready to play darts:)

I was here for my birthday party. It is definitely built for hanging out with groups. The set up is extremely simple, but has enough room to move around, play games and chitchat with friends. 

Food: All I can remember was that they offer a lot of interesting pretzel dishes. 

Drinks: It is a brewing company, though I was not sure any of the brewing equipment was working. There is a large range of selection. For someone who knows nothing to beer and brewing, I enjoyed the drink recommended by the bartender."
Food,2.5,OR,"No matter what time of day, there are huge lines, no baggers, and takes forever to get a deli order.  Waiting 45 minutes for deli meat is ridiculous.  Then have to wait another 20 minutes in checkout .  Oh and if you go to the customer service desk and it's past a certain time and the manager is still behind the counter, they tell u to go wait in a line of 5 people deep.  They can't help you even though they are staring right at you.  You wonder why you get this reputation."
Food,3.5,CG,"It's so hard to find a place that does it. I saw a lot of people go here. I think it's a great place to go and have a drink. The staff is nice and the drinks are great. I'm a coffee snob. This is my go to place for coffee. I love this place!  I love the fact that it is a little far from my home, but I can still get a cup of coffee and some work done."
Food,4.0,CG,"If you're a coffee snob, this is the place. I will admit that I'm a regular.

I had the banana, egg and cheese croissant. The croissant was a little hard to chew, but it was moist and flakey. The croissant was a bit too sweet for me. I'm not sure if it was a day of sitting in a cold oven, but I'm sure it was. It was like a good croissant."
Food,4.5,CG,"It's a good one!
I've brought my wife and I here a few times and they have the best cupcakes.  The cookies are the best.  The staff is always so nice and accommodating.  They are always so nice and welcoming.

Food,3.5,CG,Fantastic cupcakes. I tried the vanilla cupcake and it was a nice cupcake. The cupcake was moist and delicious. I also tried the strawberry cupcake. The strawberry cupcake was moist and delicious. The strawberry cupcake was rich and flavorful. I love the cake as a gift to someone. They also offer a variety of specialty cupcakes. They have a few items that you can order online.
Food,4.5,CG,"I'm really digging the rotating selections of flavors. 

I love that they have a couple different flavors so I can try different ones before deciding on the flavor. 

I like that they offer fresh fruit flavors. I've tried their green tea and cinnamon topping. The staff is always friendly. I like that the store has a self-serve yogurt machine so you can get a lot of yogurt! 

I'm really glad they have a drive-thru option for"
Food,4.0,CG,"Went back again.  So happy with the quality and quality of the product.  I was disappointed.   Went back to the store and they said the manager was on duty.  We go to another store and get the same horrible experience.  This store is still great.  I love it.  I love the store and the employees.  If you like your job well done, do not go to this store.  They should get some serious training on customer service. "
Food,2.5,CG,"i love this starbucks location. They have the best coffee in town. 

The staff is always so friendly. 

I love that they have a drive through window.I'm so excited to have found this place in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe. I love the vintage chairs and the old school decor. 

I love the decor and the music is always great. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I like that they have a separate drive"
Food,4.0,CG,My bartender Nick made this a fun and fun night. He was very kind and informative. We had a great time. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The atmosphere was nice and family friendly. It was a great night out. If I'm ever back in Indy again I'll definitely be back!One of the best ice cream places around! I had the caramelized coconut and my husband had the peach ice cream. Both were delicious. Both were perfect! Would definitely recommend!I
Food,4.0,CG,"Oh man, this place makes some of the best ice cream I have ever had. I have never had a gelato that is not so creamy and delicious! I think the place is pretty cool with a small patio and a good view of the river. This place is a must try!This is a great place to go to grab a drink or to meet up with a friend. They have a lot of different options and they have a good selection of wines and beers. I love that they have"
Food,4.5,CG,"I have a friend who has an AIDS and we decided to go to this Walgreens because we had an appointment. The staff was very friendly and the store was clean. I would definitely go again. 

The only negative was that the pharmacy was very busy. The staff seemed to be confused about helping us to the register. 

I would definitely come back here. I just wish there was a bit more seating outside.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes"
Food,2.5,OR,"I have been consistently been met with super bad service every time I have visited this Sam's club location. I normally visit the location closer to my house in Town and Country (which is usually a pretty good experience. The location in Maplewood
 has subpar merchandising standards, demo associates eating the samples and a check out wait of 30 minutes +. The tobacconist had me waiting outside her cage for ten minutes while she finished texting. The only redeeming quality that gave my experience two stars instead of one was the cashier who smiled and said she liked my hair."
Food,2.0,OR,"After a long day at work, coffee can make the rest of your night better. Well that is what I was expecting when I pulled into the drive-thru at this Dunkin' Donuts. What I did receive was a disgusting iced coffee. It was warm and not made how I ordered it. I specifically ordered french vanilla swirl with sugar and cream. The first sip was bland and chunks of sugar were floating around. 

In conclusion, an all around bad experience. This Dunkin' is definitely not up to par with other locations. I would definitely not recommend traveling to this one."
Food,3.0,OR,"I have been a regular customer here for quite a while. Always an amazing staff who are very knowledgeable when it comes to narrowing down what I need & they always offer to help me carry it out to my car.  Check out the great growler selection.  They also go above and beyond - they even ordered a specific beer after I came in asking for it and have kept it in stock ever since!  Lots of local favs as well. Be sure to check out what they have on their ""free tasting Friday"" selections. Highly recommend."
Food,4.0,OR,"Small & efficient Philly grocery spot. Almost always packed but somehow fully stocked. I've found Thursday evenings one of the better times to shop. Super friendly staff. Despite the seeming endless line to check out, it's a pleasant experience with a good flow. The cashiers are always upbeat and talkative. Crew on the floor will stop whatever they are doing to answer questions. I don't know how they do it with all the chaos of ALOT of people shopping in such a small space but they do it well. Great prices and great selection as with all other trader joes."
Food,4.5,OR,"I'm on a work trip and I decided to check out a coffee shop. So I went here before heading into work. I arrived around 8am, totally wasn't expecting to see a crowd.

I ordered the Cuban Iced Coffee - it was perfect. I usually like sweeter drinks. I was worried it wouldn't be sweet enough but it was perfect.

I also ordered the Sunrise Breakfast Burrito. Very flavorful and spicy! Definitely will be back if I'm in the area again. 

The baristas are friendly too! I told her I never been here before and she helped me pick out my order."
Food,4.0,OR,"I have to say the staff was very cordial, but I was not happy with my results what so ever. I purchased Botox on Groupon and then another 10 units when I arrived  and usually after about 10 days used a tremendous difference .  I had no results at all - I've been to numerous locations in the area for Botox -but never ever had 00000 results- It must have been watered down tremendously .  One place I won't go back to. Other services might be fine but I do not recommend Botox what do ever ."
Food,4.0,OR,"How fun to grab a house brewed craft beer, some food and catch a latest movie!

The beers are legit though they always seem to be out of one of the seasonals that I'd like to try.  The food is far better than any other movie theater, but be careful comparing it to the true food scene. It's really top notch considering this is a theater and brewery with food.  

The hummus plate was quite big...enough for sharing!  I had a pizza that was pretty good too.

I'm really interested in the movie events with cult classics periodically playing."
Food,4.0,OR,"A day of estate saleing, a trip to the salvage store for culinary treasures, an adventurous meal from the ideal market. Pictured below are sopa de Rez, tamale con pollo with cream queso sauce, free sliced roasted chicken mexican rice dressing and potato salad sans mustard add carrots, pasta salad, homemade corn tortillas, sweet plantains, Mexican saffron rice and stewed pigs feet. It was eclectic and stretched the bounds of culinary propriety. Why doesn't Dave take me out with him for lunch??? Can u hang with the pigs feet!!?? Only the bold need apply. Living well in the big easy."
Food,3.5,OR,Supervisor lady was very rude. Talked in a demeaning manor as if she didn't want to assist customers and as if I was lying when I went to return a salad kit that was brown and slimy despite being purchased from the store not but two hours before. She claimed it would take up to 15 mins to help me with a return despite it being later at night and the store virtually empty. When we approached her for help she was doing nothing but standing there. Not to mention that the prices are high and the selection being minimal.
Food,2.5,OR,"In order to function as a human being I require coffee. Strong coffee. Starbucks will jolt a horse. I like this. 
A coworker told me about the chestnut praline syrup that has limited availability from now until February. To say I'm in love with this is an understatement. 
If I'm wrong about the February timeline, please tell me since I am now obsessed. No other flavor will satisfy me. 
Drive thru here moves pretty quick. Staff has always been nice and the prices are a touch high. Welcome to Starbucks. Who cares, give me my grande chestnut praline iced coffee!"
Food,4.5,CG,"Literally the best white chocolate ice cream I've ever had. My husband got a vanilla bean and he loved it. We will definitely be back. I'm a fan of this place. I love the flavors and the service. I wish I could get some of their other flavors every time. I have tried the banana split, the strawberry and the strawberry. All of them are good. The strawberry one is a little too sweet. The strawberry one is good, not too sweet."
Food,4.0,CG,"I've been here twice now and both times the food is good. 

The first time I went, I had the Chicken wings.  The chicken was okay. The chicken was ok. The chicken was not fresh. I would have liked to have brought the wings back home. 

The second time I went, I got the chicken wings with fries and they were great. I was hoping for something different.

Food,2.0,CG,I have to get my prescriptions here and they are usually out of things that I need. The other day I had to get a script that was the wrong one. I went to pick it up and the pharmacist said it was wrong. I went to the pharmacy counter and they gave me the wrong one and gave me a different one and gave me a different one. I called the pharmacy and they said they would call me and they would call me back.
Food,4.0,CG,"Nearly a yearly patron of this place, I'd say I will be going back for more!Great coffee and great people! I am a coffee snob and have had great coffee and pastries here. The staff is always friendly and the service is excellent. The staff is always willing to answer any questions I have. I can't wait to come back!I love this place. It's right next to the train tracks. It's like a perfect summer day."
Food,4.5,CG,"I have to love any of the locally sourced produce and the prices are fair. I have purchased their produce from local farmers and am not a fan of the produce, so it is pretty expensive. They have everything from fresh cut veggies, beans, jams, candy, to flowers. You can always find a great selection of organic and vegetarian options. There is a nice selection of breads, breads, etc. I love the fact that they have some of the most unique coffee varieties that I have seen"
Food,3.5,CG,"True to the store's name, this store is the worst. I will never shop here again. If you go to this store, you will be told by the manager ""you are closed."" The store manager is rude and will not help you. I have never been to this store before. I will not be returning to this store. I will never be shopping at this store again.I will say I went there with my sister for the first time and I have a hard time deciding on what to"
Food,3.0,CG,"Last time I went here, it was the worst. I waited 30 mins for the person to come up and tell me to leave, and they said the manager was on duty. I was told to leave and go to the next store. I told the man to leave. The manager said ""I'm sorry"". I said ""no, I'll leave you with a paper bag."" He said ""I don't have paper bags"". The manager told me that I couldn't buy bags from the store,"
Food,2.5,CG,"This is a fun *little* ice cream shop with lots of unique flavors. There is a large selection of flavors and toppings to choose from. I got the Nutella and the Sweet Cream. It was really good, but I can't imagine it being as creamy as I would like. The sweet cream was the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. I think the sweet cream could be just a bit sweeter. I will be back to try other flavors."
Food,4.5,CG,A friend took me to this place and let me tell you it was my favorite! I ordered the Strawberry shortcake and it was so delicious and the icing was soooooo cute! The cake was so moist and moist! I will definitely be coming back and trying the other flavors! I love the cake and the fruit! I will definitely be coming back!

The location is a little weird for me because it"
Food,2.0,CG,"If I could give this location an A+, I would. The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. The only thing I wish they would improve was the service. I ordered a double espresso and a double espresso with soy milk. I got the double espresso with soy milk and it was very good. It was very bitter and bitter. The coffee was watered down and the espresso tasted like water."
Food,4.5,OR,"I came here for an event around the Christmas holiday and it was a 10$ donation to a Cat Rescue and it was well worth it. The brewery was open to walk around in, they had food and lots of brew. For the first time trying their beer I have to say it was awesome! Being from Philadelphia and coming to your local brewery is something amazing! I would definitely like to come here to tour the brewery and get some beer or a growler from them! I can't wait till they have another event because I will surely be there!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Really delicious ice cream parlor! You can always tell a difference between store bought and parlor ice cream. 

The cones cost a lot more here and make a single scoop almost $8, a bit pricey honestly. 

The atmosphere is quaint and relaxing. They often have live music out back in the patio with seating. The front porch has chairs to relax and enjoy the brick road scenery. 

Neat place and worth trying out, just a bit on the expensive side but then again it's Zionsville and not a DQ. 

Check them out for some delicious flavors and great homemade waffle cones!"
Food,5.0,OR,"Everyone here is so nice. We got their pudding and a little cupcake once which were both delicious. We also got a large (20 people) custom buttercream birthday cake for our baby's 1st birthday and couldn't have been more pleased. The cake was fun and beautiful and soooooo yummy. I ate it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for several days. They're so easy to work with. I never had to stress about the cake. We also bought separate cake toppers from Amazon and the bakery incorporated them so nicely into the cake. We will see them for our next bday cake!"
Food,3.0,OR,"Worst gas station attached to this BJ's. Credit only, no cash accepted. Long wait to get our turn and the attendant was very put out to serve us. She appeared visibly annoyed when we answered, Yes we would like a receipt, when she asked. Took her time to walk across the lot and came back to hand us a blank receipt...nothing on it and she hadn't looked at it before walking it over. We asked for a new copy and waited another 5 minutes to be told by a different attendant, We can't print a receipt for you. Won't be back."
Food,5.0,OR,"SO happy that Korshak finally has their brick and mortar spot in South Philly. I happily pre-ordered online during the week for a Saturday morning pick-up. When I arrived, my order was ready to roll and the staff were super attentive. The bagels were absolutely delicious - toasted on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside. We have been missing these bagels in Philly for way too long. Tried a variety of bagel and schmear flavors, and were so pleased with all of them. This is definitely our new bagel spot and absolutely worth the 20 min. ride from East Kensington."
Food,2.0,OR,"ZERO STARS FOR THE LIQUOR STORE. I just now stopped in to buy a few things. Two 65 and  up ladies working the register together. I check out. They are GABING the whole time. They don't make eye contact with me at all. I pay I leave and not one word. Not one glance. Was I even there lol? I was against self check out. Not anymore. I get it now, why you might as well check out yourself. Scan and Ho. 
These ladies were worthless 
I'm adding a photo of the receipt it important to have proof theses days."
Food,3.5,OR,"Kinda hidden off Howard ave. They have a primo location, since the next nearest smoothie place is on Dale Mabry. 

I wasn't aware of the skinny option, but I definitely asked him not to add as much sugar to my smoothie. It is always too sweet, as it was this time. I always feel bad about not tipping, although it is really not necessary at these places but I took my drink and ran. I gave the drink to my boyfriend who has more of a sweet tooth. They need a Jamba Juice in south Tampa. No Smoothie King for me."
Food,3.5,OR,"Store is poorly stocked most of the time. Items incorrectly labeled. Management could use a lesson in how to treat customers. Simple question about return policy was asked and the manager working (woman with blonde/brunette hair and glasses) would not simply answer. She immediately wanted to argue. Once we realized that she was not going to answer us and decided it was time to go, she followed us, determined to get the last word. Three people came in during this and left immediately. They said if she's working, they drive a little further to the other Target or go to Walmart"
Food,3.0,OR,"I went in search of some ginger-ale to soothe my upset stomach.  Instead, I found the highly recommended peach ginger tea.  I heard one of the clerks say she drinks hers cold.  I got mine hot.  It was suggested I sweeten it with honey and add lemon (They have packets of lemon juice).  I could have done without the lemon.  Next to this kiosk there are rocking chairs.  Sipping warm peach tea in a rocking chair while waiting for my ride definitely made me feel like my Tennessee vacation was already in full swing!"
Food,3.5,OR,"I really enjoyed the wine tasting event where I felt I learned a few new things both about wines in general and also about the history of the winery and business focus itself. The ""educator"" or talking host was very knowledgeable about Chadds Ford winery and wines in general and gladly took questions. I liked about half of the wines in the tasting, but I'm more a fan of reds and it was August, so they would be more prevalent in the fall and winter. Enjoyed the wine shop as well which had a nice assortment of wines available for purchase."
Food,4.5,OR,"If you find yourself in the French Quarter and want some strong, delicious coffee to go, this is a wonderful bet. A place where you can camp out in the AC, use the bathroom, and rest your old dogs, this is not. I stopped by when I needed some iced coffee in the summer mid-day heat and opted for some cold brew to go. Though I've heard the espresso is also delicious! And if you're into more than one kind of option per coffee type (think blends, origins), this is also a good choice! Support a local business and stop in!"
Food,4.5,CG,We love coming here to grab a beer and wine. I always love that they have a full bar area so you can enjoy the view. I love the place and especially love that they have a few tables outside which is nice. I love how they have a few tables outside and a few tables outside. I haven't had a problem finding a seat since they opened. They have a great patio with a few tables outside and they have some cool games to play.
Food,4.0,CG,"This is a must on the Pinellas trail. I will admit that I was a bit nervous about the summer heat, but I was able to get out of the heat and go inside to enjoy my ice cream in the shade. The shop is tucked away in a industrial park, with a small patio and a few tables and chairs. 

They have a lot of flavors, but I went with the honeycomb, it was really good. It was a great balance of sweet and salty, with"
Food,2.5,CG,"Is this save-a-lot? Multiple times, it's been very frustrating.

The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the bakery itself is very small, and the inside is very small. I came in to pick up a few dozen cake pops for my daughter's birthday. The staff seemed to be confused about how to order them, which was weird because they were out of them all. I was quite surprised to see that there was no one in the shop at the time so I"
Food,4.5,CG,"Here are some interesting things that caught my eye when I was in Reno, and I was pretty impressed. 

First, the ice cream is homemade and tasty. The waffle cones are a little hard to get to, but they are very generous with portions. There are also a couple of tables outside with a fire pit, which is great for a hot day. I got a scoop of the chocolate peanut butter ice cream and it was very good. It's very rich, and it's very rich"

Food,4.0,CG,My go to place when I need something sweet and just want a cup of coffee. I just can't get over the deliciousness of their coffee and the flavor of their drinks.

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is bright and open.

I ordered the Taro milk tea with bubbles and it was delicious. It was a little pricey for the amount of bubbles, but it was definitely worth it. The place itself is clean and modern. 

They also offer a variety of specialty drinks. I had the peach green tea with bubbles. It was very refreshing and very refreshing. The mango green tea is"
Food,4.0,OR,"Great place, very modern. I like the choices of food items and beverages, it was well thought. Great sitting spaces, the concept is absolutely fantastic, with the clients in mind. You can pick from a very intimate, romantic corner to a more casual stool sitting by the bar area. Not sure about the charm of their live singers, they can be truly annoying if they are singing for a long time, which is usually the case. Heavy metal by the end of the day? That is a ""no-no"", please! Other than that, this is quite an interesting place to meet and relax."
Food,4.5,OR,"New Orleans is home to some of the best local brew out there, and while I can't say each one is my favorite, I do have many; French Truck is somewhere at the top of that list. The coffee is always consistent and so so fresh. I believe they use Gracious Bakery for some of their baked offerings and I love that...NOLA embraces supporting local like no other.

I've had all sorts of drinks at FT but none so delicious as their Oji drip coffee. It's darker than my soul and will have you bouncing right out the door with the first sip!"
Food,3.5,OR,"Cheaper than Whole Foods and nicer than Winn Dixie but every few times we go there they overcharge us for something. Once they charged us $1.50 per potato instead of per pound. On several occasions things marked on sale rang up at the original price. Once they rang up cucumbers as broccoli, tripling the cost. So unless you enjoy donating money to a supermarket you have to either watch everything as it gets rung up or closely review your receipt. If you point out the mistake they will give you cash back at the customer service desk but oddly they never apologize..."
Food,5.0,OR,This place is awesome!!  It's located in a commercial area in an old brick building/warehouse which totally adds to its charm.  The guys working there the day we went in we're super nice and friendly.  They helped me (non-whiskey drinker) pick out a bottle of whiskey for my husband (whiskey lover).  They were patient and answered all of my questions.  I wished we had more time as I would have liked to stay for a standing.  Super sad they don't ship to Arizona yet but hopefully soon since my husband is in love with their whiskey.
Food,4.0,OR,"My boyfriend and I were visiting SB from Orange County and wanted try some of the local wines. We started at Kunin Wines and tried several spots after that. Kunin, hands down, was our best experience. There was room for us to sit at the bar and one of the staff, Robbie, made our whole visit. He spent time answering all of our novice questions and was so knowledgeable about the wine and wine in general. The price was very reasonable and we loved that you could do all white or all red. We will definitely be back on our next visit."
Food,4.0,OR,This is a must try when in Philly. The line is outrageously long at times but the ice cream is sooooo worth it. I was in town only one night but I went back for seconds. There are too many words that come to mind when describing the delicious goodness of the ice cream to put in this short review. So just get in line and experience it for yourself. The caramel banana ice cream was to die for. The whipped cream must have rainbows in it therefore put it on whatever you get.
Food,4.0,OR,"I am sooo disappointed!  I bought several Merb's caramel apples at Straub's in Clayton fully anticipating the wonderful creamy sweetness of past years. The caramel tasted quite different than usual. It was a much thinner coating, The buttery/creamy taste was absent. The pecans were fewer and the overall taste lacked the sweetness and richness it usually has. Merb's, I know times are tough, but being cheap with the ingredients means that those of us who have been buying your apples for over 40 years will leave for Bobby's Caramel Apples! Reverse course and raise the price to pay for the ingredients!"

then the cashier said I'm done I'm not going to take anymore customers, and when I told him I was waiting he respond to me very mean and with disrespect, I asked him what your name he answered David, and what your last name I don't have to tell you. 

I don't know what kind of training these employees get"
Food,4.5,OR,"Coffee was pretty average, I ordered a meil.  Maybe next time I would order it a little sweeter. 

Atmosphere was really nice.  It was cozy inside despite the fact that they were busy! It felt like a great local spot to catch up with friends, work on a project, or just relax with a cup of coffee.  

The staff were so kind.  Before we left the asked how everything tasted, and if we enjoyed the time spent together. It felt like they care about making a community with their customers and giving them a place to come together."
Food,4.5,CG,"We're lucky that we can go to the market and try all the different flavors. I was pretty disappointed that we didn't try the pumpkin ice cream but the flavor was good. I would definitely go again.

Food,4.0,CG,"I've never been more baffled than a little. We were also amazed at how awesome the decor is. The place is a bit small, but the inside is very large and cozy. We got a coffee and some chocolate and a croissant. We both ordered the chocolate croissant and the almond croissant. Both were great. We will definitely be back to try more of their pastries and coffee."
Food,4.5,CG,"Apparently another Philly staple that has caught my eye on. I will admit that I have been a frequent visitor to this location for years, but since then, I have had a difficult time deciding what to order. It's a fairly new location, but it's always clean and well stocked.

I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service. I've tried a few of the coffee and they all always taste great. The drive thru is always fast and
Food,4.5,CG,Very fresh donuts with an amazing variety of flavors.  I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in at around 3:15pm and they had a sign on the door saying that it was closed. It was not.  The store was dirty and the employees were very rude.  They were rude to the customers and also made me feel uncomfortable.  I will never go back to this place.  I will not go to this location.I always feel very welcome when I come to this Target
Food,4.0,CG,"The coffee was really good, and the atmosphere was very relaxing. 

The only thing I would suggest would be to get a table to sit outside if you're a coffee connoisseur.  It was a little pricey for a coffee shop, but it was worth it.  They also sell a variety of pastries, and I think they are a little pricier than other coffee shops.  I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good coffee shop.I've been to this store"
Food,4.5,OR,"I came here for the ice cream. I ordered the Black Raspberry in a sugar cone. The flavor was quite good. There was an intense raspberry flavor blended into a creamy and sugary ice cream. 

I was disappointed with the mouthfeel. There were noticeable ice crystals in the ice cream. It was hard to discern if these were in the raspberry or the ice cream itself. Either way, the texture was far from ideal. My friend got a non-fruit version which appeared much smoother. 

I'd steer clear of the fruit ice cream. The flavor was nice, but the texture was only just OK."
Food,3.5,OR,"I'm so happy we finally got a Superstore near downtown! It is my favourite grocery store, particularly for non-perishables. Their prices are good, probably some of the best in town. I know some people don't like bagging their own groceries, but I am kind of maybe a bit OCD about how my groceries are bagged, so I prefer doing it myself anyways. Although I usually go through self checkout... 

My main complaint is that service is hard to come by if you need help. I buy clothes here sometimes, and you often have to search around for someone to open a change room."
Food,4.0,OR,"Absolutely the best Starbucks I have ever been to in my life. The friendliest and cleverest staff on the face of the earth. My drink (a very complicated misto with three flavors and velvety soy foam) has never been wrong. 
If you have a choice between here and wawa, it's worth the extra dollar and the slightly higher caffeine content. I run into someone I know from the neighborhood most times I come in, and even people I don't know are friendly company when waiting for my beverage. 
Great place to feel welcome. Some of the staff veterans remembered me years between visits."
Food,3.0,OR,"Hard to beat the outstanding customer service here at our local Kroger.  All of the employees are sooo nice!  There is a nice selection of organic products, which are my favorites.  This visit all of the produce appeared to be fresh.  They are continually checking and removing any that are not fresh.  The Deli has a very nice selection of meats and cheeses.  Significant savings can be had by taking advantage of the weekly specials.  There are also food bars available with a nice selection.  One can also have a fresh plate or sandwich made."
Food,4.5,OR,"Visiting friends and family for New Years Eve- we spotted this new brewery near where we used to live and decided to give them a try. They do 5 oz pours for $2 each for as many as you want to try~ we tried a bunch. Least favorite Pep in your step~ everyone at the table sipped off mine and none of us liked it. Favorites were the stouts and the ginger-brown! So, I liked a few :) Service was spot on~ everyone had a friendly disposition. Great atmosphere. I would recommend this one for your brewery tour through the Tampa Bay Area!"
Food,3.0,OR,"This is the most convenient Starbucks for me on my commute. 

My biggest complaint - and this is specific to the brand not this location - is that the cups leak from where the lid and the lip of the cup meet. My $2 coffee should not leak. I never have this issue with Wawa coffee, but ever other cup of Starbucks I get drips everywhere. Why?

As for this location - work on your employee morale. Everyone there seems miserable. Staff rarely smiles and service is not prompt. If there is a line, no matter how
Many people are working, you're going to wait."
Food,3.0,OR,"Id give then no stars if I could. I ordered custom fortune cookies for a surprise pregnancy announcement. When I went to track the order 4 days later, it was not there. I called the company and talked to the receptionist. She said she called me and sent me an email, saying she couldn't send the order because in order to, she needed to charge me an additional $35 for separating Aunt, Uncle, Grandma and Grandpa. 

Those emails/phone calls never existed. She said she was going to cancel my order right away. Why not send them overnight instead?

Horrible customer service and business tactics."
Food,1.5,OR,"Walmart stores have great deals and product but there employees are the worst. RUDE!!! I don't think they would know customer service if it smacked them in their faces. I was there today to buy two things, I landed up spending over $100. I bought alot of stuff. The cashier at lane 7,  I think her name was Amber truly was the worst. She had an attitude from the start, she rand an item wrong and when I let her know she told me I was wrong under her breath. Will not be shopping here anytime soon. I will be at Target."
Food,5.0,OR,"Corsair Distillery was definitely an amazing tour which was only a whopping 8 bucks per person. The host of the tour was extremely knowledgeable, passionate and friendly. The tour is detailed so you will be able to witness the beginning and end process of a good cup of whisky. There are so many unique flavors including a flavor referred to as a Chocolate Tsunami. If you are part of the tour you can also get a cool Whisky Glass at the price of 2 bucks. Also in the lobby area you can hang out drink and play some Mario Kart."
Food,4.0,OR,"If you're looking for a relaxing wine tasting with a chill vibe then this is the place! We came during COVID on a Monday and they had plenty of open tables and they were spaced out appropriately.

The service was really great and they were very attentive and friendly! We tried pretty much every red they had as well as both of the chardonnays and rose! The red blends were so great and the Jetty red blend had a great sweet jammy flavor- definitely a favorite of the reds! 

This place is great for a lowkey wine tasting without being too boujee, highly recommend!"
Food,1.5,CG,"Like some others here, I find it difficult to find parking. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the staff is very friendly, and the store is very clean. The store is in a very nice part of town, and is very well organized. I love that they have a Starbucks inside and out, and the parking lot is a little tight. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick cup of coffee or to study."
Food,4.5,CG,"Let me tell you! I'm not a huge fan of chocolate but this was my first time ordering one. I ordered the raspberry and the raspberry. The raspberry was light, not too sweet and the raspberry was a little tart. The raspberry was very moist. My boyfriend got the chocolate peanut butter one and it was pretty good. I could have eaten the peanut butter one but I was really disappointed. I just went with the strawberry and the chocolate peanut butter one. Both were good, not worth the price."
Food,4.5,CG,"I asked the cashier if she could make an ice cream sandwich and she said yes! So she asked for a cup of coffee. She handed me the cup and said ""no"". So I go to the register and order. I'm told it's frozen and I'm waiting for the cashier to finish making my sandwich. I get a ""I'm not sure"" and she says ""oh my god, I'm sorry"" and that's what I said. I said ""you can't do that"" and"
Food,4.0,CG,"Nice product line BUT the ice cream is amazing!  I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do, and when I asked her to repeat it she was rude and condescending.  I will never go back.I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and was not disappointed! I chose the cake for my husband's birthday party, and the cake was absolutely delicious! My husband's"
Food,4.5,CG,"Really cool Brewery/Tasting room, but not a whole lot of seating.

The beer was decent, but a little too hoppy for my taste. The porter was solid, and it was a bit too hoppy for me. 

I would come back to try their other beers and hang out here again. I'd also suggest getting a growler to go.I love this place. It's right next to the train station. It's like a perfect stop for a sweet treat."
Food,4.5,CG,We've been meaning to visit this place since they opened. I'm not sure if the owner has changed since then but the staff are always friendly and accommodating. I think the place is pretty cool with a lot of potential. The beer is always great. I love the stout. The staff is always friendly. I have also tried the orange saison. I think I haven't had one of those before but I guess I'll try it out.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite
Food,4.0,CG,We went and got the strawberry banana and the chocolate. I got a cup of the strawberry banana. It was delicious. The banana was a bit too sweet for me. The chocolate was thick and creamy. The strawberry banana was a bit too sweet for my liking. I would definitely go back if I'm in the area.They are always busy but the staff is always so friendly. They make my drinks right! I love the atmosphere and the location. I always feel welcome here.I've been to this store a
Food,3.0,CG,"I needed a treat to eat. The owner and her husband were so kind and the customer service was outstanding. The cookies were delicious, and the kids enjoyed them. Will definitely be back!The customer service is excellent.  I am from Seattle and I come to Starbucks often.  I always get a great drink, the baristas are always friendly and helpful.  I like the location of this Starbucks, it's a little bit on the pricier side, but I prefer to drive the extra mile to get a"
Food,4.0,OR,"A staple within Philly's Reading Terminal, whenever I eat their ice cream I'm overwhelmed with nostalgia because I remember coming here with my grandmother when I was a kid. That says a lot, because it still tastes exactly the same!

I always get the pralines and cream or the cookies and cream, this time I got both and the serving was huge but it was still considered a single. For $5 (tax included), the portions are really generous compared to like Haagen Das. The line is always long, especially in summer but it moves quickly.

If you're ever in the area, give it a try :-)"
Food,4.5,OR,"As other reviewers have stated, Arnie's is simply the best place for meats, precooked dinners, and more. 

So far I've enjoyed the:
Prime Filet- perfect every time
Meatball mix- beef, veal and pork
Pork sausage
Chicken Meatballs & Turkey Sausage- If you're not into red meats these are a great option
Twice Baked Potato- simply delicious
Mushrooms- not usually my thing, but I even liked these
Breads: Ciabatta rolls, Italian loaf

My mom also recommends the broccoli rabe, chicken salad, fresh mozzarella, parmesan reggiano, prepared salmon with apricot glaze

There are a lot of other food items at Arnie's that I haven't tried yet, but they all look great and I eventually will."
Food,4.0,OR,Bought 2 of each flavor. These cupcakes are hands down best in Tampa. Beautiful and flavorful. I tried so far the canoli crumbulee and champagne pear. These all were incredible. I can't wait to try the others. I've got family in town and they were so excited when I showed them these cupcakes. The bad reviews must be from competitors or people with anamosity towards people working there. The cupcakes are out of this world!!!! The owner was friendly and because I bought so many gavr me a good deal on a cupcake headband I bought for my niece. Loveeeee this wonderful cupcake shop!!!!
Food,4.5,OR,"Love. Love. Love this spot. Bakery is in the name so I tried the deserts and pastries first. The Japanese Cheesecake has become a favorite treat for my whole family. It is such a lovely texture, not too sweet and not too heavy. And the crepe cakes and absolutely outstanding. I've had the green tea and the chocolate hazelnut. Both were so delicious with the right amount of pastry cream. What I wasn't expecting was to like their noodles and dim sum so much. Their veggie dumplings are delicious. I enjoy trying new things when we go. The chicken noodles have become another favorite."
Food,3.0,OR,"Haven't done much grocery shopping here, but heard about the new bottle shop and decided to check it out on a Friday night.  It's open late, which is great, and is much larger than I expected. There's a limited selection of refrigerated beers, but there's a couple rows of shelves stocked with all sorts of craft brews, and there's both room temp and cold singles so you can mix and match your own 6 pack. 

I'll never understand the crazy PA liquor laws, but I'm quite content they allow me to pick up beer at the grocery store - I'll definitely be back."
Food,4.0,OR,"Would recommend the granola, wouldn't recommend the bagel. Expensive and store bought. However, I'm definitely going to come here more for the ambience. I usually cannot do coffee shop noise level even for work but I got a great amount of work done alongside the bottomless coffee mug  that I purchased. The residential neighborhood makes a great location because it's not super busy (or at least when I went on a wednesday morning). The coffee was great, the service was great, food was mediocre, but the eccentric and whimsical decor has charmed me to make this one of my new favorite places already."
Food,5.0,OR,"Great new beer distributor in Ambler. Very big, very well-organized. Lots of cold cases and a great selection of domestics, craft, and imports. Prices are pretty good and the place is clean. 

Bought a case of craft beer recently that was well past it's ""best by"" date which ironically enough was 5 months before the place opened. Not sure how that happened - I blame the brewery. But the staff was very understanding and accommodating and allowed me to exchange it, so I was happy to get an even more expensive case. 

Overall - awesome place. Great selection, clean, well-organized, and great customer service!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Seriously, while I won't argue that the pinnacle of healthy eating is Whole Foods, it can get pricy. That being said, Trader Joe's is all the awesome of Whole Foods without the whole paycheck. The staff here is always so nice and ready to help. And the product, oh the product. We always get gyoza, mushroom alfredo and chicken alfredo every time we shop. Their prices on dry pasta, 99 cents, can't be beat and they have a variety of tasty items for packing in lunches.

As a cheese head, I can also say that while their selection is not huge, it is amazingly delicious."
Food,4.0,CG,"Cupcakes were decent, seems like a little more expensive than other places in town, but I would say the cupcakes are very good. The icing is also pretty good, so it's not that it's a little too much icing on the cake. I would say that the cupcakes are also pretty good. I liked the cake flavor, but the frosting on the icing was really bad. I just went with the red velvet cake and the chocolate raspberry. Both were good, but I would not go out of"
Food,5.0,CG,"If you want a special treat, you can order a variety of cupcakes for the person you are with. The woman at the counter was very friendly and offered to make a special occasion for us. We ended up getting a large cupcake for our dogs and our pup. The cupcakes were a bit too sweet for my taste, but the cupcakes were tasty and so was the cupcakes. The cupcakes were a little dry for my liking, but that's not a problem."
Food,4.0,CG,"If you're planning a party, this is the place. I saw a lot of people go here. It's not the best place for cakes, but the cake is pretty good.I'm not sure why this place has such a bad rating. I ordered a vanilla latte and it was cold. The barista was rude and condescending. I ordered a coffee and they said they could make a decaf coffee. I was not able to get it and it was very watery. I paid for it and left"
Food,4.0,CG,I actually stopped in here last night and the girl behind the counter was super sweet! I ordered the Strawberry shortcake and it was delicious. The strawberry shortcake was sooooooo good! I also had the strawberry shortcake which was very moist. My boyfriend got the strawberry shortcake and it was so good! I will definitely be back and I hope to try out their other flavors!We had such a great time here! We were on a road trip and needed a coffee place to stop for a few hours before the
Food,3.5,CG,New ownership bad news! Went here on the weekend and decided to try it out. I was pretty disappointed. The ice cream is very thick and creamy and the flavor was not great. The milkshakes were okay. The ice cream was very thick. My boyfriend got the chocolate peanut butter with cream. It was very good and it had a very weird aftertaste. It was also very hard to eat. The ice cream itself was ok. The service was a little slow for me. I'd recommend this place for
Food,4.5,CG,"Another great addition of breweries in the area. Great beer selection, friendly staff, and a pretty good atmosphere. Great place to hang out. 

I'll be back soon!The best customer service in the world. I am from Seattle and I come to Starbucks often. The baristas are always friendly and quick to point out the drinks. The only issue I have with this location is that it is very small. I am not sure if it is a good thing because I have been to other locations in the area"
Food,3.5,CG,"My husband and I come here a couple of times a week. There is a decent amount of space and the workers are always friendly. The drinks are always good, and the food is always good. The food is fresh and delicious. I always get the chicken wings with bimbo and chicken wings and it is always good. They also have a great variety of different food items. I love the fact that they have some cool specialty drinks and coffee drinks that are made locally."
Food,3.5,CG,"If you've been lucky enough to have the free wine tasting tour in your life, this is the place for you.  The tasting room is small but the tasting room is great for large groups.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view.  The only negative was that we were not a big wine drinker and it was a bit loud and loud.  We also got a tour of the winery and it was pretty good.  I'd definitely recommend this tour if you want to experience the wine."
Food,2.5,OR,"Hard to believe that the Safeway Store on Duval Mine Road can charge more than a store in Tucson.  Not only are Green Valley residents paying more for their gas, but now we find out that groceries are cheaper in Tucson.  A recent ad showed that the ads were the same, but the prices were higher in Green Valley than in Tucson for the same product.  I bet that Safeway wouldn't honor the Tucson price here in Green Valley.  Stop shopping at Safeway - go to Frys or Walmart - but stay away from Safeway unless you like being higher prices."
Food,5.0,OR,"Had an amazing time here. Our tour guide was awesome and knew what he was talking about. What a cool history and great distillery. You learned a lot about the company and its history. After the tour you get to taste a few different whiskeys/bourbons. I highly recommend coming here. They also have a small gift shop area with some fun stuff in it. This place has only been open about a year but I expect big things from them. The tour is worth the price $8 and they have them fairly frequently. The are very strict with IDs, so make sure your bring yours."
Food,1.5,OR,"Dunkin' is usually one of my fav places to get coffee, but this morning was so disappointing! My husband had Dunkin' at the Lindbergh location for the first time in the past month and loved it. He was so excited to go back this morning but now says he'll never go back to Dunkin' again. His coffee tasted like it had spoiled milk in it. He ordered the same thing-a medium hot coffee with French vanilla and cream. It was disgusting. I ordered an iced coffee with almond milk, and it tasted like it was 99% almond milk. Very disappointing experience at this location today!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Yup, if you've ever been to a publix you'll know your way around here. But this one is deserving if higher stars because it is clean, organized, nice workers, and most importantly convenient. It's right off a major road, and right next to a university. It has a slightly small selection than some other publix that I have been too, but it's still always got what I need. Well most of the time. Haha. But it's prices are great, especially with all there buy 1 get 1. :). That'll keep me coming back, especially when it's on chips and stuff that college kids live on."
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is SO GOOD! Some of best ice cream I've ever had. Amazing texture, rich and creamy, like velvet. My wife and I went to Crown's Candy Kitchen the night before, based on a feature from the Travel Channel and were very disappointed. Ted Drewes on the other hand, completely blew away our expectations. This is the place that should have been featured on the Travel Channel.

Don't mess around, get the Concrete. It comes in a variety of delicious flavors and mixes. We sat there for an hour and just tried one after another. Do your taste buds a favor and do the same."
Food,4.5,OR,"This is a really cool place. The other reviewers have nailed the food/wine/setting/vibe down so definitely read all those, but also know that Bacchanal is totally unpredictable. I came here on a few weekday nights in the winter months of 2012 and 2013 and had completely different experiences each time. Sometimes it's really crowded, sometimes it's almost empty. Sometimes everyone is a hipster, sometimes you'll find hipsters, non-hipsters, me, middle aged couples, and sorority girls. Sometimes there's live music. Sometimes there's no silverware. 

Aside from these discrepancies, Bacchanal is always funky and worth the trek to the Bywater if you don't already live around there."
Food,4.0,OR,"Wingfest is a great family event. We come every year from Santa Cruz to attend! Our favorite wings our the ""Secret Weapon"" from the Wing Master  booth. Our  second favorite choice is the Wing Doctors Sweet Teriyaki. The live music this year has been great. It is really crowded on Saturday, Friday evenings around 6 is a good time to attend. It's cooler and not as crowded. Keep that in mind for next year. 
We are looking forward to attending the Awards Ceremony on Saturday at 5:00.  Go WingMasters!  Please text WINGMAST to 22333 and vote by 4:00 SAT July 6th."
Food,4.5,OR,"Pretty regular customer. However today I ordered a vegan shake with Almond milk instead of regular milk. Two different employees recommended I went almond milk to stay vegan, however, neither mentioned a $4.75 up-charge. When checking out a third employee read my total, and as I questioned it, they told me there is an almond shortage in California, hence the up-charge. Almond Breeze brand milk is only $2.99 for a half gallon. $4.75 for a splash in a shake is a crime. The situation was remedied with a few coupons. This won't stop me from going back, but I don't think that is very reasonable"
Food,4.0,CG,"After reading some of the reviews, I thought it was a bit odd that there was a one time thing that I had to say, ""I don't like shopping in a grocery store"" or something. It was a little odd that there are only two things that you would have to pay a lot more for, and most of the employees are very nice. However, the prices are very reasonable, and I like the fact that they have some of the most unique items that you can get in your store."
Food,4.5,CG,"Great customer service and tasty treats. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the customer service. I had an employee walk me through the drive thru, and the first employee walked me through the menu and told me to go in the drive thru. This was ridiculous. I had to wait for a woman to come to the window, which was weird because it was a Friday afternoon. I didn't get my coffee and I was there for two hours. I waited about 30 minutes for my coffee to come out, and the girl"

Food,4.5,CG,"This has been on my list of places to try in Nashville. The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. The only thing I wish they would change is the hours. I would love to see more hours. I have to come back and try the breakfast sandwiches and coffee. Also, I love the coffee and the fact that they have a rewards program that allows you to earn points for your purchases."
Food,4.5,CG,I guess it's just my opinion. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the store is a little small. The store itself is small but the employees are nice. I go here to grab a couple things and the cashiers are always super friendly and helpful.The tour was great and the tour guide was really informative and fun.  The tour was very informative and interesting.  I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area!I am so happy that I discovered this place.  I had the pleasure of going
Food,4.5,CG,This place is my dream.  The coffee is amazing.  The owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is great.  I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I was looking for a quick stop for a coffee and a pastry on my way to work.

I went to customer service to tell them that they didn't have a special order for the special order.  I asked for the manager"
Food,3.0,OR,"Talk about cheap. Did my big grocery shopping on Eagles game day because Acme gives a 5% discount if you are wearing Eagles gear.  So I had my Eagles cap on expecting the discount.  Cashier said ""no can do"" because this year it must be a shirt of some kind...no hats!  Just gave me one more reason to hate this store.

Heard back from some manager who passed the buck and told me to go to Acme website. I did and emailed the contact. They answered; said they had no idea about the promotion, could I direct them to the information. People in suits."
Food,3.5,OR,"Ordered and it was fine... I can not believe the rude attitude of the gal that is working here right now.  I asked which drink was which if they were labeled and she said no and walked into the back for a while.  She came back out and I again asked is there a way to tell the drinks apart she didn't look at me and said ""the one on the right when I set them down"" what does that even mean!?!? So I exclaimed sorry for inconveniencing you... and she said NOTHING... mind blown! And I still don't know which coffee is mine"
Food,3.5,OR,"It's a STARBUCKS. I'm pretty sure everyone who reads these reviews already knows what to expect... but I'll write one anyways! :)

I always find this location to be extremely convenient and busy - right in the heart of touristy South Street. (If you do come here - make sure you walk one block up to see the Magic Gardens!) 

The coffee's hot, the sweets are scrumptious, and the baristas have always been super friendly in my experiences. I like to bring my own coffee mug for refills, too -- you usually wind up with a much larger cuppa'joe than ordering a disposable tall, grande, or vente."
Food,3.5,OR,"When I moved here years ago, I had never been to a Meijer because they don't exist in TX.  The first time I went there, I knew I was never going back to a Walmart!  I still shop at this Meijer 10 years after moving here, and will continue.  This store is clean and organized, and the customer base is also on another level than the Walmart crowd.  The staff is always helpful and they have comprehension skills also (unlike the experiences at Wally world).  
Sign up for the Mperks and the savings continue.  Keep up the great work Meijer!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"What can I say that hasn't been said before? (Maybe, add warm yellow lights instead of that pore enlarging white fluorescent? )  They have award winning beers and my beer snob of a boyfriend is addicted to them. I love the flights, relishing and teaching my novice tongue various flavors and jargon.  Still haven't taken the brewery tour yet since we can't seem to get up from our chairs once the tasty beers are in front of our faces.  Maybe, next time! This place is the best thing about Tampa really, besides the Lightning. Highly recommend whether you're a beer lover or not."
Food,4.5,OR,This is a great ice cream place with all your standard flavors and a few standouts. The location for us is what got us in. Being right outside the dog park. I got a medium chocolate peanut butter in a cone and it was decent. It's not my first choice for ice cream but I would definitely come back. Staff was very pleasant and the outside area is very nice. My only gripe is the standard flavors. I want a place that has some out there flavors something different something that stands out and makes me remember it. Definitely a solid option for ice cream though!
Food,2.5,OR,The cashier was not helpful in any way.  I needed help with putting air in my tires and he said the machine isn't working you gotta pay.  Said I'll pay whoever if they can help me.  I can't bend forward due to a hip replacement surgery.  He said no I can't help you. I am from out of town and was driving another 200 miles before getting to my destination.  I'm a handicapped female at night who needed helped and I was refused help.  I will not use a 76 gas station from now on due to this terrible incident.
Food,4.0,OR,"Fairly large sized Trader Joe's for the location that its in. It's almost always busy, though the line goes fast!

Coming from the suburbs and going into a city TJs, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get everything I wanted. But this location has a good selection of fruits/veggies and all of your favorite TJ stock ups so i didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. I came multiple times during the fall season and there is definitely no shortage of pumpkin flavored everythings (yum!)

If you go for a bigger haul there is also a decently sized parking lot in the back!"
Food,3.5,OR,"Such a great store! The store is brand new and beautiful, the ceiling has this recessed thing that helps keep the sound down, and the giant windows let in a ton of natural light. There's not a lot of seating room, but I think most of the crowd are business people grabbing a cup and moving on. I never have trouble finding space. The best part is the staff, who really make you feel welcome. After like my third time, the barista remembered my name! I've never been a regular before, it's so nice when the barista starts remembering you and suggesting new things you'll like."
Food,4.5,CG,"If you frequent the Ballpark mall, you might just notice it as a walk in market. The other two locations are in the same strip mall, but you'll be disappointed in the parking lot.

The store is a bit small, but it's worth it. The staff is always friendly and the store is clean. I love the fact that they have a punch card machine. I just wish there was more seating. But if you're looking for a good selection of beverages, it's a great place to hang out."
Food,3.0,CG,"Yes, the product quality has improved. The quality has gone down a lot since the last time I was here. The prices are reasonable, and the staff is very friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get to the store. There are many people who shop here, but the people working there are generally friendly and helpful. I can't wait to come back here!I will say I went there with my sister for the first time today. We had a very positive experience. The staff were very helpful and the menu"
Food,4.5,CG,Amazing beer.  I was here on a weekend night and I saw a lot of people drinking and drinking.  I had the Chicken wings and the Cheddar Tuna.  I was so happy to see this place open up in the same part of town.  I ordered the Chicken wings and a 2 tier burger.  I also got the chicken wings and it was so good.  I was so happy with the beer.  The fries were huge and flavorful.  I will definitely be back to try their other beers.
Food,2.5,CG,"This is by far the best ice cream shop in Reno.  The owners are very friendly and the atmosphere is great.  I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here everyday.I was looking for a quick stop for a coffee and a pastry while visiting a friend. I walked in and was surprised to see that there was a small area with all the usual goodies. The decor was very modern, modern, and modern."
Food,3.5,CG,"I ordered a Bold Coffee, a vanilla latte, and a cold brew. The barista said they were out of the coffee but I thought they would have a ""good"" cold brew that I could order in the morning. I was told it would be ready in a few minutes. I had a drip coffee with a shot of espresso. I ordered a latte with a shot of espresso. The barista was nice and nice, but it took a while for her to make my drink."
Food,4.0,CG,"The things I love about this place is the food. I always get my cheese and fruit and they have so many different types of cheese.  The salad bar is so yummy and so yummy.  It's a little pricey but it's worth it.  If you have a party, they have a lot of fun things to do.  If you like cheese and fruits, I highly recommend getting the cheese and fruits from the bakery.  They have a very good selection of cheeses and other baked goods as well."
Food,4.0,CG,"We came here for a weekend treat and the ice cream was fantastic. The staff was friendly and we had a great time. I will definitely be back!I love this place. The cakes are so beautiful and the flavors are so fresh. I wish I could get some from here! I love the name and the taste! I also love the fact that they are open until 10am. I just wish there was more seating. But if you want to try a cupcake, go to the bakery next door."
Food,2.0,CG,"I'm only reviewing the pharmacy. I've been here twice and they have the worst customer service. If you're looking to get a prescription filled, you should go to Walgreens. It's a shame because they can't fill it for you. Great location with great service. I ordered a large iced coffee with oat milk and it was delicious. The employees were friendly and helpful. I'd definitely come back here again if I were in the area."
Food,4.5,CG,"The best bagels in the city. The only reason I don't give this place a 4 star is because the employees are so rude, and they're the only ones working the drive thru. If you want to be in a hurry, they can't be bothered to give you your order. I don't know how long the line will be, but the line goes out the door. They make my drinks right and I love the atmosphere and the customer service. It's very sad that they are close to my house, but I"
Food,4.0,OR,"I live in Brandon which is probably 45 minutes from St Pete brewing company , but it is so worth the drive! 
They have great beer selection and different flight options. They even have a flight option with 15 beers on it. Which is my go to because I can never pick one beer. 
They also have a popcorn machine which comes in handy when you get hungry. 
While you're there you can also play some Mario Kart which is my boyfriend and I's favorite part! We go for the flights and popcorn and Mario Kart.  
I will always be a huge fan of this brewery"
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is so cute. I didn't know they had this location because I've only been to the one in ybor but I like this one, less crowded but terrible parking. The staff was friendly and the ice cream was good. I got the bees knees ice cream it's the only one I've had from them but it's good. The only reason I can't give it five stars is because the ice cream isn't as creamy as I like but that's just a personal preference. If you're in the area and looking for a good place to try some unique ice cream this is the perfect spot!"
Food,2.5,OR,"Always been a fan of Coldstone. I hadn't patronized it in about 3 years. Everything about the way they create the ice cream creations is properly assembled. The business model has been copied. But, I stay true to Coldstone. For me, I have an extremely difficult time finding simply MINT ice cream. I love MCC (Mint Choclate Chip). But many times if available, I'd much rather have only Mint. Coldstone is one of the few major ice cream franchises that carries it. I use Mint as the base for the rest of the Love It level. Today I had mint/Cherry Vanilla w/Snickers chunks. I destroyed it quickly."
Food,4.0,OR,"What a cute little cheese shop!

While I was getting my nails done, my husband spent a good portion of his morning in the cheese shop sipping coffee and playing on his lap top.  I stopped in for a quick snack after my nail appointment and sampled the chicken salad and the orzo salad - both were extremely good.  This spot also offers sandwiches, soups, and a huge variety of meats and cheeses.  This is an ideal spot for lunch or to just stock up for a charcuterie.  The staff was very nice and my husband ended up having a very nice morning here."
Food,3.0,OR,"This Publix location has some customer service training needs. I had the worst customer service interaction I've ever had here. I grew up in Florida so Publix has always been ""my grocery store"". The reason people pay a little more to shop here is because of the customer service in my opinion. Unfortunately, this location could change my mind. After having several items ring up incorrectly. Then re-rung incorrectly. Calling, coming back for the correction and being spoken to incredibly rudely, I was ultimately given a gift card for their mistake rather than the refund I requested. Sad to see such a great corporation dropping the ball."
Food,4.0,OR,"The strength here I'm guessing is the coffee. I went to try the wine. I wouldn't call it industrial, but I had a hard time finding one out of the 16 or so they offered I wanted to try, so I got a wheat beer instead. I liked the beer.
They have some food they offer from their cooler, including pre-made food. I got a turkey and feta croissant that they heated in the microwave. It tasted like a leftover croissant reheated in the microwave.
Service was friendly. 
The way it's laid out, there's like a coffee area in one room and a lounge area in the next room."
Food,4.5,OR,This review is specifically for the downtown location. First time here... pretty cool! Small but awesome location! I sort of find it weird that they serve other ciderys products but hey whatever! I got their mulled cider and it was super good! I've always been a fan of Meriwether so I'm not surprised in the quality of their product! I would say if you have never been to Meriwether go to this location. It's in a way more of a hip spot and might give you a better experience. But I also love the other location as well! I don't think you will go wrong with either.
Food,4.5,OR,"Not sure what was going on.  When they opened, none of the cupcakes were set out.   Most were frozen in the ice cream case.   I thought the cupcakes were fresh, not frozen.  Chairs not set up and the place looked in total disarray.   New ownership maybe?   New manager?  Whatever the reason was, I was very disappointed.  The cupcake I got (one of the few unfrozen ones) was pretty flavorless.  The one I really wanted was a key lime but they were some of the frozen ones.   Hard to eat a rock-hard cupcake."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great high quality stuff. Cookies and chocolates are amazing. Reason for 4 stars is the service I got. The store was a little loud so there was a bit of a communication issue with the cashier I got. She was very annoyed that She couldn't hear me over the thick safety glass around the pastry items. It ended with her saying  ""what?!"" with an accompanied eye roll and eye brow scowl. I finally  had to say to her ""ok, I can't hear you either"" she wasn't very friendly. But I guess everyone has bad days. The chocolates were not only delicious they are so pretty."
Food,4.0,CG,"Where to begin? The quality of the ice cream is just what it is, and the customer service is top notch. The staff is always friendly and the shop is clean. The only downside is that it is in a very small strip mall. I come here to get gas for the week. I have to stop here every day. The gas is always so cheap. I always get the same thing every week. The customer service is always good and the gas is always very fresh."
Food,4.0,CG,"I really enjoy the French Truck Coffee and the food trucks.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food is good but the service is terrible. I go to this location everyday and the line is long. The drive thru is very backed up. The staff is always extremely rude and very unhelpful. I had to wait 30 minutes for my order. I have never had a bad experience here. I'm sure they do have a good selection of baked goods though. I would recommend going to the one in"
Food,4.0,CG,"They change their flavors daily, and it's always a fun experience. 

The staff is always so friendly and the ice cream is delicious. The staff is always so nice and friendly. 

You can get a large scoop of ice cream if you want to share. You can always get 2 flavors: vanilla and chocolate, or the double chocolate with chocolate chips. I love that they offer different flavors of ice cream as well as special creations. 

The only thing that I have to say about this place is that"
Food,5.0,CG,"Tried going up here on a weekday and the line was out the door! The guy working the front was so nice and the place was clean and inviting! I got the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was delicious! I will definitely be coming back and trying some of their other treats!I'm not a huge fan of Krispy Kreme's donuts but this place is a good place for a quick bite or a quick snack.  I like that they have a bit of everything to offer from doughnuts, sandwiches,"
Food,3.0,CG,"I always enjoyed this store, especially the bakery, and I will continue to go there. 

The employees are always helpful, and they're always very friendly. They have a nice selection of cakes and cakes. 

I can't wait to come back.Great location, great service. 

I go here almost every weekend and it is a great place to go for a great treat! 

We love the location and the prices are very reasonable. 

They also have a coffee machine. "
Food,3.0,CG,"This review is solely based on the service. 

We were in the neighborhood and decided to go to Bier Brewery. The bartender and server were extremely friendly and accommodating. The bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful in explaining the different beers. We ordered a flight of four and each one had a very unique taste. I sampled four different beers and the one I had was definitely the best I've ever had! I highly recommend this place.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite is the strawberry cake,"
Food,4.0,CG,Super cute place that we saw on the menu. We ordered a cappuccino and a waffle cone. The staff was very friendly and the ice cream was great. I'm so excited to see this place open in the neighborhood. I love the decor and the vibe. I love the vintage chairs and the old school decor. I love the decor and the staff is always super friendly and accommodating. I am so excited to see this new addition to the neighborhood!Amazing coffee.
Food,4.5,OR,"I've tried of a few of the beers here and nothing lights my world on fire, but they have a wide variety available. There's never been food when I've gone, but I admittedly haven't come during peak times. It gets insanely loud in here, so if you're looking to have a conversation, sit outside. There are a couple separated rooms so it's not super small, but the layout makes it seem really crowded. Lots of board games if that's your jam. I've always had really pleasant and quick service, even when they are busy. There's lots of parking, which is a plus because it's in a residential neighborhood."
Food,4.5,OR,"This is a very cool space with creative bartenders. I was surprised it was not more crowded when we were there, but it was raining, so I suppose a lot of people stayed home due to that. We were visiting from out of town so were looking for interesting places to visit. The few block area that surrounds this bar is full of cool places. If I lived in Reno, I'd want to be within walking distance of this place.

It's a craft cocktail bar and they do a nice job of including some creative options. The walls, floor - everything - is black, so it's quite dark inside."
Food,5.0,OR,"What a fun night we had! Organizing was easy! Darin and Sierra are professional and friendly.  Our families were treated to an amazing driver in Danny, who was fun, sweet, friendly. Helped get our little one to a restroom when need.  We felt we had a friend on board. He knows where to go and did so safely. The bus was so festive and so much more comfortable than a trolley. We had the best time. Our 4 families agree...It was a great way to kick off the holidays. We will be using this company again!  Thanks Jump on the School Bus and Happy Holidays!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Either my taste buds have changed or the Blue Cow has changed its supplier. Their flavors have more flavor - the peanut butter was very; the coconut just dropped out of a tree and the coffee flavor was just brewed. The Blue Cow is back on their ""A"" game. During this time of virus concerns, the first thing you find is a stack of plastic gloves. You wear one on the had you use to operate the dispensers. They will serve the condiments and they are masked and wear a glove. The spoons are also wrapped for your safety. And they are friendly. We are back as regulars."
Food,2.5,OR,"Chinese guy was in the electronics cashing about 2 people out. I kindly said excuse me and told him whenever he had a minute could I get one of the Xbox games out of the locked case. He laughed rudely and just looked towards what he was scanning. I walked back to the games waiting on him and after it had been about 5-8 minutes I went to go remind him. Figured he just forgot, and he wasn't there. Literally stood in the electronic center for 35 minutes and asked at least 4-5 employees to page someone who could unlock the case for me. Finally got the game."
Food,4.0,OR,"I love hanging out on the back patio of Elsie's. Both comfortable and happening at the same time make it a rare breed. Perhaps not having a full bar is part of what keeps the crowd mellow but I have to knock 1 star off anyway. I am a Saphire & Tonic man and it's hard for me to pay $8 for a glass of wine that tastes like a decent $10-15 bottle.

Oh, and CASH ONLY! I've had to make a few trips to the ATM in Paseo Nuevo mall. I wish they at least had one of those little ATMs that charge you up the ying yang."
Food,4.5,OR,"Stopped by to have a break on Main Street New Port Richey and happened upon Ottoways  Parkside Ice Cream Parlor. A neat place with indoor and outdoor seating. They have an exceptional choice of ice cream and even egg cream. There are cookies and hot dogs and boiled punts too. I had a very small scoop of low/no added sugar butter pecan ice cream, that was out of this world. My husband had a strawberry hot fudge sundae that had whipped cream and a cherry on top. The staff are courteous and helpful. When you visit down town you must check them out! We will be back."
Food,2.5,CG,"This location is convenient due to the free parking lot. I will admit that I have been a frequent customer of this location for years, but since then, I have had a very poor experience with the staff. It was very unprofessional and unprofessional. This is my first time at this location. I will continue to drive past this location and be more often.I've been coming here for a few years now and it's pretty good.  I like that they have a great selection of items that you can't find anywhere else. "
Food,4.0,CG,"I came here as a last minute gift for my wife's birthday. The cake was pretty good. The woman at the counter was very friendly and offered to make a cake for her. I told her that I wanted a cake for my mom and she said ""no problem"" and gave me a sheet of the cake. I think the cake was great. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a special occasion cake. I would definitely recommend this bakery to anyone looking for a special occasion cake."
Food,4.0,CG,"First time ever trying them, it was the best. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in at around 3:15pm and they had a sign on the door saying that it was closed. It was not.  The store was dirty and the employees were very rude.  They were rude to the customers and also the manager.  They are very rude and unprofessional.  I will never shop here again.Great experience, friendly staff, good selection of wine, and a friendly staff. You can tell they care about"
Food,4.5,CG,I walked in for the first time and the girl behind the counter was super sweet! I ordered the Strawberry shortcake and it was delicious. The strawberry shortcake was so moist and delicious. I also had the strawberry shortcake which was very moist. My boyfriend got the strawberry shortcake and it was very good! I will definitely be back and I hope to try some of their other flavors!This place is amazing! I was there for the first time and loved the atmosphere and the service! I had the matcha latte and the match
Food,4.5,CG,"The Botanical Garden was one of the top places we visited for our first time. I was not expecting a lot of the crowds but the crowds and the crowds were not bad. I would definitely go again. 

The staff was extremely friendly. I appreciated how they offered samples of the various wines before making a decision. I also appreciated the fact that they offered tastings of all kinds of wines. This was a fun experience and we will definitely be back.This is a great place for a relaxing day or just for a relaxing,"
Food,4.5,CG,"Love this place for a weekend treat.  We decided to try a few different flavors and the staff was so friendly.  I got a vanilla and the flavor was so good.  We will definitely be back.  The flavor was very subtle.This was our first time coming here and we loved it. They have the most beautiful desserts and the staff was very friendly. I got the coconut cream pie and it was delicious. We will definitely be coming back.This is a great place for a quick bite to eat, or for a quick"
Food,4.0,CG,"I am so so impressed with the whole space and the people who work there. I am not a coffee drinker but I am a coffee drinker and I think this place is pretty cool. They have a great selection of pastries and coffee. I love their coffee and they have a great selection of pastries. I will definitely be back!Delicious coffee and pastries. They make my coffee with care and love. I love their breakfast sandwich with a side of coffee beans. 

The only downside is they have limited hours"
Food,4.0,OR,"Located next to Pappy's, this is a cool spot to take your BBQ to go and get a cold beer to wash it down! This is a hockey themed (Blues) bar, which was a cool vibe. There are lots of subtle hockey decor features to wander around and check out. The most unique of which is the hockey rink boards around the actual brewing area. The space is bright and open. We were there when it wasn't busy so there was plenty of seating. The bartender was very friendly and helpful. We liked the beers we had! They have some board games to entertain a group or a couple."
Food,3.0,OR,"""Liliana"" and ""Coach Joy"" at this location were the worst. Not only did they lack professionalism but their customer service skills were atrocious. I don't know what made them think it was appropriate to make rude comments about me while I was trying to make a return with my son. I also stress the word ""trying"" to make a return because apparently Sam's Club lacks the return policy value of ""keeping customers happy"" that Costco is so great about doing. 

While I feel there are definitely good deals to be had at Sam's Club I would much rather spend my money elsewhere to employee better and more courteous individuals."
Food,5.0,OR,"It started with a Groupon. We tried different types of beans and found we loved the Guatemala Antigua. We get three pounds at a time. When we are running low, my wife waves the nearly empty bag and reminds me that I will get no more lovin unless I get more Wood Fire Roasted Coffee...So yeah, I think that makes us regular and satisfied customers...


1/2013:
As a followup to the past review: We still buy about three pounds per month. I call, tell Tim I am running low, and he makes time to run my coffee through. 

The combination of excellent coffee and terrific customer service are tough to beat."
Food,4.5,OR,"This has to be one of the best bottle shops in the Philadelphia area! I was told by one of my in laws about the spot, so my girlfriend and I decided to check it out. As soon as you walk in, you see shelves upon shelves of different beers! You can get anything from local craft, big macros, or even beer from across the globe! The staff here was very friendly and willing to help direct us around the maze of beer, since it was our first time. The prices are pretty decent here, unlike most downtown bottle shops. This is definitely the best place to get beer!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I LOVE the beer yard! They have the broadest selection of case beers than any other store on the main line. Trying to find that rare beer from Munich? No problem! That new beer that is made in limited quantities? They got it! The staff know what they are talking about too. You can ask them about a beer and will give you full detail about the selection and five others you might like. They are really nice guys too.

The only ""downside"" is that they only sell cases. so exploration is a bit expensive. But once you find what you're looking for they have the best deals in town."
Food,4.5,OR,"I would lean slightly closer to three stars for the simple fact that none of their beers are flawed but at the same time, there's nothing interesting here either.  The best beer was the Serrano Seduction but it doesn't really stand out from the many variations off this theme out there.  Darker beers seem muddled and unbalanced.  IPAs lack a focused hop presence.  I think this place would fall off the map if they weren't kept alive by the constant Groupon discounts drawing people in for at least one visit.  Are people really returning without the Groupon?  Too many other choices for me."
Food,3.5,OR,"Well this is a fancy Safeway! 

It felt like a little bit of adventure- the store seems to be designed in a circular manner, and with every turn there's a new surprise. 

They have a really nice produce department, a decent section of ""ready to go"" meals, and the meat looked fresh and fairly priced. I was able to quickly lock down my sesame sauce (greatest condiment on the planet, FYI) and some chicken broth without the usual 20 minutes of annoyed wandering through aisles of an unfamiliar store, so that was rad.

Employees seem friendly enough, and I didn't have to wait forever to check out.

Win! I'll be back."
Food,3.5,CG,"I'm not quite sure why this place is so famous. I visited on a Sunday morning and the place was packed. The place is small and small, but there are a lot of nice tables and chairs in the back. I ordered a cinnamon roll and a chai tea. I was amazed at how they make the drinks and it was a little overwhelming. I was expecting more coffee and it was pretty strong. I expected a good amount of cinnamon and it was very light and smooth."
Food,5.0,CG,"Our guide Pat was excellent. We learned so much about the history of the place, the history of the building and the history of the distillery. The tour was informative and great. The tasting room was well kept and clean. We will be back.This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a place to go and I had to try it. I've heard great things about this place, but I'm not sure if they have some type of wine or beer. We got to try the wine flight, which included a flight"
Food,3.5,CG,"This is a GREAT Target, and it's the only one I will go to for the stuff that I need. The parking lot is a mess and the carts are always empty. I go to this Target everyday and it's always a nightmare. There are always people who are waiting in the carts and a woman who's behind the counter who's had to wait on them for her turn. They have always been very nice and helpful. I'm sure they do have a good selection of things, but I've never seen a lot of items I've"
Food,3.0,CG,"The pharmacy. This pharmacy is not an easy task to make.

The staff is friendly and the store is clean. The store is well kept and the shelves are stocked. I go to this location often and the store is always stocked. There are always people who are waiting in line. 

The only downside to this location is the fact that it is a little pricier than other locations. This location has a lot of items on sale. I always feel like I'm getting something for the dollar. The store is usually very well"
Food,5.0,CG,"I had Amy's boozy bites and it was the best part of our meal! The variety of flavors was so so unique and delicious. The ice cream is the best part of the meal! We will be back!This place is a dump. There are only two registers open. The lines are always long. And they close at 9am. 

They are a little overpriced. I just went there to pick up a few things. The cashier was super rude and rude.

Food,4.5,CG,We were able to have a beer and wine tasting in the tasting room for a couple hours and we sat down at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The wine was great. The staff was very friendly and I would highly recommend them. This is a great place for a great tasting.A nice place to go and hang out with a friend or a friend. They have a lot of different beers and some wines. They have a great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly.I had a hard time deciding on a flavor I wanted

Food,4.5,CG,"YAY!!  A real beer store.  

I will admit that I am a regular.   I had a friend from out of town that we met at a local brewery that we were visiting in the area.   The shop is tucked away in a industrial complex that is tucked away behind the bar.   I was very impressed with the brewery.  It is a nice place to sit and enjoy some beer.

I think this place is pretty cool. They have a great selection of items, from greeting cards, and friendly staff. The staff is always helpful. And they have the most convenient parking. There's a Starbucks inside as well. They have a great selection of snacks and beverages. They also have some cool specialty drinks and coffee. They have a lot of fresh produce, meats"
Food,3.0,CG,Horrible service. I called to complain to the manager and they said they were out of the order and we had to wait a few minutes for them to get the order. I was very confused that they were out of the order. I was told it would be ready in a few minutes. I had a call to let them know and they said they would call me by the next day. They didn't seem to care. I was told by the manager that it would be ready by the time we got there. I'm not sure if I
Food,2.5,OR,Just called to get my husbands prescription started so he could call and pick it up. Pharmacy tech Riley answered and acted as if she was completely put out by me calling  .With a heavy annoyed sigh  abruptly asked for his date of birth confirmed his first name ONLY and said yep we'll get it going for him and hung up before i could even say thank you have a nice day. She needs a serious attitude adjustment or shouldn't be working with the public. People need thier meds and there is no reason to be rude. If you hate your job  go get a different one.
Food,4.0,OR,"I periodically make a stop here every now and then, if I happen to be in this side of town. Just like most oriental market, they have approximately the same pan-Asian food products, household items, Bath and beauty products, etc.  I like the ready made Korean snacks and kimchi they have available near the produce section. They even have these cute little crabs that you can eat whole. They are covered in some kind of read Korean style sauce and the shells are edible.

Customer service was pretty typical as there is usually one person who works behind the counter and minds the store. overall a pretty decent shopping experience."
Food,3.5,OR,"I've never reviewed a psychic before, and I'm not sure how to judge whether it was good or bad.  But I will say I had a very pleasant experience at Bottom of the Cup Tearoom.

First off, there was a bit of a wait.  But I love tea, so waiting in a tea room is not half bad.
Second, my reading was great.  The tarot card reader was really nice, nailed a few facts about me and my life, and gave me some great advice :)

After my reading I got a CD of the session, so I can refer back to see any of his predictions comes to fruition!"
Food,3.5,OR,"I know Maggie Moo's is a chain, but having never had it before I moved to Nashville, this review if for those 'not from around these parts' people. I cant think of anything better than someone letting me pick my ice cream and then letting me shove it full of any and every topping I can think of, and believe me I do just that. My favorite Maggie Moo's ice cream flavors are better batter or cheesecake; mix in caramel, brownies, and cookie dough and you have heaven in a cup. Seriously, delicious and if you don't like it, it's your own fault because you pretty much made it yourself!"
Food,4.0,OR,"During the Fringe, I spent a fair amount of time in this Second Cup drinking frozen strawberry lemonades and working on my laptop, taking advantage of the free wireless internet. The air conditioning and a little area at the back with a few tables and padded seating made it possible to escape the heat, sort of escape the massive crowds and concentrate on getting my work done. It's definitely not my favourite Second Cup just because the layout offers little privacy - every seat is either in a high-traffic spot or cuddled up next to a floor-to-ceiling window - but this summer, I certainly was grateful that it was around."
Food,2.5,OR,I like this location they are friendly and They are usually cool at this location. Lately every time I ask for the dark roast coffee they lie straight to my face and say they don't have it. I let it slide the past few times. Today I called them out on their not so good poker face and told them stop lying to me about not having the dark roast blend (hot coffee) as soon as I did that all of a sudden they had it available. They just don't want to brew it for some reason. What's up with that? I read people very well you can't bs me!
Food,3.5,OR,"This place is very new! When you walk in you are required to fill out a menu of what milkshake you would like. They have many options and also kid size ! The adult size is actually good for one person at 12$ ! A little much but it's fine for a fun treat once in a while! I got the smore campfire milkshake! Very yummy ! My niece got the cookie dough and I even liked that one better! The ice cream is very good!!!   There is parking right beside the place and escape room right across street!! 

I would for sure come back for a treat!"
Food,3.0,OR,The cupcakes and other baked goods all looked amazing. I am pregnant so I was craving chocolate after lunch so we decided to stop in. I got a traditional vanilla cupcake with chocolate icing. The icing wasn't too sweet which I liked but tasted very oily and crisco like. The cake part was good but not great and there wasn't a lot of it since the cupcake was not only topped but also filled with icing. I probably wouldn't go back. I would give one star for the cupcake but I had to give 2 stars in total since the service was great and the lady working was super friendly!
Food,3.0,OR,"Oof! Writing another review because the prices can't be beat here, but had a little mishap with the Luna Bars. I'm not sure if it was because of the flavor (lemon), but when I bit into it there were little boll weevils in it! Thankfully it was the only one that had it..

A word of wise: They have these bargain boxes that are full of chips two for $5. A steal right? Sort of. More than half will be rancid, but you still do save money considering most bags were $3 each. In the end it's not worth going through every bag and sniffing radioactive waste, so don't buy these."
Food,3.5,OR,"First Starbucks that didn't write Jade when I told them my name! I mean... they still spelled my name wrong, but at least it was some form of my name. They got my order right, and were very quick about it. I noticed they get a lot of mobile orders, and they are very good about dealing with those while simultaneously handling the orders in store. I got my coffee very quickly. There is plenty of seating, and the bathroom is clean. If you are looking for outlets, there are a few good spots to plug in. This particularly location is basically what I would expect from any Starbucks store."
Food,3.5,CG,"I came here last night and it was the best experience I've had! The guy working the counter was so friendly and the place was clean and inviting! I got the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was amazing! I will definitely be coming back and trying some of their other treats!I'm not a huge fan of Krispy Kreme's donuts but this place is a good place for a quick bite or a quick snack.  I like that they have a bit of everything to offer from doughnuts, sandwiches, pastries, and"
Food,2.0,CG,"Never had an issue with this store, the cashiers are always friendly and helpful. I just wish that they had a 24 hour grocery store. The only downside is the parking lot is a bit of a nightmare. It's a bit of a challenge to park on the street and have to pay a lot of money to get in and out of the lot. Otherwise, this store is a nice place to shop if you want to go to a specific location.Love this place!  The coffee is amazing, the service is great, and the atmosphere is"
Food,4.5,CG,"I love this swanky little ice cream shop. It's a little on the pricey side but the quality is so worth it. I got a small scoop of the ""S'more"" which is vanilla ice cream with chunks of Oreo on top. My boyfriend got the ""Munchkin"" which is a chocolate milkshake with a scoop of the ""FroYo"" which is a seasonal flavor. The flavors were really good and they have some cool unique flavors. I'm not sure if I would go back but I'm sure I'll"
Food,5.0,CG,"First stop on our quickie weekend. The menu is HUGE and the people who work there are always so nice. Great drinks and great service. I think the place is pretty small, but it's not really a large space. There are a couple of tables and chairs for people to sit. I have never seen it open, but I do think it's a great place to hang out. This is definitely a must if you're in the area. This is a great place for a quick bite on a hot summer day."
Food,2.5,CG,"I ordered a drink through the app and the girl in front of me was just standing there and staring at me.  The guy behind me took my order and didn't even say thank you.  I told her I wanted a drink and she told me I had to order something else.  I said ""ok I guess I want a drink"".  She said ""oh I'm here for my drink, I'm here for my drink.

Food,4.0,CG,"I don't often crave bagels, but this was the best. I got a bagel with a side of a bagel. The bagel was also crispy, and the cream cheese was pretty good. The bagel was moist, and the cream cheese was sweet and creamy. I would definitely return if I'm in the area!They are always busy, but they are always so friendly. They make my drinks right! I love the atmosphere and the music they have at the end of the night!I've been here a few times. "
Food,4.0,CG,"Bern's Fine Wines & Spirits.  The only reason I don't give this place a 4 star is because it's the closest store to my house, but if you're a local, this place is a great place to go.  If you are going to get some alcohol in the store, it's best to go to the one in the South Reno area.  If you're looking for liquor in the Reno area, I'd recommend you go here!Love this place!

I will continue to shop at this location because I think the store is much cleaner and has more organic products.This place is great. I came here after dinner for dessert and it was amazing. It's not a bad place, but definitely"
Food,4.5,OR,"Dropped by here with a few friends in the afternoon to try out the popsicles and was quickly welcomed by the clean, aesthetically-appealing, and personable interior as well as enthusiastic staff. 

I tried a mint basil popsicle, and the flavor was a bit too strong for me, but the lychee coconut was INCREDIBLE! I highly recommend trying this flavor--it has the perfect amount of lightness + sweetness, and tasted so refreshing on a warm day!

Although I feel the pricing is high per popsicle, it is worth a shot to stop in and explore what's on their menu, especially since they offer so many unique popsicle flavors and other sweets to try!"
Food,4.0,OR,"We love the convenience of Metabolic Meals.  My husband and I work different shifts, and its difficult to find time to plan and cook a proper meal together.  Metabolic Meals has saved the day, with the wide variety of healthy and nutritious meals available each week.  Deliveries have been spot on and I love a meal service where we don't have to eat the same meal at the same time.  Portion size and nutritional value is also just right to meet our needs (tasty gluten free is awesome).  We have saved $$$ by not ordering out simply because we were too tired to think about cooking!"
Food,4.5,OR,"When I lived in New Orleans, this place was my guilty pleasure. I remember battling torrential downpours and the oppressive heat just for a scoop of their lavender honey. Now that I live out of town, I find myself craving their ice cream. Everything is fresh and made with care. The smell of homemade waffle cones greets you as you open the door and the staff are friendly and helpful. For chocolate lives, I highly recommend the chocolate amaretto cheesecake. To satisfy a sweet tooth, petit four will do the trick. On the lighter side, their seasonal sorbet is refreshingly satisfying. If you havent already figured, Im hooked on this place!"
Food,3.5,OR,"I used to go to this one a lot. Now I'm telling you this as a word of warning. They try to pass off unripe habaneros as the real thing. These are not the right produce. I specifically need orange ones for my business. They had bags of green ones, I asked when they were getting orange ones, I was told the green ones are orange. You have better luck digging through the ones at a grocery store. At least they're ripe and you won't get treated like you're an idiot. I'm going elsewhere because I know the difference between good produce, now I hope you do a little bit more."
Food,4.5,OR,"Went here for the very first time ever today and let me just say, I don't know what was better- the service or the food. The young lady working the drive through had the type of customer service you'd receive at a four seasons. She was the sweetest gal and she KNEW HER BUSINESS. We got a raspberry Italian soda, the pepper jack and sausage bfast sandwich and the Swiss/ Canadian bacon sandwich and it was probably the best bfast sammies we've ever had. This place should be as popular and accessible as Starbucks we need more of them everywhere. No one will be disappointed in giving this place a try."
Food,5.0,OR,"They offer around 10-12 types of bundt cakes of various sizes to take to go. We tried the lemon and the chocolate chocolate chip. Our cakes were a little larger than a good sized cupcake at $3.99. Both were tasty, moist, and had a good cake to frosting ratio. I think the frosting may be the same on each cake that they offer, which is kind of weird. Overall, i think these cakes are a good dessert option and a good addition to the area. The people working were pleasant and seemed to be enjoying their job. If you're looking for cookies too, then look elsewhere, this is nothing bundt cakes."
Food,4.0,OR,"This isn't your typical convenience store attached to a set of gas pumps (ethanol free gas at that).  Sure you can buy Bud and Miller if that is your choice, but they pride themselves on their selection of craft beers.  They have locally brewed beers as well as beers from other parts of the country on the shelf, in the cooler, and in the walk-in Beer Cave.  Their wine selection is predominently in the $10 - $20 range with a few over and under.  They claim to carry over 180+ different bottles of wine at all times.  It's a family owned store with a functional website."
Food,3.5,OR,"I've had cupcakes from here a few times, but this was my first time actually going to the bakery. There are a couple different locations. The worker was really friendly and helpful here. They have gluten free options which are stored separately from the rest of the cupcakes to avoid cross contamination. There were about 3 different gluten free flavors to choose from as well as a couple vegan options. The case displayed about a dozen different options for the ""regular"" cupcakes. I got a peanut butter bomb for my husband. The pina colada one looked really good, too! Overall good experience here with both the service and the cupcakes themselves!"
Food,5.0,OR,"I was greeted by the owner as soon as I walked in! What a nice gentlemen. 

It was my wife's birthday so I decided to stop in and buy here a cake for her surprise birthday! Who doesn't like birthday cake! He walked me thru the process of lots of options and pointed me to their delicious samples!

I got a 10"" cake for $43 (including decorations) no tax (since hey don't offer done in). The cakes are so rich and delicious! I got marble base. I will say.. adding decorations for $10/11 is a bit over priced but it's all about convenience I suppose.  

Overall, I'd def come again :)"
Food,4.0,CG,"The atmosphere was fantastic! I had a free sample of their wine and they also have a wine club. I'll be back!I am a huge fan of T&T. I go to it almost everyday and I am always in a hurry. I love their selection of alcohol and have found the prices to be very reasonable. I also love the fact that they have a punch card. They have a great selection of beer and wines. They also have some cool specialty drinks and coffee. They have a lot of fresh produce, meats, produce, etc."

Food,2.5,CG,This Walgreens is the absolute worst. The employees are rude and rude. There is a person who is a manager named Joe. I am upset that they have a customer service line and it's just a matter of personal preference. I will never shop here again.I've been coming here since I was a kid. I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best selection. It's right next to the train station. It's easy to get in and out of the parking lot. It's the perfect location for a nice
Food,2.5,CG,I love this location. I go here at least once a week. The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. I love this location because it is so close to home. I love this place. The staff is always friendly and the ice cream is delicious. I had the blueberry sorbet and it was delicious! My husband had the peach ice cream and he loved it. The prices are very reasonable. The only downside is that it's not open 24 hours.
Food,4.5,CG,My family and I were here on a weekend night. We saw a lot of people drinking and we saw a lot of people drinking beers. I think the place is pretty cool. They had a few TVs outside which was nice. I would come back to try some of the other beers. I ended up going with the Pilsner and it was a little sweet. They have a great menu with some beer flights if you want to try all of them. The staff is pretty friendly and the place is very clean.
Food,2.0,CG,"About 70% of the problem is the people working there. I saw a guy who was working the front desk and told him to leave, but he then walked out, so he was going to go somewhere else. It was a little awkward for him to leave and leave. He had no idea what to do and was just going to get a manager. I didn't think he was supposed to be there, but he seemed to be there for two hours. He was standing there for a while and his behavior was very defensive, so I walked out, and"
Food,4.5,CG,"WOW!!!!!  So many beers on tap and the food trucks are always around for a reason!  The food trucks are always open and the food trucks are always out of the same food trucks that go there everyday.  Definitely a great addition to the area!  If you're in the area and don't want to have to go to a brewery, this is the place to go.We love this place.  I love the atmosphere and the music.  It's very fun to watch the music playing.  You can see the brewing process,"
Food,4.5,OR,"This location is doing a fantastic job of navigating the current COVID crisis. Staff members are actively limiting how many customers are in the store, making sure the carts have an antibacterial wipe on them as they hand them off to customers, and have marks at the checkout lines to show where to stand for proper social distancing. This has made shopping there very stress-free in a time when going out in public is stressful for all of us. So thank you, Trader Joe's, for doing so much to make all of us as safe as possible - and also for letting us get all the frozen food and snacks we need."
Food,3.0,OR,"I don't live in Sherwood Park, nor do I frequent this Save On Foods location very often, but when I do, it's usually during my meal breaks, so i've always found this location to be quiet, with ample parking and I can find whatever I need without feeling frazzled by crowds or carts. Today, I was happily surprised to see free slices of fresh watermelon upon entering the store to promote that they were on sale - oh it was so good! And perfect for the hot day it was! (I actually went back for two slices.... shhhhh!) I would recommend this location as i'm sure it'll serve all your grocery needs!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Cute decor, filled with whimsy. Unfortunately there is an overwhelming smell of old, sale cheese and an array of filth. Dirty napkins on the floor, used forks on the tables and crumbs everywhere. I ordered a drink, as I still needed my one cup o' coffee. A simple latte, yes?... $5 for 12 ounces of foamed milk and not a tinge of coffee taste. Politely I asked if it was made with espresso and was told, ""yes, one shot"". I beg to differ. With a name including the word coffee, they are perfectly content serving ""coffee"" for an egregious price and don't even care if it is packing the quality to match."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great addition to the Athenaeum! The redecoration and locally sourced coffees have quickly turned this into one of my favorite coffee shops in Indy!

They staff are very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. If you stop by the front desk of The Y at the Athenaeum you can pick up a discount card that gives you a free coffee after 10 purchases. 

Coat Check has a nice variety of local coffees from Tinker Roasters and they have quite a few types of drinks. The Nitro is my favorite!

Be sure to stop by and have a cup of coffee, latte, flat white, or tea and enjoy the renovated lobby area of the beautiful Athenaeum building!"
Food,4.5,OR,Recently hosted an event at RWBB in Audubon and was so pleased by it all. I had started talking to the owner months prior about reserving a portion of their outdoor space for a surprise party and we kept in contact along the way. They let me know ahead of time of events happening on Merchant street so they took special care to make sure my guests knew where to go. The staff was so kind and accommodating and made ordering beer for 20 some people effortless with a ticketing system (pre-paid). The event was so smooth and we could not be happier! We will be back soon for some pints! :)
Food,4.5,OR,"Yet another one out of the park establishment from Rebecca and Scott!  These guys know what people want, sometimes before they realize they want it. The MSA Annex is such a cool place!  Few dinning options, coffee, little artisan shops, etc. add to the environment!  We grabbed Kukai and brought it over to Westbound, grabbed a beer and a cocktail!  Yes, yes you read right, westbound has cocktails, really good ones too!

Head over and grab a cold one, explore their bottle shop and grab a seat, barside, under the stars or a bit more sheltered inside one of those cool repurposed carts."
Food,4.5,OR,"I like Municipal.  It is where the cool kids in Santa Barbara apparently go to drink wine.  This place is dripping with hipster sarcasm.  Their wine club is called ""Club Awesome.""  If you check in with the Yelp app you get ""one free high five.""  Yes the guy pouring your wine will then give you a high five.  It is bordering on pretentious, but did not quite tip over the scale for me.  The crowd is not too bad and the wines were good, but did not blow my mind.  A good stop as you are making your way through the SB wine trail."
Food,4.5,OR,"* sucky parking expensive prices good dessert *

Drip Affogato Bar is located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, which mainly means that finding parking around here will likely be both hard and expensive.

And because Drip is such a bougie place, the prices match the expensive aesthetic of the CBD and the vibe that Drip gives off. I think the price is worth it, at least to try it once because it's pretty good! It's a good place to go to for a celebration or fancy event.

I LOVE this affogato bar, it's just a slight hassle to get here & also takes a slight hit to my bank account each time."
Food,3.0,CG,Stopped by on Saturday and it was the only one in the area. There were about 4-5 people in the front and the line moved quickly. The flavor of the day was pretty good. The staff were very friendly and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I really enjoyed my coffee and the decor. I would come back to try some of their other flavors!I love this place! They have a lot of different options and they have all the normal stuff. I always feel very comfortable here and it's always clean. The coffee is great too.
Food,4.5,CG,"The White Heron Tea and Tea has the best tea in town. The fruit teas are so delicious. The staff is always friendly and the shop is clean. I love that it's within walking distance of my house. I absolutely love this place! I love how the decor is a bit too unique to me. I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional for my taste, but I love the fact that they have some cool unique drinks and tea mixes that are made in house. The coffee is great too."
Food,3.5,CG,"This is the best place to go for a quick bite of ice cream! The variety of flavors is so unique and unique!

They are always so nice and I am always happy to see them make my coffee right. They always have a good variety of things on the menu and they always have something new to try. I love the atmosphere and it is always clean. It's very easy to get to if you are looking for a quick bite.

The flavor was ok but I would get something else next time. The TeDad's was good and I would get that next time. The tart cherry was also very good. It tasted like actual maraschino cherries with small bits. The lime didn't really taste like lime. 

We came here because it is said to be a must try in St Louis. We enjoyed the concrete and would come back for the TeDad (a bigger one!) or cherry or try some other flavors."
Food,2.0,OR,"This wal-mart is staffed by the most rudest group of people i have ever met!

More than 5 occasions had I have bad experiences there with staff. I thought it was just me and maybe it was something I was doing.

Turns out the WHOLE town gets flack from these people.

I caught an attitude because I asked where the guacamoles was...

When i went to complain to the manager she followed me to ""make sure i wasn't lying""

Who are these people ? Is it a insider wal-mart cult or something? 


All I know is I hate this store and the people that work here because HELP is not in their vocabulary..


Thanks alot Wal-mart..


K-Marts looking better everyday."
Food,4.0,OR,"Love the bubble tea, smoothies, yogurt, AND food here! The boba is fresh and chewy, tea flavors are great. I just recently tried the brick toast, eel bowl, and sushi and all were surprisingly delicious! I was hesitant on trying food here since it's known for drinks and yogurt, but everyone should definitely try out the menu. Sushi is definitely comparable to popular sushi joints in town. Brick toast is amazing! Very large portion so keep that in mind. I ordered the butter and coconut flavors combined. Delish. The decor here is cute and ikea-modern. A great place to sit and chat with friends or bring your laptop to catch up on work."
Food,2.5,OR,"This walmart is pretty clean and put together  better than most walmarts. My biggest complaint and reason for never returning is the amount of checkout lines upon wanting to pay for your items. There are no self checkout lines, which would save people valuable time. There are at most 3-4 cashiers working at any given time that I have been there at multiple times a day.  Having to wait in line for 20 minutes while staff take their time to ring up items of the 2-3 people ahead of you is not acceptable. Make use of your 10-15 other, unopened registers and keep your customers happy. 

Yours truly, 
In a hurry."
Food,3.0,OR,"I've been missing the friendly crew at this Starbucks since the store closed its inside due to COVID-19 but that hasn't stopped them for being as friendly and with it one bit. Today I went thru the drive thru and ""The Chaz"" took my order and cheerfully served my order - just right I'll add!
Actually the crew there works real hard to make everyone feel welcomed and are one of the primary reasons why I enjoy spending time there for simply grabbing a snack or parking myself with my laptop and catching up on work.
Great job and keep up the great work - I speak for many that we miss seeing you all!"
Food,4.5,OR,"There are a couple of beers that are actually decent here. A really good beer should not have a bad aftertaste regardless of temperature. That posted, a few of these beers are very good chilled, but diminish as they warm up a little. The biggest negative on this place is they expect you to come to the bar to order a $5.50 pint of beer. For that money, the least the owner could do is have a wAitress or two. If he changes that, I would bump this establishment up to 4 stars. If not, pass on this place. If he can't afford a waitress at 800 to 1200 percent margin, Forget em"
Food,4.5,OR,"This place has been a lifesaver during the pandemic. Nearly all of their products have been in stock and always plenty of ice cream. It is very hard to maintain social distancing inside this place so make sure you have a good mask or try to go when it isn't busy. One of these days I'll write a comprehensive review on all of their ice cream flavors as I've had nearly every flavor they offer. My favorites are: Amaretto Chocolate Almond, Mocha Chip, and Peanut Paradise. I do think a couple of their flavors miss the mark but the most of their flavors set the bar so high they can't all be great."
Food,4.5,OR,"Nothing Bundt cakes is fire!!! PERIOD! Rather it's for family parties, work events, or for myself this place is ALWAYS a winner. The cakes no matter which size or flavor you get are consistently moist and bursting with full of flavor. The icing is spot on! On this visit I decided to go with the limited edition flavor ""Snickerdoodle"". Good lord if they still have this on the menu, this is definitely a must try!!!!! 

At this particular location, the staff is always upbeat, cheerful, and helpful. I love how they come from behind the counter to greet and help you decide. It just adds a personal touch. 5 stars worthy for sure!!!!!"

Thank you so much for making our daughters day special!The staff was friendly and helpful. I was looking for some things I had to try on my first visit. They have a lot of different options and some I haven't seen elsewhere. I ended up getting a gingerbread muffin which was very good. The staff was very nice and helpful.
Food,3.0,CG,"I'm new to the warehouse scene and I thought it was a great place to go for a couple beers.  The beers are great, but the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed and chill than most breweries.  It's a little pricey for a brewery but I think it's worth it.  They have a nice outdoor area and also a food truck out front.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend it to any beer lover!I like this place. The coffee is good, but the coffee is bad. I hate that they don"
Food,4.5,CG,"If ever in New Orleans, I'll be going back for sure.

The fruit and veggies here are top-notch, and they're fresh and tasty. The prices are a bit high, but the quality is worth it. I wish I could get some veggies here for the price. 

The deli section is pretty good too, with a lot of options. I just wish there was more vegetarian options, and they didn't have a whole lot of vegan options.I've been to this location about 3 times already, and I haven't"
Food,3.5,CG,"Ok, I'm a long time customer of the Fresh Market. I'm not sure if I'm just being a little too lazy to say, ""I don't care, you just don't care."" But I still enjoy the Fresh Market.I absolutely love the service here. I've never been treated like a customer with such rude and condescending employees. I've never had a bad experience here. I went there with my sister and it was just as good as it could be. The ice cream is amazing, the service is quick, and the employees are super"
Food,2.0,CG,Hate this dunkin donuts. Please go to the one on Virginia. And if I could give zero stars I would. The donuts are good but the service is terrible. I go to this location everyday and the girls at the drive thru are rude. I always get the same thing. I don't know how long the line has been but I never get to the window. I will never go back. Came here for the first time today. The prices are very reasonable. The store is very clean and the staff were very friendly.
Food,4.5,OR,I hadn't been in since the seating restrictions were in place but we got lucky in a Saturday afternoon and we're able to get a table. I forte until the indoor seating is super limited but they do have a patio for when it is warm enough. The space is still immaculately clean and the service is fast and friendly. They have a huge selection of their beers on tap in a wide variety of different styles as well as mixed cocktails and there's usually a food truck outside. Also happy hour daily until 5 makes this a great spot to grab a good drink for cheap if you're able to get a table!
Food,3.0,OR,"I rarely come here because it's in Metairie and I am not a fan of getting stuck in Metairie traffic because that happens to me way too often. They are two story which can be annoying if you don't know which floor the things you need are on.

I do appreciate that they are environmentally conscious and promote recycling but that is not enough to make up for all the areas where they they are not that great.

Anyway, they do have a great candle selection and their picture frames are great but it's not worth it to come here just for those things. The parking is crap and people drive/park aggressively in their parking garage."
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is delightful! It smells like waffle cones and sugar when you walk in. It's clean, bright and the staff was polite. I LOVED the flavors my friends and I tried, the double chocolate, toasted coconut and salted caramel, especially. I had half a scoop of the mint chocolate chip and while it was very tasty, it was wild! It was like actual fresh mint leaf flavor, and not the usual ""green"" mint that ice cream has - it was very tasty but I was shocked at first because my brain was not expecting fresh-crushed-in-a-mojito-mint flavor, at all. I can't wait to go back and try more - including the toasted marshmallow topping."
Food,4.5,OR,"Neat and quirky restaurant concept! It's at the end of the street that looks like a house with a huge magical garden! 

Inside, you first enter the wine and cheese selection area. There's a variety of wines to chose from (of course from around the world) and a fridge full of cheeses! After making your selection, you go to the counter to pay and pick up your wine glasses. You exit the doors to the garden, where you can purchase food (CASH ONLY!). 

I ordered the veggie rigatoni and i sure wasn't disappointed! The overall mood is relaxed, romantic, and whimsical. There are lights hung up as well as candles lit! 

I love it!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Im surprised this place wasn't more crowded on the day I came. It was a warm day and sunny. 

There is tons of seating here so it would be a great place to bring your friends. There were several groups sitting around playing games. 

There is apparently always a food truck outside as well. The day I came it was Better Box. They have a sesame chicken cheesesteak that is pretty good. I would definitely be down to try more of their food. 

The staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy helping people pick out what beers they would like. 

I live super close to here and Ill be for sure be back!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Great place to grab a local beer at reasonable prices after work. The beer tenders have been there a long time and are friendly and open to discuss beer as little or as much as you want. Rotating beers, but always have an option from Sun King and 3 Floyd's. Recently, NE IPAs are the rage so TomTap has a few to offer. Expect several IPAs, a few pale ales, a few sours, a few imperial IPAs, a stout or two, a porter, a few Belgians, a few Pilsners, a seasonal or two, about 20 beers. The beer selection is solid on the 2nd floor of the City Market. Go here over Whole Foods."
Food,2.0,OR,"I needed tires and Costco didn't have the right size. Since Walmart was close, I went there.
My problem isn't the price or service, both were OK. My problem is that after they were mounted and paid for, I was told that I would now need to go elsewhere to get the tires balanced and aligned! In fact they made me sign a release stating this.
  I've bought a lot of tires in my life and have never had to drive away without the tires and wheels being balanced and aligned.
  Shame on you, Wal-Mart, for (1) not providing these basic safety measures and (2) not informing your customers BEFORE services are rendered!"
Food,4.0,OR,"This wine and spirits is one of the biggest ones I've been to. They have a very large selection of wine as well as liquor. Had a pretty funny experience today. The security guard comes over to us, at first I thought she was making sure no one was stealing anything then she says ""What's up dog? I can't wait to get out of here, I'm bored as shit."" Leans on the glass slides down it and walks away. We looked at each other and were like wtf? Not sure if she was doing a little wine tasting of her own but it caught us off guard. Other than that this store is great."
Food,4.5,OR,"Im sure the food and the beer are fantastic, however we sat at our table for 15 minutes without even being greeted. When I got up to find an employee and ask where our server was, I was assured they would be over shortly. 5 minutes later, I tried to flag down the same person again. A few minutes later, she (still not even our server) came over and apologized, said she would at least get our drink order in. That was 20 minutes too late for us and we were unable to stay due to time constraints. Disappointed in the service, won't try to pop in for a quick beer and bite again."
Food,4.0,CG,WOW. I haven't been there before. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever meet. They are rude and will not help you. They are rude and refuse to help you. I don't know how they can do it. I can't believe they are so rude. I will never shop here again. I won't go to any other location. It's very sad that they refuse to help you. You're the worst.
Food,4.5,CG,"DO NOT COME HERE!  We will NOT be going back!!!

Thanks for the awesome experience.I absolutely love the coffee here, but the people that work there are always very rude. I have had their latte and it was very watered down. I don't know how I would go back. I have also had their orange juice which is very good. I've also had their espresso drinks and they were very good. But the coffee is way too sweet. I prefer their pastries to pastries. I'd give them a 4, but I don"
Food,4.5,CG,"I'm always reluctant to come here because the quality is just too much. However, I have been to other locations in the area and this one is by far the best. The staff is always friendly and helpful. It's a great addition to the area. This is my new favorite location. I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best coffee. It's very quiet and there's plenty of seating. The pastries are delicious! The coffee is amazing too. You can tell they use quality ingredients."
Food,4.0,CG,Micro Brew Love! + Tuesday nights. The food truck is a great place to hang out and just grab a cup of coffee and some beers. I think this place is pretty cool with a small patio and a good view of the river. I love this place. The staff is always friendly and the beer is great. I love the fact that they have a punch card. They have a great patio with games to play and an outdoor area. I always feel welcome here. They have a lot of games to play and have a fun time with friends.
Food,3.5,CG,"I hate coming in hear, especially on the weekends, and I will say that the lines move pretty quickly. 

If you are looking for some basic essentials, this is the place to go. I mean, in a grocery store, it's not really worth it. The staff is always nice, and they have the most convenient parking. There's a lot of room for sitting, and there's plenty of room to move around and get your food and beverage. I love that they have a lot of fresh produce, and I like that they have a lot of"
Food,4.5,CG,"This winery was our favorite part of the tasting. We loved all the wines, the wine and the atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and took pride in making sure we were taken care of. They had a great selection of wines, they had some great service and excellent people. The only downside was that we ended up going to 3 wineries in the area. We will definitely be back!This place is amazing! I was there for the first time and loved the atmosphere and the service! I had the matcha latte and it was delicious! I would definitely"
Food,5.0,OR,"I love the friendly staff, they always greet you with a warm hello.  They are extremely helpful.  They will keep you within your budget and won't make you feel bad about spending less than $15 on a bottle of wine.  OK so I'm not always that cheap, but it's nice to know.  If they have an item on sale they are quick to tell you about it.  I purchased a $50 bottle of Dolbe Tequilla for $30 in change.  Amazing!  Just tell them what you need it for, cooking, a party, a gift, whatever and they are quick to help with great ideas, and fabulous prices to boot!"
Food,5.0,OR,"This new location is just as delicious as the original. I was waiting for my takeout dinner order to be ready at a restaurant in the area. I decided I would have my dessert before dinner. Best decision ever. Literally, every flavor is so good. Depending on the size that you choose you can pick multiple flavors. They are great about allowing you to sample flavors until you find the perfect option. This time I ordered a small with peanut butter and chocolate and a small with cookie butter and strawberry. I strongly recommend checking out this ice cream shop if you are an ice cream lover. It's all homemade and plenty of vegan options!"
Food,4.5,OR,"If you want a hearty sized doughnut then this is a good place. All doughnuts were tasty and had a good dough to it so it didn't feel like a chore to eat a whole bunch of bread. Good ratio of topping to dough and that's pretty much all i'm looking for in a doughnut. Surprisingly all the doughnuts are vegan and it still tastes great.

Located off of 109 ave and 119st, it's in an area that you wouldn't think of having a tasty treat. The shop is so fresh and so clean that it's a good spot to visit. Go before they sell out around 1pm on any given day.

Sal says: Just Try It"
Food,4.5,OR,Visited the New Location in Madison  .  We were out celebrating a friends Birthday and the new tap room did NOT disappoint .  A wide selection of beers that's sure to have something for everyone . The servers were all very friendly and very knowledgeable about the flavors of beer and the history of the company .  Dos Perros was my favorite but others in the group liked almost all of them . A nice patio outside as well . A perfect ending to our day .  Planning on visiting a lot more often and recommend to everyone .  Thrilled that it's close to our side of town .
Food,5.0,OR,"I never thought I would ever write a review about just pudding, but here I am. The Sweet Life Bakeshop has AMAZING pudding, and I don't even like pudding. 

I stopped by since I was craving something sweet. I actually intended to get a cookie, but the lady who worked there insisted that I try the pudding. (You can actually sample every single one of their puddings). I ended getting the ""Magic"" pudding, which was a combination of vanilla, caramel, peanuts, and chocolate, and I was completely blown away. It was sweet, delicious, and basically everything I wanted in a dessert. 

I'm so glad I gave their pudding a chance. I'll definitely be back soon."
Food,4.5,OR,"Ok. This is unfortunate for the store , mot their fault but they have an obnoxious woman sitting at their door trying to get a petition against zoning signed. She is rude, aggressive and pushy. I no longer want to go to the store  because there is no way in unless you encounter her. She really needs to sit elsewhere or stop harrassing customers. I am ok with petitions but a simple no should be enough. Very sad I am not going back because I do like the store. I spike with manaher today that said he is unable to get rid of her due to the owner of shopping center put her there."
Food,4.5,CG,"It's no McMillan's, but when it comes to the food. I will say that the deli has a lot of choices. The bakery, deli, bakery, bakery, bakery, deli, bakery, bakery, bakery, bakery, coffee shop. I love to come here once in a while. The deli is the most convenient place to shop and it is a great place to go for a few things to eat or to go to on a lazy day. This is a great place for a quick bite on a hot summer day."
Food,3.0,CG,"Easily the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I will never ever go back to this location. I had a friend from out of town order a drink and it was made wrong. I told them to fix it and they gave me attitude and gave me attitude. I had a bad day and I will never go back. I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and was not disappointed! I chose the cake for my husband's birthday and it was delicious! The cake was moist, flavorful, and tasted great."
Food,3.5,CG,"Never in my life this happened. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever meet. They are rude and will not help you. I wish I could give it 5 stars. I don't know how they manage to hire them. I have never had a bad experience at this location. My husband and I went to the drive thru on a Saturday afternoon around 11:30pm and it was very busy. The line moved quickly, but the service was awful."
Food,4.0,CG,"I just can't tell you what it is. 

I love this place! I just can't get over the amazing people behind the counter and the amazing customer service. I go here every time I'm in town. I can't wait to go back!It was a lot of fun to watch the line go by and get a glass of wine while I was there. I will say I didn't care for the wines I had. The wines were a little pricey for me, but I think it is worth the price. I liked the fact that it was not"
Food,4.0,CG,"This is my go to spot for the wide variety of flavors and toppings. I usually go with a scoop of the cookie dough, but since they have a large variety of flavors, I can't really compare them to other places. The staff are always very friendly and willing to give you samples. The place is clean and nicely decorated. They have a great variety of flavors and the staff is always willing to help you decide what you want.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite is the strawberry cake, but the carrot cake is my favorite!"
Food,4.0,CG,"Just what I needed during my last visit. 

I love that they have a full sized selection of cupcakes and cakes, both of which are very tasty. They also have gluten free and vegan cupcakes. 

I also enjoy the variety of flavors offered. The texture of the cake is very good and it's a great way to bring back a friend or family. I love that they have a variety of cupcakes. 

I also love the fact that they have a huge variety of baked goods. I've never been disappointed with a cake I"
Food,4.0,CG,"I dislike this kroger so much. The employees are friendly and the produce is always fresh. 

The only thing I don't like about this kroger is that it's so close to my house. It's a bit on the expensive side and I still find myself paying a little more for the quality of the produce. I can't wait to go back and check out the other stuff.Love the beer, the atmosphere and the location. I always feel welcome here. The staff is friendly and helpful. The only downside is that they are not open 24"
Food,3.5,OR,"The store access may be tough to get there if you come from south of Bruce B Down. One good thing they have parking lot is big enough. Especially during Coronavirus period. This store is busy. Parking is full of customers to visit this store. 

The wine and beer may not the cheapest in town. But it has the special may be worth a visit. I got two bottle of Pinot Noir from Russian River Valley region. I also got the special deal of the beer - Goose Island IPA. The check out line is long. But everyone keep a distance. When get close to the payment teller, it is set to minimum six feet apart."
Food,3.0,OR,"Had ordered a mini sandwich tray for 20 25 people called on Saturday August 14 and gave my order to Allison the deli manager ask for order to be ready for pick up at 3 on Sunday the 15th was told would be ready when I arrives to pick up order they couldn't even find the order , if it wasn't for the great girl in the deli who worked hard to get it done and the amazing assistant store manager Chris for his awesome customer skills and for compensating me I would have walked out and never return to that store again which I shop at 2 to 3 times a week , thanks again"
Food,4.5,OR,"Visited for the first time this weekend and kicking myself for not coming sooner. This is definitely, by FAR, my FAVORITE brewery in town (sorry for the caps but it was just that damn good!). We had the flights and there was not a single beer I didn't love. The location itself is so badass. Between the loungy seats and the artwork and the adorable dogs that people brought in, there was no better place I wanted to be that day.

Beer: 6/5 - heck yeah!! I brought home a Pilsner growler and a Porter one. Don't leave the brewery without them!
Service: 5/5 - super friendly 
Location: 6/5 - my new slice of heaven, I'm completely smitten!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Uncle Louie G's food truck visited our neighborhood tonight and they were awesome! I couldn't decide between the churros and Italian Ice, so I just ordered both. A churro order came with two, so I even shared with my husband. I got cherry and kiwi Italian Ice and it had a ton of flavor and real cherries in the ice! It is the best Italian Ice I have enjoyed since moving to Florida! My husband ordered the brownie sundae which he said was delicious and he said the brownie was amazing. Our fur children enjoyed pup ""sundaes"" (i.e. whipped cream) Enza was a pleasure to chat with as well. We hope to have them back soon!"
Food,2.0,OR,My beef is with the pharmacy tech gentleman who completely lied to me when asked if my husbands medication was discounted by Good Rx. We were charged $117 for a cholesterol pill! After returning to our car I looked up on the good RX app. To find out this medication is only $67 on the good RX. After returning to the store I had to go to three different areas at the pharmacy in order to change the credit card charges and receive discount.  This pharmacy tech has no empathy and could care less about people!!  Needless to say our prescriptions will now be transferred to a store where we can trust the pharmacy.
Food,4.5,OR,I was very excited to try.  Walked in at 2:50 pm I guess.  They informed us they had already shut down the espresso machine but didn't explain why.  We ordered drinks anyway.  While they were making the drinks I asked about the make up stand up front.  I got a very vague answer about a business within a business.  I paid with a credit card.  My friend tried to pay with cash and was informed that they don't accept cash.  We got our drinks and sat down.  Less than a minute later they informed us they were now closed and we had to leave.  Terrible experience.
Food,4.0,OR,"World Market is packed with all kinds of finds- from furniture to kitchen ware, bath accessories, patio items, paper goods and even food item...you can literally find it all. Every time I step foot into this store, it turns into an all afternoon affair with little reward. It's just not for me. Sure, prices are low, but I also find that the quality isn't very good, in my opinion. I have found some fun items during the holiday season- like ornaments and wrapping paper. The paper supply and party supply section is definitely my favorite section. Tons of cute finds in that area. This particular store has really great customer service and folks are super helpful!"
Food,4.0,CG,"Pricey but cute. Every time I go, the workers are super friendly and helpful. I love the variety of flavors and the prices are a bit high but the ice cream is great.I'm so excited to have found this place in the neighborhood. I love the selection of craft beers and the people working there are so friendly and helpful. I can't wait to come back and try more of their beers!Love the beer here. The bartender is very friendly and always willing to give us suggestions on what to get. You can also order flights or growlers for you to try"
Food,4.0,CG,Great selection of sweets located in an industrial park area. I will definitely be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and she said no.  I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.  I just walked away and went to the register to pay.  I told her I had been waiting for 20 minutes and she just said no.  I stood there for about 10 minutes and was
Food,4.0,CG,"I'm sweet on this place, but I wouldn't give it a five star rating. I ordered a large iced latte with a shot of espresso, and it was great. The barista was extremely friendly and helped me out. The shop is really cute and has a very cozy feel. I'd come back to try some of their food.I came here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised! I love the atmosphere and the music. The prices are very reasonable. The coffee is amazing, and the coffee is great too. I'm not a huge coffee drink"
Food,4.5,CG,"This is a place you should go if you want to take a break from your day. 

The employees are all nice, helpful and polite, and the store is clean and well kept. 

There are a few coffee shops in the area that I would recommend for a coffee shop. 

I did get a free mocha with a free muffin. I was quite surprised to see that they had an option for ""free"" coffee, so I went with that. 

The menu is limited, but they also have a coffee bar."
Food,4.5,CG,"After finally making it out, I was greeted by a friendly, polite, welcoming, personable young woman named Catherine. The bakery, which is located inside a shopping center, is located right next door to the entrance. 

I ordered the chocolate cake donut. The donut was a bit sweet for my taste, but I had to try it. I've had the traditional glazed donut with the buttercream frosting on top. It was good, but I don't like the buttercream frosting on top. I also noticed that it was not topped with"
Food,4.5,CG,"I can't say anything about this place, but the prices are a little higher than the local store.

I had a coupon for a free mini chocolatier, and it was worth it.  It was a little pricey for what it is, but it was worth it.  They also sell a variety of pastries, and I have heard they sell cookies and pastries.  I will definitely be back for more treats.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite is the strawberry cake, but the carrot cake is my favorite!"
Food,4.5,CG,"Leo's is a local favorite.  The quality of their product is consistent, and the staff is always so friendly.  The bakery, deli, bakery, bakery, bakery, and bakery are among my favorites.  The staff is always friendly and welcoming.  I love coming here with my friends.  They have the most delicious desserts and treats and they are always so sweet.  I always get the same thing every time I go.  I like that they have a separate section for cakes that are always made fresh.  You can also get any of their coffee"
Food,4.5,CG,"I ordered a guava green tea with boba and it was a nice, refreshing drink.  The other two had the pearls, which were also delicious.  I was very impressed by the customer service and the quality of the drinks.  I would definitely come back here again!This is a great place to come and grab a drink or two and bring to a friend or family. They have great food and beer, as well as wine and beer. It's very dog friendly, and they offer dog treats. The staff is friendly and helpful.This is a great little"
Food,4.0,CG,"I write this review primarily because of the fact that they are a franchise that makes the customer feel like a customer.  The people who work here are the most unhappy and rude people I have ever encountered.  It's clear that they do not care about their jobs or their customers.  

The service is the most awful I have ever seen.  There is a line of 15 people in the store and it seems like the only reason I don't give them five stars is because they are so rude.  The employees are rude, they don't know how to do"
Food,4.5,OR,"Came here early Sunday morn of opening week. home run!  There was already a steady stream of Customers but there was a very cool bagel kitchen window to watch the creation process. great distraction while  waiting to order. esp if you have kids in tow. The breakfast sandwich. went all in with the Uncle Leo (Seinfeld shout out?) on an everything, and it was delish. Can't wait to get back for a dozen to go!  Also really liked the neighborhood vibe and mix of customers on a pleasant Sunday morning. Grew up not too far from here and had seen the write up in the Inky. now live in western burbs, but Barts was well worth the drive."
Food,4.5,OR,"Great little stop for dessert! Staff is super friendly and lets you sample as much as you'd like! Some unique flavors including pandan and lychee rose.

A scoop in a bowl comes with a candy topping and a drizzle. I got strawberry with marshmallows and a condensed milk drizzle! Yum! Real chunks of strawberry and the drizzle was just a touch of sweetness. 

Hubby got a chocolate waffle (they were out of regular!) with cookies and cream and enjoyed it.  Beware the waffle creations are HUGE!  

Had a creation called a coconut bowl with ice cream + sticky rice + unlimited toppings that sounded amazing but it's $8 and huge. So I passed, but was tempted!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I found this place by accident while exploring Nashville. It's an unassuming candy shop, but don't be fooled. You are greeted as soon as you walk in the door. Southern hospitality at its finest. The candies are delicious, but I will forewarn you, you are going to end up buying more than you expected. Then when it's gone, you'll be disappointed you didn't buy more while you were there. Go ahead and treat yourself! If you spend too much money there, they'll send you home with a sample of something you didn't buy. It'll end up being delicious and you'll add it to your shopping list for the next time you're there. It's a delicious, vicious cycle!"
Food,3.0,OR,"It's rare, but I went inside as the drive thru was about 10 cars deep.   This store is the FIRST I have every experienced where they made my drink based of the line INSIDE!!   Normally, if there isn't a line inside (this is all Starbucks in general) and at least three cars waiting to order, you win the game by going inside since (it always seems) only one person is allowed to use the espresso machine at once.   At this location, register dude just walked over, made my drink, and bam!  3 min.  in and done.   Also, they had the new TN mug, so hurray for me."
Food,4.0,OR,"Such a great winery at an amazing location! I went here on a Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend. I called ahead to make a reservation the day of, which I would recommend to do. They have a ton of great selections to choose from. We selected their Down Home red wine, which is one of their sweet wines. The winery sits near a lake, which makes for some spectacular views! This was my second time here, and both times they have had live music. Also, they allow you to bring your own food too, which is a really nice feature not all wineries offer! Overall, I definitely recommend checking this place out for a nice relaxing afternoon!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Wow!! Delicious Gelato. Their flavors are distinctive and tasty! This is a fun place to cool off on warm days and grab a sweet treat.

They have plenty of seating (indoors and outdoors), even a small area in the back to kick back and relax. You could study here, do some work, read a book, etc. Additionally, there is a seating area enclosed in glass for a quieter experience if you're there for study/work. 

Their menu is fun and flavorful! So many options for things to try. The staff is incredibly friendly as well. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a place to hang and enjoy something sweet! They also offer coffee and other desserts as well."
Food,4.0,OR,"Came in with some friends from the beer industry and had to really push to make this stop. Man you guys did me wrong, I really wanted to love this place. It's a huge space with tons of potential but with the rude service no wonder they were dead. At first I thought it was one bartender but the other one was coming off short and rude as well. We went and did the beer tour and he seem like  he was already lite. So we booked it to look for another brewery, we had maybe two beers each. As the beer goes I had a IPA and a pale both tasted average to my liking."
Food,3.5,OR,"So far not my favorite convention center. I'm attending IFT here this week.

There are plentiful bathrooms but they are all spread out, you either have to exit the exhibition hall to find them or go to the sides of the hall. They are well marked at least, but be prepared to walk at least 5 minutes to find one.

Not all of the doors are accessible as well, you can exit the hall anywhere but security might make you go back into the hall to a different entrance.

Food,4.0,OR,"I went into this Safeway for the first time this weekend and I really liked it.
I generally don't shop at Safeway, but I don't really have anything against it. I really like shopping here because you can see your savings. When we went here, we had a pretty big shop and we bought a lot of sale items. The receipt had our savings totalled at the bottom and it stated that we saved $26!! I couldn't believe it.

Safeway is pretty well laid out as well. I always have an easy time finding stuff and the selection is pretty good too.

This Safeway was not very busy, which was really nice. It may be a switch in my household!"

I've never been treated so poorly. I've never had a bad experience here. I will be back.I used to love this place but it's so very sad that they closed. I went in hoping to buy some produce but they were out of everything."
Food,4.0,OR,This was my second visit to Flix Brewhouse. Overall a comfortable place to watch a movie and have a couple of drinks.  The food was not impressive.  We tried a pizza and the spinach artichoke dip.  It served its purpose but I would enjoy many other restaurants food for this same price.  The beer selection was good and our service was good.  We decided to go slightly last minute and the seat selection was only the first 3 rows remaining.   In future visits if I can't get a seat in row E or above I will not go to that show. The seats were comfortable just too close to the screen.
Food,2.5,OR,"I Rate This Walmart Location As Average.  The Employees Are Honest And Knowledgeable But Rarely Smile (As If They Are Not Happy To Be Working At Walmart).

Inventory Seems To Be An Issue, With Many Items Such As Soda And Cleaning Products Being Of Stock On A Regular Basis, I Need To Make A Second Unnecessary Trip A Few Days Later Or Purchase The Items At A Competitor.

The Location Of This Walmart Is Convenient But The Inventory Issues Offset The Convenience Of Location.  If Store #5255 Can Correct Their Inventory Issues, Walmart Would Be The Only Place I Shop.  Until That Happens, I'll Be Shopping At Various Stores To Get ""In Stock"" Items Which I Need."
Food,4.0,OR,"I don't what it is about this Starbucks - location, drive-thru or what, but it is always jumping! I went on a Wednesday at 7 pm, and a few days later on Saturday at 11:30 am, and both times the drive-thru line was long, the line in-store was long, and almost all of the seats were filled. On both trips the line moved quickly, and I was greeted with the wonderful trademark customer service that is expected from Starbucks. 

There's not much else to say, the service, drinks and food are consistent with other Starbucks across the city, but out of all the ones that I've visited, I'd have to say this is the best for people watching!"

It's more a smaller farmer's market and you have to get there early to get good fresh produce because vendors do routinely sell out. I love the atmosphere and the vendors are all friendly and knowledgeable. We try to get all our produce here. Occasionally we have to venture out to the St Phillip's Plaza Farmer's Market to get a couple things. If you are new to Farmer's Markets this would be a good one to start with so you don't feel overwhelmed. 

Bonus: Planet of the Crepes has been showing up here routinely, so you can get breakfast or lunch while shopping!"
Food,4.0,OR,How does this place get its reputation for good selection and low prices? It's a sham. I found wines on the website that I liked but they were not on the shelf. I have heard from two informed sources that TW keeps the good stuff in the back for the special customers. As far as prices they were 50% higher on two high end Scotch's that I wanted to buy. Talisker 10 and Ledig 10. $25 more. They have plenty of cheap stuff and they push their low end wines. But as far as selection and price on good stuff they should be called Total Lyin. This was my first visit and it will likely be my last.
Food,2.5,OR,"So we have ""special"" COVID-19 hours, so that staff can stock and clean. However, they stock, clean, and shop during the limited hours that they're open. I recently walked in one morning to the cooler section blocked off to do the floors. You expect that when you shop over night, but not when the store is on some old school hours for special cleaning, disinfecting, and stocking. If they're closed at night for this purpose, then should it be cleaned and stocked when the store opens. So frustrating that we make all these changes during this time to pack people in your store use one set of doors for entrance and exit and then don't do what's advertised."

Other places put too much ice (which clogs up the straw) or cannot seem to balance all the ingredients just right (eg, overdoing the protein blend). However, every smoothie I've gotten in this Mt Laurel location has been PERFECT. The consistency is always on point and the flavor always hits the spot. To top it all off, the customer service here is ALWAYS superb. Great staff.

Yes, there were lines in the morning, but consistent morning kickstarts were what we were looking for (and needed) so this location was worth the wait.

Thanks for the morning food and beverage Kyle!"
Food,3.5,OR,"Surly service, excellent cookies. I loved the cookies but not the customer service. When I ordered two cookies for myself and my friend, I asked the lady to put them in separate bags. Judging from the nasty look she gave, I was out of line. When we ordered ice cream that seemed to annoy her too. I was expecting her to snap. Maybe she was just having a bad day but that doesn't justify making customers feel uncomfortable, especially at an establishment such as this: a place where people go to be happy. Is friendly service at an ice cream and cookie shop too much to expect? If so, then please don't leave a tip jar on the counter."
Food,3.5,OR,What can I say...of course this store has all the staples and everything in between but I feel like this company takes advantage of the customer at every opportunity.  The cashiers will charge you the non sale price and try to get away with it if you aren't paying FULL attention.  This happens almost every time I shop there when buying things that are supposed to be on sale.  I have to scrutinize my receipts every time because things on sale don't get charged correctly or the cashier is supposed to use a coupon they are supposed to have in their drawer.  Make life simple Albertsons get rid of your gimmicks and stop this nonsense.

I am actually going to try to purchase something so that I can eat better that next week. If you relate, this is the market for you too!

Often times, they won't even make a sandwich for you. I know they are short staffed but is this a reason to treat customers so nastily? This store has a goal to bring in the same money the Truckee store makes. Since the shelves are often bare, I would say they will never meet this goal. I have gone in the early morning, at lunch time, early afternoon and never are the shelves stocked with wraps, sandwiches, salads, etc. You can't make money if you have nothing to sell."

You can't come here and just try 1 flavor. I got the 3 mini scoop trio. It was only $6. Brambleberry crisp, lavender wildberry and sugar plum. All their flavors are unique and not your typical basic ice cream. My favorite was the brambleberry. There's pieces of crisp in it. The lavender wild berry was ok. Sugar plum was interesting. There was pieces of cookie or cake dough in it I think. Do stop by here for ice cream when in Tampa!"

Food,3.5,OR,"Went on a Saturday night and waited maybe 30 minutes in line. Concept was ok, they used liquid nitrogen to rapidly freeze the base you choose. I got the premium base which was creamy. The disappointing thing was the flavors - I chose pistachio, chocolate, and brownie batter- which were artificial and the pistachio was colored a vibrant, unpleasant green color that clung to the teeth and hard palate. The flavors were haphazardly squirted into the mixing bowl and the pistachio flavor was completely overwhelming. I went with my two friends, both of which ordered mocha flavoring that was not detectable. I ended up throwing away mine without finishing, finding the sight and viscosity of the formidable green coloring unpalatable."
Food,4.0,OR,"While this shop is a clean, convenient place to pick up a quick sweet, it sadly didn't satisfy. Heard this place was out of Beverly Hills, so giving two stars as I recognize my expectations may have been set for a higher quality experience. Here is what I discovered:

- Shop is small and unattractive (nothing quaint or charming)
- Cakes are small, dry, and lack design
- Very little flavor diversity
- Expensive - and it costs extra for to go packaging

I highly recommend going to Chocolate Pi on Howard for an amazing experience that is creative and not mass produced. If in St Pete, head to Swah-ray on Central Ave - also a beautiful shop under ownership that really cares about quality."

She didn't wash her hand BEFORE either. After she heard my orders (ordered 4, one taro, mango, matcha and thai) she rolled her eyes and sighed. She also didn't greet me and she was talking to 2 other girls while working. She ignored the customer but was all smiley talking to her friends. She had black hair, up in a messy bun. Didn't have time to ask for her name as I was in a hurry to leave. Never coming back to this nasty place again."

The staff seemed to be confused about their current policy and also seemed annoyed to have conversations with us.  I will say that the service was not bad.  The only reason I gave a star is because the service was very friendly.  The beer selection is limited.  They don't have any food. "
Food,4.5,CG,"A great find!  My husband and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a drink and the place was so cute. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was so chill. The only thing that was disappointing was that the tables were dirty. I would come back to try their other drinks and hang out here again. I would recommend stopping by if you're in the area!I love this place! I came here to do a quick dessert and I was a little disappointed by the service. I had to wait a little bit for my drink, which was about half full."
Food,3.5,CG,"Ok, so i've heard good things about the coffee and tea.

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is bright. The place is clean and modern, and the inside is very clean.

The store is in a very cool part of town. I always look forward to going back and checking out their outdoor seating area. I'm sure i will be back for more!I love this place! I came here to do a quick dessert and I was a little hesitant because I don't have a sweet tooth. I ended up getting the strawberry shortcake with a fruity pebble"
Food,4.5,OR,Gourmet doughnuts anyone? I went with the intention of getting 3 but had to buy more since they all sounded so good and my grandkids live doughnuts. I had a bite of each one and they all had good flavor (with the exception coffee twist could've had a bit more coffee flavor but was still a good twist). The chai doughnut was excellent with a light creamy chai flavored filling and a bit of crunchy topping. My grandkids had twinkling eyes for the fluffier nutter but they were out so they settled on the s'mores which they loved. Cranberry orange was good too and honestly they were all good! Fun place offering games but check the covid standards. Fun place.
Food,2.0,OR,"I waited 10 minutes...watching 4 people behind the deli counter. I had the next number to be called. I asked...after waiting a number of minutes if I HAD to use kiosk or could  I simply order there. They said you have to take a number. I told them I already did. They said, we're busy...we'll be there soon. I then asked if they had called any numbers and I was told ""we've called all sorts of numbers. We'll, that was it. I left the store and I won't be back. I have shipped at Giant for years and have noticed the service deteriorating over years...not months. This is the Lionville, PA store. I hope someone in Giant management reads this!!!!"
Food,4.5,OR,"You can seriously never go wrong with Graeters! Some of the best ice cream around! I had a birthday reward from their rewards club so we decided to try the fishers location since it was the only one we hadn't been to yet in Indy. Very nice, clean, open location. Looks pretty new. There was quite a line, slow moving but the staff was friendly and helpful. I had no idea you receive a free, regular sundae as their birthday reward which is super nice and generous. I tried the 1870 (I think that's the name!) because it has my favorite black raspberry ice cream! It was so good! Their whipped cream is amazing too - tastes really homemade and decadent!"
Food,5.0,OR,"I LOVE this yogurt product! I visit the farm to buy the plain normal fat yogurt. Their cows are pastured Jersey cows, eat organic and probably get bovine spa treatments which leads them to create tasty milk (I'm being facetious).

The farm smells like a farm and isn't decor'ed out for tourism. The farm doesn't seem to offer any kind of guided experience if you visit (that I know of!), but you can sometimes see the cows, and can pick up other goodies like heavy cream, cheddar cheese, beef tallow, and local meat products.

Yogurt here is $3.50 for a tub, versus $4-5 in nearby supermarkets. Parking is available on site, and the farm store is across the street from the Waldorf School."
Food,4.0,OR,"If either the quality or service was good, I would give it an extra star, but both sucked. Vanilla ice quality tasted like it's one month old. There's an option on menu that says we can warm up the cookie to make the cookie more warm and chewy? She did it less that 20 seconds. No warming at all. Same with my friends sandwich. She was not welcoming at all. Nobody was behind us. Around 8pm. I understand if she's lazy, then tell us the cookie warmer isn't working! Lol. Overall taste like old ice cream. $8 and I barely at 1/3 of the sandwich. Cold stone taste 100xs better. Wish I took a picture but I was so disappointed ."
Food,4.0,OR,"Friendly faces, delicious suds, super fair prices, a little insight into the brewing process, and proud owners whose pride shows in their work. The space is a little weird in that, the night of my visit there was only a few tables, no music, lots of children, and no patio or outside area to patronize. Other than that, I'm going to agree, what's not to like? 

The Noche Dulce and IPA were pretty outstanding.  The freshness is readily apparent and really altered the tasting experience for me. So good I want to hydrate with it, but tasty enough for respectful restraint. 

Don't forget they're only open limited hours.  I'm crossing my fingers that Borderlands really becomes something in Tucson."
Food,4.5,OR,"Below average ice cream with owners who can't take criticism via google review and try to claim you're a secret shopper from a competitors ice cream business, lmao! Idiots. Sundaes is our go to because they use QUALITY ingredients, best whip cream I have ever had. Leo's whip cream tasted like water and they claim quality. Ha! We like to try different ice cream places and we're severely let down last night. Right when I left a fair 2 star review, they replied back immediately bitter and accused me of working or being a secret shopper for Sundaes. Smh. LOOK ELSEWHERE. Plus, you need to a baseball dad and drive a lifted Jeep anyway to come here. Done with this place."
Food,4.5,OR,"Fantastic neighbourhood bakery!

I often drive from 30mins away just to shop at this great bakery.
They have amazing pastries, great prices on food and a large variety of all the great Portuguese snacks my dad used to always buy.  They sell frozen foods, salted cod, olives, great variety of Portuguese olive oils, Traditional sausage, a deli section where you can get cold cuts for sandwiches and they have some warm items for sale also.

Everytime I am there, there is quite a few locals in the seating areas having coffee with friends. Reminds me of Portugal and this is a very nice feeling. The bakery is busy with the regulars and it is always worth the drive.

Highly recommend the Pastais De Nata!"
Food,3.5,OR,"Mmm, they should call these smoothies ""soothies.""  They specialize in smoothies that mostly have orange sherbet or yogurt as a base, but you can choose to have just fruit.  Most fruit includes bananas or strawberries but you can choose differently too.  You get a free boost; just specify which one you want.  A lot of their smoothies are 300 calories and around $4 for the 16 ounce size which is so small!

I like the consistency of their smoothies.  They taste almost like an Eegee's but slurpable through a straw.  The orange cream is pretty good as are the ones with peach and pineapple.  I definitely come here when I need a treat close by."
Food,4.5,CG,"I'm going to say this is a great place to stop for a cup of coffee. I ordered the coffee and it was delicious. The barista was very nice and the place is clean.

Food,4.5,CG,"Felt like a Denver brewery, but I wouldn't say I will be back. I was just in town visiting friends and I wanted a solid beer but the brewery was so much better than the place. I ordered the flight and I got a flight. My boyfriend got the IPA which was also great. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The bartenders were very friendly and helpful. They even had a few beers on tap. I'm really glad I came back to this brewery. I've been to this store a few times. I love that they have a parking lot in front."
Food,3.5,CG,"Funny Monica was here recently!

I had an amazing time! We were in town for a couple of hours and she suggested we go to the grocery store and get the best customer service. She made sure we were well stocked and in good condition. The store was clean and organized. She also made sure we were in and out within the most reasonable time frame.

The staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. The place is small and small, but the inside is very large. If you like coffee, this is your place.This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. They never answer my phone or phone, they never have the drinks I ordered. I also go there just for the coffee and drink. I'm not sure what happened with this location, but they are close to my house. I will never go back to this location. I will just go to"
Food,4.5,CG,"So the only other Kilwins that has the same recipe. I will say that the reason I go to Kilwins is because I am a bit of a vegetarian, so it is pretty much a family run business. 

I came here for the first time today and had the first time a couple of times. I was impressed by the variety of options they offer. I got the coconut milk base, which I love. I also got a large chocolate covered banana nut milk base that was very tasty. I also got a half-sweet banana nut muffin that was just ok. 
"
Food,4.5,OR,"Love this wonderful gem.  It's getting more and more popular as Fishtown gets solid and more ""mainstream""  further and further into Kensington and over towards Aramingo as a neighborhood. Stop by and treat yourself to one of their Heirloom 'Maters mid-summer--a little more expensive than the super market obviously, but well worth it and you're supporting a local business. You can also get some supplies for your DIY terrarium while you're there:)  Staff is uber friendly and helpful and one time they happily stayed open late to help me choose some veggies--all with a smile I might add. I've also heard they have a great seasonal veggie and fruit share and that it's excellent, but haven't tried it myself."
Food,2.5,OR,"This is one of my favorite Sams to come too, been coming here for years. Easy parking, not as crowded as the other ones. Today I even opened up a credit card here so there will be no more debit cards only or cash for me. I always purchase something from the food bar, everything up there is cheap & BIG! Yu get yur money's worth. Today was the 1st I ever tried their burgers, it took about 10 mins to cook but it was good.  From pretzels to hot dogs, all comes out juicy. Staff always seems to be nice and there have been a couple of small problems in the past but nothing to keep me from stop coming."
Food,4.0,OR,"Great selection of vino and alcohol. Anything you can't find? Just ask them and they will order it for you. Staff in the wine department is really knowledgeable. They also have a cheese and chocolate section to pair with your wine. 

Only thing I HATE about going here is that every single time I get rung up by any of the cashiers, they literally bend the crap out of my license to the point that it is bent when it's given back to me. I'm sorry but the flexibility of the plastic does not authenticate my license. Please stop doing this cause ain't nobody got the time to go to the dmv to get another license cause y'all snapped mine in half."
Food,4.0,OR,"Maaaaan, I wish I was a rich South City hipster. Then I could afford to shop here.

I just spent $20 on some cereal, ice cream, and juice. Seriously? Seriously.

Tiny and cute and I'm all for what they're about, but Jesus Tapdancing Christ they are expensive. Plus I was a little annoyed that there was stuff that Schnuck's carries, but they tacked on a couple extra bucks just for shits and grins.

The kind of place where I might discover some unique hard-to-find organic locally-made treat (the Serendipity strawberry sorbet is delicious! I wanna try that coconut ice cream next) but not to do your regular shopping. Not only is it pricey, but their selection isn't variable enough for that. But worth checking out."
Food,4.0,OR,"Oh my gosh ! I will religiously visit monthly just to have the amazing ""freak shake"" that Bake'n babes has to offer. The presentation is always top notch, the cake is always huge ( worth your money ), and the shake itself so delicious! 

A perfect way to end a nice date, Sunday lunch date... okay you can visit everyday and be the happiest person ever! 

The service is amazing! The desserts are amazing, and the taste SO DELICIOUS! 

This is my personal go to dessert place in Tampa Bay ! Thank you Bake'n Babes for bringing quality desserts, amazing taste, and so much creativity.

Food,4.5,OR,"I've been looking for a place where I can meet people over a ""drink"" that doesn't contain alcohol and drunk idiots.. I found it! 
The staff here is very informative and explained everything to me since I was a newbie to kava and kratom. I've brought many friends here including my dad and we love it.
It's a very relaxed atmosphere with board games, video games, relaxed couches, a bar, corn toss and more.
I recommend ordering the 50/50 kava for mind and body. You will get a relaxed feeling.
The cost of a kava is $3-$3.50 and kratom is $5

We were happy to find this one. We had the opportunity to try a few flavors and the flavor was so good. The peach sorbet was so good. 

I can't wait to come back.Great location with great service. I have to say it's a bit over priced for what you get.

The wine is truly amazing and I look forward to trying more of their wines. This is a MUST-visit if you are in SB!One of the best ice cream places around! I had the caramel sundae and my husband had the peach ice cream. Both were delicious. The prices are very reasonable. The staff is friendly and helpful. The only downside is that they are not open 24 hours!I'm a huge fan"
Food,4.5,CG,"This is a nice local brewery. The beer is good but it's also a small tap room.

Food,2.0,OR,"We used to use this pharmacy regularly but in the last two months they have had terrible service. I called for a prescription at 10 am one morning and had to wait over 20 minutes when I tried to pick it up at 6 pm that evening when I had been promised it would be ready by 4 pm. When I asked to speak to a manager regarding the situation, I was told the manager and regional manager were aware of the situation. The clerk told me they were under staffed and there was nothing that cod be done. Unfortunately I had the same experience a few weeks later. I have since switched to the Raley's across the street and couldn't be happier."
Food,4.0,OR,"Let me start by saying I love coffee.
After nearly 7 years in Manhattan and 3 in LA, I'm accustomed to finding some good spots with great coffee.  My preference is a combination or really good drinks and an atmosphere that makes me want to hang out and create, read, talk, or think.  Granted this was my first trip here, but this one definitely fits the bill for my preferences.  

I always test a new place with something simple, like how good their vanilla latte is and this one was excellent.  I wouldn't say it's worth driving out of your way for, but if you're in the area and looking for a nice, cozy coffee shop this will definitely do."
Food,4.5,OR,"Area 5.1 Winery is definitely different from other tasting rooms that I have been to. It has more of a sports bar feel with some funky decorations. Their tasting is 5 for $10. Some of the whites were pretty good, but the reds really fell flat for me. Being a red wine fan, it was pretty disappointing.

Also, as reviewers mentioned previously, they do pour their wines into the same glass over and over. It gave me the impression that the tasting room cares more about the hip atmosphere than the quality of the wine tasting experience.

I will give this place points for experimenting with different varietals. It's cool to try something different and local. And the value is not too bad. Three stars."
Food,5.0,OR,"Who knew gluten free desserts could be so good. Happened to come across this bakery stand at the riverside farmers market and I am so glad I did. Eva, the baker/owner explained all her available cakes, sugars and jams. She bakes up something different every week and her options for the week is posted on her Instagram page. I chose the Fondant au chocolat cake and the the French almond pear cake. Absolutely delicious. The cakes were moist, with the perfect sweetness.  The best part is she uses clean ingredients - I couldn't believe the cakes were gluten free. So decadent! If you haven't tried Lowenkind Bakery cakes, you definitely have to. Delicious and Eva was so friendly. Loved her French accent."
Food,4.5,OR,"Maya sells their own confections along with chocolate bars from other chocolatiers. The confections vary and the selection of bars has a unique quirkiness towards more untraditional producers.

As a chocolate snob and not easily seduced, I generally walk-in, sniff (and don't like what I smell), look around (and don't like what I see), and then leave. I did this at a chocolate shop further north on State Street before. So the fact that I stuck around and bought chocolate is a favorable nod for Maya. But, I wasn't completely sold because its selection and prices are not that inviting. For example, the Francois Pralus bars are $9.50 each. That's $43 per pound. It's a sign that I can't afford the Santa Barbara lifestyle."
Food,4.5,OR,"BEST ICE CREAM IN NASHVILLE!!

You can not go wrong with Jeni's! With several locations spread out around town, this all natural grass fed cows ice cream will BLOW YOUR MIND. seriously!

With a variety of flavors, some far out there, some surprising combinations, you will be impressed by Jeni's creations. Whether it's a solo trip, friends night out, family time, or date night; you're always in for a treat. Be prepared to wait in line - they do a great job of moving it along, but then again. You can sample as many flavors and drink plenty of cucumber water until you decide. Try it out and see for yourself, you will not regret it! Still the best in town years later."
Food,3.5,OR,"No Safeway is a cheap place to shop, but it is the closest grocery store to where I live. The thing is, you have to know how to shop at Safeway. Look for flyer specials and get yourself a club card since the savings you will get can put a pricey item into cheap territory. 

I've never had trouble finding what I need and the stores layout makes sense. The service at the Deli can be a little spotty but the quality makes it worth it. Also, unlike other places, they actually have staff at their tills so you won't spend forever in line. 

Parking is never a problem and I like that their carts are only a quarter instead of a dollar."
Food,4.0,OR,"I was awaiting for the 42 bus to take me downtown to Walnut Street Theatre and I spotted this deli while looking for bus. I was hungry after theatre and decided I was to hungry to wait for food so I tried that night after stepping off bus. Quick Stop deli is convenience store with a deli counter where you can buy sandwiches and hoagies and lunch meat. I had turkey hoagie with provolone cheese. It was great! The prices are affordable and they are quick. Yup ! You can get 6 inch or foot long sub, plus other bread for regular club sandwich. I will definitely come back. Nice to know I have Mom and Pop type deli store a block away."
Food,4.5,CG,I arrived to Fox Wine and Spirits and the store was empty.  When I got to the front of the store the clerk was wearing a mask and the employee was wearing a mask.  She was wearing her mask in a long thin thin thick.  This is the first time that I have seen a woman with a mask and she was wearing a mask on her face.  She was wearing a mask and she was wearing a mask on her face.  It was very unprofessional and it was very upsetting.  I will never be going back to this store again.

Food,4.0,CG,I came to this theater and it was the worst experience I have ever had. I was just in a rush and the server didn't know what to do and didn't seem very friendly. She was rude and just kept yelling at us for no reason. This is my first time at this theater and I will never come back. I will never be back to this theater again. I will say I went there with my sister for the first time and I have a hard time deciding on what to get since I don't have a lot of options. They had about 6 different flavors and a few seasonal flavors.

We also had the chicken and pork roll"
Food,2.5,OR,Not very good Service I know it's Walmart and we all go there cuz it's cheap but for all the money they make I would think the could pay the workers more so they could hire better people who cared just a little bit. And not have to scrape the bottom on the workforce pool for people who will work for bad pay. But I'm not happy when I can't find something there and know I have to ask anybody walking by who I know don't work in that Dep and will just say hold on I will get somebody or I will find out as they never come back. Very few helpful employees there and even less who care about there job/Job performance.
Food,1.5,OR,"This place is beyond disgusting and should really shut down or completely fire and restaff/revamp the whole place.

I have heard employees yelling and cussing at one another and even told them how unprofessional it is but they still don't fix the issue.

Bathrooms are constantly dirty and smelly. The cashiers are BEYOND SLOW not to mention they never have registers open.

I went in yesterday and bought mandarin oranges to come home and find out they are expired back in June 2015. Disgusting! The lady behind me also had problems with old food. She bought food and found it was rotten.

I always find rotten produce or expired produce. Half the time they have things not in stock.  

Flat out, it's the worst place to shop."
Food,2.0,OR,"Starbucks, Why are you here in business if you never have products for this community of patrons? This store is consistently out of products and it's very disappointing that management has no understanding of inventory. This store has improved some; the last three visits have been great and items made correctly but it's always a hit or miss with them. The Terry Parkway store rarely ever runs out of products and I absolutely adore Sandy at that store as she's the most personable employee of the two stores combined. Since my last visit here, I've opted to take my business to the Terry Parkway for good and now they're running into some of the same problems like this location."
Food,1.5,OR,"Beware! Robbery! I should have read the reviews before going! There is a reason the prices are not listed! I mean really, how much can custard soft serve really cost, right? Ha... for 2 waffle cones, 1 sundae and a small child cone it came to $27!!! I thought it was a mistake, but alas it was not. I was very upset. Most people in line were buying for their entire family and to take a financial hit like this for ICE CREAM is insane. I tried to enjoy the ""okay"" custard cone, but the insane cost lingered and I truly could not just enjoy the moment. Thanks for stealing my custard joy and my money! Please try another shop and save your money!"
Food,2.0,OR,I had to wait a long time for my drink while they stood around and talked to one another. There was only one young lady who was working to get hot drinks out and one working the cash register. The others were just walking around like they didn't have a care in the world. There were 6-7 workers behind the counter and 3 customers waiting on drinks. In an airport they need to pick up the pace! We have flights to catch and don't have time to wait on them to talk and then ask how to make the drinks. Train them so they know how to do the job. ThIs is a first for Starbucks....at least for me.....Buuttttt the drink was good! Lol
Food,4.0,OR,"this is my favorite coffee shop in town. looks fantastic inside and i love that the owner had his hands in actually building the decor himself. he also roasts the beans in house. baristas are sassy and friendly, although they could work out a better system for picking up orders, as it can get quite backed up here between classes when students are clamoring for their caffeine. decent prices, no stupid lingo for coffee sizes and unorthodox drinks, plus a good place to study. the outdoor seating is nice, too, and being that it's next to campus, always entertaining.
 i like the place so much that i feel bad saying i find their drip coffee a little too dark (yes, even their medium roast)."
Food,3.5,CG,"I stopped at the Starbucks on Chestnut St. in Nashville. There were about 4 employees. There was a line out the door and then the person who took our order was very nice. The employee was very nice. I got my usual iced chai tea. I also got the orange juice which was very good. It was also very good. I liked the drink I got and the atmosphere. It's very simple. The only downside is they have limited hours, which is why I was so excited to try this place."

I think the place is pretty cool. It's in an old warehouse in a strip mall. I think it's a good idea to go to a place with some cool stuff. I'd be more often to go to a local ice cream shop. This place has some really cool stuff.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite is the strawberry cake, but the carrot cake is also great! Their red velvet cake is also"
Food,4.0,CG,"I stopped by Local Harvest on a Saturday afternoon and it was a nice place to sit and eat. We had the opportunity to meet a couple of people, and the place was packed. We had a table and chairs in the back, and it was pretty cool to see people coming in with their dogs. The service was great and the place was clean and well kept. We also got a couple of drinks, and I highly recommend it to any customer.I always feel very welcome when I come to this Target. The employees are always friendly and helpful. I feel safe going here. There is a Starbucks and a pharmacy,"
Food,4.5,CG,"Soft opening in Rittenhouse- what a gem!  We decided to try a few beers and were blown away by the variety.  We liked all the choices, we got the dark chocolate and the oatmeal stout.  Both were amazing, they were very sweet and creamy.  The staff was very nice and the place was clean and very clean.  The place is a little small but will be back for sure!This is a great place to get some ice cream. I got the chocolate chunk and the vanilla bean. The ice cream was really good and I liked that the flavors were a little too sweet."
Food,4.5,CG,"I've been going to this location for the last two years.  

The first time I went, I had to get a bagel with cream cheese, and it was pretty bad.  I told the cashier I wanted a bagel with cream cheese and it was not ready and it had to be frozen.  I mentioned the last time it was frozen and she said she didn't want to make it.  I asked if she could make a sandwich and she said no.  I explained that I wanted cream cheese, and she said no.  I asked if she could make it and she said"
Food,4.5,CG,"The people in this shop are always nice and helpful. I will say that the bakery is pretty good. There's a lot of room for improvement in the design of the place, especially since it's a little smaller than the other shops. There are also some outdoor tables and benches for the workers to sit at. I've gotten a few items here and they are always so good. They have a great selection of fruit and veggies, and they have some great prices on certain items. They also have a great selection of baked goods. I've never been to a store where I didn't see a sale item that I didn"
Food,3.5,OR,"The 4 Stars is for this Holiday Meals! We picked up a Full Whole Turkey Meal for the family and it was delicious! The turkey was a really good size with plenty of left overs. Sides were all great: mashed potatoes, dressing and green beans. Gravy was great and so was the cranberry.

We ordered two types of rolls and both were delicious. The pecan pie is awesome! Probably one of the better store bought pies I've ever had.

All in all it was a great meal and easy to prepare. I will say pick up took awhile. We were there early and they said 15-20 mins but it was about 35-45 mins, so that was a little aggravating, but they were a nice and courteous staff."
Food,4.5,OR,"Beautiful patio shared with the taco joint next door.  Indoor seating is limited, so don't plan on coming w  Cursed bikes is a coffee shop and bicycle shop in one.  I'm not a biker, so I came for the food and drinks.  They have a selection of hot and iced coffees, several smoothies, and a case full of fresh pastries.  The specialty smoothie I ordered (peanut butter banana) was lacking on sweetness and was quite thin.  Maybe some of the other smoothies are thicker or sweeter, so give them a chance.

The turtle cookie (chocolate cookie with nuts and covered in caramel sauce) was amazing!  The blueberry muffin was covered in giant sugar crystals, was very moist, and light."
Food,4.5,OR,"Daughter and I trying different donut shops one a week to have some father and daughter time. Since we are going to philly you IKEA I went on yelp and found this local place in a south east neighborhood. We got there around 11am and the pickings were slim. You definitely have to get there early morning. We had a Boston creme a regular creme, cinnamon, cheese danish, and a glaze. All were very good and fresh and even though the  fillings were a little lite they were still more then Dunkin'. The owner was on premise and served us. She was super nice and enjoyable to talk to. Nice old family place for over 60 years and I would buy from them again."
Food,4.5,OR,"This tour was awesome. For $10 bucks they spend a good chunk of time walking you through their distilling process as well as a fun time doing tastings. 

The grounds aren't anything special, but you are walking through a distillery, so I personally wouldn't expect it to be fancy. The guide was really great, obviously knew her stuff about the whole process and knows the company and their strategy really well. 

I didn't love many of the ones we tasted, but she did teach us proper tasting technique and made it fun for everyone.

Tip: they don't mind if you grab a drink at the bar prior to the tasting, so definitely recommend doing that so you can have something to sip on along the way."
Food,4.0,OR,"Went last night for wine and wood fired pizza with a group of friends! It was my first time at this winery while it is a but of a drive it was worth it. I ended up getting the stony brook blush wine it was very good. Also you get to keep the wine glass which is a really cute marketing tool. 

I ordered the pizza Sangiovese it was delicious! It had mushrooms, sauce, mozzarella, and olive oil. It was crispy and perfectly cooked! 

They had live music which was a nice addition! The weather wasn't very good so we sat inside but it was just as lovely. Definitely a nice place to visit! Will definitely buy a bottle of wine next time I go."
Food,1.5,OR,"I made the mistake of going to this Walmart because I was in a rush and near campus. No carts, rude staff, dirty, ghetto, scary. I was literally scared the whole time I was there. I was followed out to my car by some wannabe rapper trying to sell me his mixtape. If you are a young girl, do not go here by yourself (or at all really). There were men hanging out in the parking lot (they actually set up lawn chairs) and they were making gross sexual comments to me while also asking for my money at the same time. This place is not safe. Terrible quality and I was definitely the unwanted minority there. Target is nearby and a thousand times better."
Food,3.5,CG,"Who doesn't like Costco? I go to the one on Virginia and it's close to the one on Virginia. 

If you don't want to have to drive to a mall, this is the place to go. 

I can't imagine going to Costco. The staff is always nice. And they have the most convenient parking. 

I think Costco has the best selection of items. And I love the fact that they have everything you need. I love their selection of items that you can't find anywhere else. I love that they have a parking lot in front of the store and walk out"

I had the banana split.  The banana split was pretty good, but I don't think it was worth the $6 for one.  I also had the peanut butter one and it was pretty good.  I also got the strawberry one and it was tasty.  I liked the strawberry one better.

I'm not sure what it was about this place, but it was a little too sweet for my liking, but I'm not sure what it was.  It was just a plain cupcake that"
Food,2.5,CG,This is the absolute worst Dunkin Donuts I've ever been to. The guy working the drive through window was very rude. The girl at the window was not nice at all and made it seem like she was in a hurry. The drive thru is very backed up. The staff is always extremely rude and very unprofessional. I'm not sure if it is due to the drive thru or just because the drive thru employees are all extremely rude and act like they are bothering you. The coffee is always made fresh and the staff are friendly. I'm not sure why the location is so close to where I live.
Food,4.5,CG,Tucson Hops Shop is another great place to go to. I will admit that I have been a frequent customer of the Publix grocery store since they opened and have had great sales and selections. They have everything from fresh sushi to fresh cheeses. This store is a great place to shop and a great place to shop!They are always busy but the staff is always so friendly. They make my drinks right! I love the atmosphere and the location. I always feel like I'm at a new home.Best ice cream I have ever had! They have so many flavors! My favorites are the wildberry lav
Food,4.0,CG,"We stumbled into this place on a whim after dinner in Nashville. The menu has a variety of flavors and toppings, including yogurt, toppings, and a lot of toppings. The toppings are all fresh and frozen and the topping selection is full of toppings. I ordered the waffle cone and it was delicious. I also got a scoop of the custard ice cream sandwich which was very good. It's very pricey for ice cream but I would definitely recommend the waffle cone. The store was clean and the staff was friendly."

But here goes; So made a Starbucks run and came in here with my 2 friends for 7 drinks. 4 hot lattes and a hot chocolate. They didn't want to give me sleeves for my hot drinks cuz they were running low and wanted to reserve them for ""really hot drinks"". I told her we did have hot drinks but she said they really aren't and really hot drinks are like Americano's  I mean really? I've never experienced this and don't think we really need to be ordering $5 lattes and have a cheap Starbucks be stingy with sleeves. Kinda ridiculous for a company that makes millions.  On brother..."
Food,4.5,OR,"I just happened to be walking by 
Ordered a cappuccino
The girl was nice, the cappuccino was so small
She didn't ask me what size. 
Place was filled with hipsters staring at me. 
I'm from out of town, Las Vegas, I guess I wasn't boring enough looking for them. 
The place was kind of cute
The cage sign design was inviting well done with the marketing but the inside was bland, simple. 
If I lived in the area I doubt I'd ever go back in. 

Not a fan of hipster places, I'd have appreciated and expect up sells. 
I think every owner or manager should train their staff to upgrade drinks and add on snacks or sandwiches. 

The place isn't terrible. 
I didn't sweeten my cappuccino enough. 
My fault."

This store also has noteworthy, honest, management and employees.  I accidentally left my wallet at the pizza counter (""Kevin"") and didn't realize it until I got home, called and was relieved after manager (""Heidi"") had tracked it down and it was waiting for me at the customer service section (""Murphy"").  ""Kevin"" at the pizza counter had been holding it for me, so that no one else got their hands on it.  I was so relieved (I mean, we keep ""everything"" in our wallets!).  My sincere thanks to Kevin, Heidi, and to Murphy - you are great!

Food,4.0,OR,"The customer service can very much so make or break a business. I was excited to see a Vino here in Nevada, since our local CA location closed last year. One of the owners, Karen, greeted me right away and was very helpful and friendly. She had great options available in the tasting flights (all reds for me), and I walked away with a bottle of Pinot Noir. If I lived in Reno I could certainly see this being a go to spot with a book and glass of wine on frequent occasion!

There are several varieties available on the wall for purchase, and at least 10 available for tasting. I didn't take the opportunity to grab a snack here, but will do so next time around!"
Food,4.5,CG,Today was the first time that I had ever had a gelato from this place. I ordered the Strawberry gelato and it was delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and the gelato was amazing. I will definitely be back. I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was a bit disappointed because I had to wait on them for about 30 minutes. I was quite surprised to see that there was only one girl working and that I was not greeted. I understand that it is a busy day but I felt the need to wait a bit longer. There were only two people working.

The only thing I didn't like about this location was that it was very busy. There was no one behind us. I was hoping to see them make the drinks and bring them out to us. They didn't seem to care. Maybe they just need to get some work done. I think I would like to see more seating. The only positive thing I would suggest is that there are more outlets inside and out, but maybe it would be"

We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view. The only negative was that we were not greeted by the bartender. We also ordered the chicken wings and it was so bad we could not eat it. I highly recommend it to any customer. We will be back. We had a great time on a Sunday afternoon. I loved the wine, the vibe, the people and the food."
Food,4.0,CG,"This is genius.  In fact, I thought it was a great place for a variety of cupcakes.  The woman at the counter was very friendly, and offered to take my order to the customer.  It was a beautiful day, and I would definitely come back.

They had a lot of unique flavors to choose from, and I loved the cake icing.  I will say that I had to pick a few items that they didn't have that day, so I went with a couple of my favorites, and they were all very good.  I was able to choose a few of them, and I ended"

I will definitely be ordering from them again!We stopped in for a few beers and had a great time! Great people, great place to hang out and have a glass of wine with friends! We also got a couple of great questions about the beer and the winery. I like that they have a separate tasting room for your tasting which is nice. Will definitely be back!This is a great little local spot."
Food,4.5,OR,"This was a much needed addition to the Carmel coffee shop scene and has beautifully became a hustling and bustling spot for meetings, remote workers and families. I've visited multiple time and this past weekend enjoyed a spot on their shaded patio to crank out some work for a couple of hours. I typically opt for their seasonal creations and they never seem to disappoint. This round I tried the peanut butter jelly latte which surprisingly was not too sweet. A few notes:
-great natural light in the space
-walking distance from the main downtown street of Carmel and the Monon Trail
-plenty of outlets for remote work
-a few baked good treats are available
-they roast their own beans
-rumor has it their cold brew is quite delightful (next time, next time."
Food,4.0,OR,"Despite passing this quaint place daily,  it took being wooed in for a chat with a coworker to finally stop in. Needless to say, my stop quickly turned into a treat-fest! While waiting for my friend, I chatted with the barista about local drinks and pastries. After debating between a Thai tea and mint-vanilla limeade, I was offered a sample of the latter and couldn't get enough of the mix of flavors! She suggested I get my sweet cream fix with a salted caramel popsickle. That's right- coffee addict walks into a coffee shop and ends up getting a limeade and popsickle? Absolutely worth it. My friend gulped down her fresh doughnut and Thai tea so quickly that she couldn't even  get a word in."
Food,3.0,OR,"I love this Starbucks. It's my favorite because they mix the toppings into the oatmeal for me, so I can eat it if I'm driving without having to prepare. The employees are all so nice and efficient. The only drawback of this one is that the drive-thru is terrible. They can't make up their minds how they want the drive in to work. Sometimes they block an entrance and want you to drive around the building, and sometimes it's okay if you come in through the entrance. It leads to confusion when there are a lot of cars. Additionally, the traffic in the drive-thru tends to block traffic during the 8:30-10 AM rush. That's okay, though. When things get too hectic I just park and run inside."
Food,4.5,OR,"What can you say, its ice cream damn it!  It's a town favorite with all kinds of yummy flavors that has a feel of the old days when you'd be served your favorite ice cream by a local family.  Usually all of the local high school kids work there for the summer and I have to say that they're always enthusiastic and have a smile on their faces (oh yeah, they're working with ice cream all day).  Anyway, i like to stop here on a boiling hot summer day to cool myself off with a water ice.  At night, that's when I go for the ice cream which I still can't pick a favorite but I'm working my way up the flavor ladder."
Food,4.0,OR,"This is my neighborhood grocery store that I frequently come to. It is conveniently located on my way home from work so it makes it for easy to pick up a few items or do a big grocery run. I find that the store carries a nice variety of items whether it is organic, ethnic, bulk, produce or locally sourced items and for reasonable prices. The store is fairly clean. Right now there are renovations happening to expand the store so there is a little more disorganization than normal but the staff are very helpful showing where to find where the products are now located. I am always left with a smile from the store greeter wishing me a good night which is a nice personal touch."
Food,4.5,OR,"They finally have a store front!!

Delicious is an understatement. Crust Vegan Bakery has the best fresh pastries and baked goods. Back in May (4 months ago) we had an opportunity to try their cinnamon buns and cosmic brownies and ever since then we have been hooked. Last weekend when we heard they were opening a store front down the street from our house we marked off our calendars and counted down the days! 

Their new store front is in a perfect location near the heart of Main Street Manayunk. Currently no seating and yesterday they sold out of all baked goods during their soft opening so be sure to go early! 

My new personal favorite is the strawberry rhubarb pie! Light, not too sweet, absolutely amazing."
Food,4.5,CG,"Mmm... Avocado shakes? Strawberry Boba? Pineapple Boba? Taro? Strawberry Boba? Pineapple Boba?  The list goes on and on... Taro bun?  You can go on and on.  

I can't imagine I will ever find a place that offers a higher quality product.  I will stick with my usual smoothie and smoothie.  I just can't get over how much it is.  I don't know if I'm going to have to get my smoothie every day, but I'm not.  I just can't get over how much it"

Food,3.0,CG,"I'm so lucky to live close to the market and try out all the flavors. I love the variety of flavors and the prices are a bit high but the quality of the product is worth it. They have a few flavors of water ice that you can choose from and some you can add with your ice cream. They also have some other non dairy flavors too. I haven't had anything but good experiences here. I'm a fan of the fact that they have a drive thru so if you want to get your ice cream, they have a drive thru which is convenient. They have a big variety of flavors and the employees are always friendly"
Food,4.5,CG,"I'm torn about my feelings about this place. It's a little on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it. I also get the Taro milk tea, which is pretty good. It's not too sweet, and it's not too sweet. I also like the jelly boba. I also like the fact that the place is a little pricier than most other bubble tea places, but I think that's a good thing. This is a great place for a quick snack for a coffee, but I've never been able to find a seat in a place with such a long line."
Food,4.5,CG,Oh that sweet smell of fresh airy goodness!  I saw a lot of people eating the pastries and we had to get a table to get the seat ourselves.

It's like a perfect stop for a sweet treat. I got the vanilla custard. It's creamy and not too sweet. I had a scoop of it and it was good."
Food,4.0,OR,"I cannot possibly put into writing how happy I am to have just moved into the same neighborhood as this grocery store. A few highlights that I noticed on my few ""hot laps"" around the store (I actually wasn't in there to buy anything, just to gawk at the awesome food. I know, awesome, right?) were the bulk coffee (in barrels!), bulk snack items, nice big wine selection, a wall of beer, and some good looking organic food! I can't wait to come back and actually buy groceries instead of just standing in the middle of the store with my arms open wide, spinning slowly in circles and feeling like I'm standing in a candy store. Well, that didn't actually happen, but it sure felt like it."
Food,4.5,OR,"Wineries in Reno/Sparks?? Yes please!!

Engine 8 is a breath of fresh air in a renovated and quickly growing area of Sparks that I am so excited to revisit. It is located right next door to the re-opened movie theater, making it a wonderful stop before and/or after an afternoon flick. 

We've done their flights a few times and end up finding something new to love each time. They have a good selection of sweeter, fruiter wines... however, a dry red fiend like myself can still put together a nice tasting either way. Their Merlot and Pinot Noir are super tasty, and the staff has always been really helpful in pointing us in the right direction. The comfy patio doesn't hurt either!

Cheers to urban wineries in the Reno/Sparks area!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Service has taken a backseat, and standards have fallen. This once shining example of Starbucks franchise consistency has been pulled down by new hires who are difficult to understand (in person as well as on the intercom), and who appear to give no effort to customer service.

I can tolerate a decent amount of shenanigans but my experience this morning was so abysmal that I have to cry foul. Not only was the window attendant impossible to understand because of a lack of enunciation but he ""no look"" passed me my coffee and spilled it on my hand. Then he didn't  notice what he had done because he instantly turned his back on me. I would expect this from a Duncan Donuts or McDonald's, but not a Starbucks."

The bartenders are friendly and helpful.....the beers are scrumptious...I had a porter and a german wheat....hubby had Goal-den-Ale and and English Bitter and we ordered some tasty warm pretzel sticks with cream cheese and chives.....Very wonderful....This is a spacious place with plenty of nooks and crannies to have your own little party if you have a small crowd.  There are dart boards and a large sized Jenga game and a hilarious Steer Head on the wall with a washer attached to a string and you have to try to get the washer on the horn.....I was not successful today...but I will be back....
Food,4.5,OR,"I don't know which I love most about this store. Maybe the quality of the fresh cut meat, the freshness of the deli items, the great prices and variety- but I actually think the best quality of the store is the friendliness and high level of customer service that all of their employees show. It even starts in the parking lot where if someone is moving carts they will greet you and offer you a cart before you even get in the door. Everyone is pleasant doesn't hesitate to help and it's a pleasure to shop here. I travel a distance to go there but yet somehow it's never a chore. Really glad someone recommended this store to me and we will shop here for a long time."
Food,2.0,OR,"Not only did the pharmacy fast track the meds for follow up on my daughters wisdom tooth extraction. They were so fun and caring when she insisted on speaking to them when we were dropping them off. They were ready well before I was told they would be. When I returned to pick them up they remembered who I was, asked if my daughter was doing ok and the pharmacist offered some advice on keeping her comfortable. To me this is true customer service. I grew up in a family business and my parents always told me hat the best advertisement for a business is word of mouth... I won't stop raving about the service at this Walgreens. Thank y'all for making this experience a little less stressful."
Food,4.5,CG,"We were not impressed with the flavors, the ice cream was cold and the toppings were just ok.

I go here to get my groceries and they have a great selection. I love their seafood and seafood selection. I love their chicken salad! I will go back to the grocery store on occasion to check out the cheeses. This is the best beer store in the area. I have a hard time finding anything that I like here. It's the perfect place to get a beer for a dinner party. Their beer is great, and the staff is always friendly."

I told her that I wanted a shot and she told me to wait. I was also told that they could have it in the back by the pharmacist. I was so excited to see a new pharmacist!

Food,4.5,OR,"So yummy and so many flavors to choose from! It's obvious that they use fresh ingredients here and I liked that the flavors they offer aren't just the average options you come across (think lavender honey, brown sugar banana, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and several vegan options). 

My favorite was the passion fruit ice cream (which was actually vegan!) because it was tart and refreshing. The flavor was so good that I didn't care that the ice cream itself was not super smooth in consistency. I also got the peanut butter candy (think homemade Reese's in vanilla ice cream, mmmmm!) and the brown sugar banana (fresh banana flavor bursting through!).  

I liked everything we tried and would come back again and maybe even try a taco from the neighbors!"
Food,4.5,OR,"We go to the Butcher Block quiet a bit. In fact, several times we've gotten out meat for the week there instead of the grocery store. The only issue we've ever had is having to wait for an order (covid19 wait times aside, that's justified). I'll call 3 or 4 hours in advance but when I get there,  it's rarely ready.  it's frustrating, but obviously not the end of the world since I keep going back. I think they just have more business than they can keep up with honestly. One time I ordered a roast that was not great quality, but they replaced it with a bigger one for free.

Our favorite things to get are their brats and NY strip steaks. they're definitely worth trying out!!"
Food,4.0,OR,"VISIT THE BAKED BEAR!! You have to give the opportunity for the sweet tooth in you to try an ice cream sandwich from here. The brownie, cookie, or the goeey butter cake for the sandwich component is awesome. They are all super soft and make for a great addition when your spoon is full of all the different layers of the sandwich. The blueberry brittle ice cream was a great ice cream to pick, full of flavor and when will with the brownie. Then the brownie pieces that were added in the sandwich were also amazing. They were the perfect size to chew on and to have ice cream hold to. Get a big scoop of all the layers of the ice cream sandwich and you will love it."
Food,3.0,OR,"There's a 50/50 chance that you will end up with the wrong order going through the drive thru. Take it from someone who goes to Starbucks almost daily, this location is horrible. The drive thru takes FOREVER and then they rush you through just handing you a random drink that's not yours. I've kept track, and they are currently sitting at a 50% accuracy. They under fill every drink and someone's they taste horrible. I avoid this location and only go if I'm shopping near by. Save yourself some trouble and just go to McDonald's down the parking lot and get cheaper coffee that's made correctly. Corporate needs to be on this location NOW. They are starting to lose valuable customers because of the customer service and wait times."
Food,4.0,OR,"The proximity of this coffee place to a class I attend 3X a week is a danger to my budget. But, alas, this grad student need her coffee. This review is based on only one visit to Luce, but damn one visit was good enough for me. I will definitely return to this place! I had a delicious mocha. The espresso had a nice bite- not too weak nor strong.Nice level of roast overall. It could have had a better chocolate taste though but definitely not a big deal.  I was bummed that when I went, there was no place to sit so I had to take my drink ""to-go."" Oh well. I'll try to ""check-in"" next time I go when I try some of their other drinks."
Food,4.5,OR,"Really depends on what location you visit. We live about a mile away from one and two miles from another and it's almost like they are completely different companies... Not that a mile difference is big for us to just go a little out of the way, but it might be for somebody- and it's too bad it appears the two locations aren't run with the same standards. Not the best value,  although they do have some decent BOGO deals from time to time. Really wish they did a regular gas rewards program, if they did we would make Publix our market for larger shopping lists... For the time being,  it's good for smaller trips and last-minute trips. On the upside,  their produce is consistently good."

The ice cream is the best, the service is great, and the staff is always willing to help you find what you are looking for. If you have a craving for a sweet treat, I highly recommend stopping by here and checking it out!I love this place. It's right next to the train station. It's like a perfect stop for a sweet treat.

The staff is always friendly and the drinks are always delicious. 

I think the place is pretty small, but it's not too bad. 

I would come back to this location for the food. 

One thing I don't like about this place is the lack of seating. It is quite small and I think there's more seating than the one at the other end of the store. I would probably recommend going to the one in the same shopping plaza, or just walking over and checking out if you're in the area. "

I am very happy I found this place and the service was excellent. I ordered a regular vanilla latte and a latte. The coffee was great and the coffee was good. I love the fact that they have the option of non-dairy options. I wish I could get one here every time I'm in the area.

Food,4.5,CG,"In town visiting my folks, and I thought it was a great place to go for a cup of coffee. I had the banana, egg and cheese, and the avocado toast. The avocado toast was a little bland, but I think they were busy. I also noticed the avocado toast was slightly more than sweet. I think it was a good thing the avocado toast was so light and airy. It had a good flavor, but not overwhelming. I'd definitely go back for some coffee if I were in the area.I have been going to this store for a long time.  It has always been clean and the employees are very helpful."
Food,4.0,OR,I am SO happy that they opened a Total Wine in Brandon right by where I live. This is the go to place for not only wine but I like to get my Rekordlig from here too! I love all the different options to choose from and I love the different wine tastings available. Being able to come into a one stop shop location where I can also taste different varieties is amazing! I used to drive all the way to the location on Dale Mabry just to enjoy all that this store has to offer. This is perfectly located in Brandon and everyone that I have encountered that works here has been extremely nice! I enjoy coming here and always like to try something new that they offer here.
Food,2.0,OR,"Like another reviewer said, ""it's Walmart,"" having said that, they still are maintaining their unfavorable reputation due to their employees. Today they had a ""watch type person"" stationed at the entrance to the garden center instead of a cashier where there is a designated spot. I asked him what/where was the cashier? He said inside with an inference that I should know. I went inside to find 11 people inline to be helped by one cashier when there are 2 registers. I asked the same watchdog about getting some help as the cashier seemed oblivious to the line and this person looked at the line then at me and acted like he needed to hurry back to his stool! 
Same story, same attitude, no customer service skills needed to apply."
Food,2.5,OR,"This is a chill spot away from the busy hustle of broadway downtown. 

During the day a coffee break kinda day. Night time entrance in the back attached a pink house is the night scene. Cocktail drinks about average to higher end price. Full bar with signature drinks. 
Street parking. 
Web sites says they are strict about dress codes no flip flops or sandals. Other reviews said they had problem getting in with open toes shoes. But I didn't have any issues with open toes or maybe it was just the males. Not sure. But the vibes felt more casual then cocktail dress kinda lounge. 
Phone only permitted outside deck only. Yeah... not sure how that would go about. Regardless of the rule you will find someone on their cells."
Food,4.5,OR,"I admit to being a coffee snob. I make good coffee at home and if I'm gonna spend $5.00 I want it to be OMG, like Chestnut hill coffee or Uncle Bobbies. White horse is sweet and filled w young folks on their computers but it isn't a place for good coffee. I ordered a dry cappuccino. It came in a nice mug, but an amateur pull. Way too hot to drink which means the coffee, and my tongue, get burned. Nothing that can't be addressed if the staff really gets into their brew and how to do it. Tried the egg and sausage flatbread. That was tasty though the pita doesn't stand up well to microwaving and gets dry.  Sweet place to hang, not a coffee destination IMO."
Food,4.5,OR,"I give 4 stars for their mixology, hospitality, and philanthropy. I attended a launch party for Gentleman's Mustard on Monday, a day that West Fork is typically closed. (Hospitality). I decided to try a Silent D cocktail and skip the straight spirit tasting approach. It was a great choice. House bourbon with apple cider and a few fancy bartender words mixed in. (Mixology)

The owner added praise to their Manhattan, (pictured), first one I've ever had so I can't compare. It was very nice, but different than what I like. Lastly, (Philanthropy) Whiskey Fork didn't charge Gentleman's Mustard a rental fee for the night and a portion of the bar proceeds went to the launch party's charity, The Katalis Foundation."
Food,3.5,OR,"Literally stopped in for some aspirin for a headache on our way to the beach and ended up staying a little longer than planned! It's amazing how going to target without your kids allows you to wander, explore and actually LOOK at things! 

I love how this is a Super Target. meaning full regular Target and full grocery too. Makes me miss having a full grocery side, as my local store in Texas is a small ""regular"" one. We of course ended up with way more than just aspirin. grabbed some snacks for the hotel, a few items to bring home for the kiddos and I'm sure a few other unnecessary items. Can you leave here without spending over $20?? 

Store was clean, organized and well stocked. Employees were friendly."
Food,4.5,OR,"Can't believe it took us so long to get here. Was trying to find somewhere to get a few quality brews in the neighborhood on a Friday night and our usual haunts weren't really doing anything we were feeling. Came across Dissent and remembered we'd been meaning to check it out. Fits the profile of many smaller breweries in the neighborhood with a small bar, high top tables and a nice lounge area. Grabbed a few flights. Was a BIG FAN of the barrel aged cream ale as well as the Pumpkin Spice Berliner.  Seemed to be some local regulars there who were friendly and chatty. Big plus that they offer not only growler fills but also single can fills as well. We will be back again for sure."
Food,4.5,CG,I just had to add that it was the best part of our trip! The best part about the tour was the unique and interesting beers. The tour guide was great and the beer was great. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey. I wish I could have brought my own food though. I was also the only person in the tasting room and I felt like I was being a bit kid. I felt like I was an adult but I didn't feel like I was being kid. I would definitely recommend the tour.I've never been to a Dunkin Donuts before and I've been to a lot of other locations in the area
Food,4.0,CG,"One of our favorite spots in SB!  Great ambiance, friendly staff, and a great patio.  Great drinks and food, both in and out.  Will definitely be back!The customer service is excellent.  I am from Seattle and I come to Starbucks often.  I always get a great drink, the most consistent, and the best customer service I've had in a long time.  The store is always clean and they have everything I need.  I'm not sure if I'll be back, but I will.  They also have a great selection of other beverage/food items.  I love their customer service. "

The shop is huge and clean. There's also a huge selection of donuts to choose from, including glazed and maple glazed. I also love the cute little counter with the best prices and fresh flowers. I've always gotten a dozen or so donuts here, and I've never had a bad experience here. 

I usually go for the donuts but today I went for the donuts"
Food,1.5,CG,Why do I keep coming back? The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star is because the two employees that worked there were extremely rude and seemed annoyed that I was there. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were busy but I don't know how many people were working. I was also the only person in the store and they were out of items. I didn't see any of the employees there and the two employees I came in with were not wearing masks. I feel like they were the only ones around. I'm not sure why they just didn't seem to care and maybe they just didn't care.

If you haven't tried their ice cream yet, you must try it. I have a hard time deciding on what to get, so I'm going to have to try the mint chocolate chip, mint chocolate chip, and the cherry and chocolate."

I test to see if the checker will even say one word to me.  The other day, my total came up and she wouldn't even say it.  I just looked at her.  She went into death-stare mode with me, continuing to refuse to say a word.  I finally caved in the stare-off and just swiped my card.  She threw down my bag and I walked defeated from the counter.  Now, in defense, there is one lady there who is a doll baby, but I rarely see her.  Stock, price and parking is as with every Walgreens...very good."

The Macarons are on the smaller side but they're not too chewy and so delicious. I also love their dried mango slices to snack on, and they're not too sweet. They have a wide variety of pasta choices and I love their Pappardelle pasta, the very wide thick noodles. Their vodka and basil marinara is delicious and only costs $2-3.50. Their sweet potato gnocchi with butter is really good too, not too flavorless and not too overpowering. I love Trader Joe's and highly recommend this one. The workers and cashiers r so nice too!"
Food,4.5,OR,"A couple of weeks ago my husband and I stumbled into the New Day Meadery Tasting Room.  The owners, Tia and Bret, were extremely gracious and enthusiastically showed us around their not-yet-open wine tasting room.  We were excited by the beautiful space and enjoyed meeting this lovely couple, so we made a mental note to go back when they were open.

It's open for real now, so we checked it out as we were strolling through Fountain Square's first Friday.  Very, very nice - for $5 you can get a full flight (8 different tastes of their honey wine) and for $1 you can get a single taste.  At some point in the future they will also offer snacks to go with their tastings.

Another hit for Fountain Square!"

Well the girl entered my insurance info in and told me its a Rx discount card,,umm no its not. They told me my medicine was going to be 200.00 I laughed and said you are putting the info wrong and got my script and left. Called Cigna to let them know what was going on and they said my medication is covered and would be 25-50 dollars.

Food,4.0,OR,"This was my third visit always ordering a beer or two and being on my way. Tonight I went hoping to try the tacos I have heard are so good. It was not overly crowded, plenty of space so I ordered my friend and I a beer. My friend asked about tacos and the bartender lectured us very rudely that ""the sign stated, no tacos tonight"". It was in a very disrespectful tone. (Hopefully he is just having a bad night). Which is understandable, but being treated in that rudely of a manor made me want to leave immediately and spend my dollars at a business that treated customers with more respect. Very disappointing experience. The beer selection also was poor but I was okay with that for the fun atmosphere."

kouign Amann is the best thing I have tried in a while. The plain KOUIGN AMANN is like a sweet flaky croissant with a sugary crusted exterior priced around $4. 50. The flavored KOUIGN AMANN are twice as better because they have the same flaky sugary crust but are filled with cream in the middle priced around $5 ish. The crème flavors vary on the day. My favorite is kouign amann is filled with guava cream. They have a ton of other pastries croissants, danish, cookies etc. The bakery itself looks like a classy boutique. It is warm and inviting.

The selection of cakes was huge and every one of them looked amazing. We ultimately chose the tiramisu cake for a dinner party and it did not disappoint. Everyone loved it! So flavorful and creamy. They also had a large variety of individual serving desserts on the counter like baklava, which we bought a few pieces of and ate right there in the store. So delicious. I will definitely be buying all of my cakes there from now on and I can't wait to have them do my 3 kids' birthday cakes this year. I'm so happy we tried this bakery and we will definitely be regular customers."
Food,5.0,OR,"Hands down, I think Wood Fire Roasted Coffee is one of the best roasters in Reno. Full disclosure, I've been using Tim's coffee at Dish Cafe for 12 years.  Every few years we evaluate the other possibities in town, have tastings and give our customers other options to try out and Tim always wins.

His coffee is full bodied without being over roasted and doesn't have the over roasted bitter flavor of Starbucks.  I can attest to the fact that on a daily basis we get complements on our coffee, not once a week or every few days, but every day someone will mention the how great the coffee is.

Coffee like food is a very personal thing and everyone has different tastes, but I would wholeheartely recommend you try his coffee."

I've always had such nice experiences with the people there when buying my gas, this was the first time I've had to use them for more than gas and I highly recommend them!! I still have not actually used them for car repair work but when I need it they will be my first call.

I was debating between the cinnamon sugar and the regular salted soft pretzel but since I knew I'd be having plenty of sweets later (Bassett's Ice Cream & 4th Street Cookies) I opted for the standard pretzel.

Nice big chunks of salt (not the teeny tiny ones that you can barely taste) and super soft pretzel on the inside of the skin that had just enough snap to it. Hands down THE best soft pretzel I've ever had. You just GOTTA try them if you're a pretzel lover!"

Im not really into beer but that had an amazing seltzer on tap that they recommend. Riot water? Anyways, By far the best brewery we went to this weekend!

Besides the performance of the Pels I was happy with my experience here. Smoothie King is located to the southwest-ish of the Superdome. Our seats were good and affordable. We sat in section 121 for about $60 a ticket. 

Again, the on court performance left me wishing for more but everything else was top notch for a NBA game. The halftime performance was awesome. They had a dance theme that counted down the top songs of the year. The in-game entertainment was well organized and kept the crowd involved. They had t-shirt tosses, calendar giveaways, and it was Jrue Holiday bobblehead night.

They do not allow selfie sticks here. We had to stash it outside in a dark place behind a bush."

The store itself has air-conditioning, is well set up, and easy to shop. Has a sort of Boutique feel and is definitely cleaner and more inviting than some of the other tourist shops you'll find in the area.

The cashier welcomed us in and offered us the free samples as soon as we walked in the door. The friends we were with opted to buy a few souvenirs here in a couple of their candy boxes to take home to friends.

First thing we were asked was ""you're not from around here"" and when we said no the person looked at us with disdain/disgust like what are you even doing here. Choose to take out purchase back to hotel instead of eating there.  It was a 10 minute ride in an air conditioned vehicle and by the time we got to the hotel our purchase was half melted.  Either made incorrectly or they need to invest in better cups to hold their product. May try a 2nd time when we come back to visit to see if it was just a bad day but definitely won't be recommending to anyone else."

They make excellent veggie chips and they sell King Cake, which my other colleague somehow managed to buy 7 of and walk the 0.3 mi distance back to the hotel.

They remind me of a Whole Foods with their awesome selection of bulk bin items, many of which were prepackaged if you prefer. They also had a section of sushi, alcohol, and prepared foods, although I wish their prepared food section was a little larger. 

My colleague noted they had Blue Bell ice cream, which I guess is a local thing. If I had been a few days longer, I would have considered trying it."

I even tried refilling prescriptions the day before and promised it'll be ready the next day and when I arrived at drive thru it wasn't filled and asked to come back a couple of hours. I know that places get busy but never had problems anywhere else. If CVS didn't buy out other pharmacy I wouldn't even consider them especially with this kind of service. It is now 30 minutes and still nothing. If I didn't need my meds badly I would've hung up already."
Food,2.0,OR,"They need to hire more people. Aisles are long and there's nobody there to ask in case you have a question. Prices are extremely high (sometimes it is cheaper to buy organic food in other places rather than the conventional food from ACME). Stupidly long lines because they don't barely pay any personnel to work as cashiers, (even when they have the space and facilities) since they try to force you to use the ""auto-pay"" or whatever that automatic system is called, which is absolutely helpless for seniors and actually doesn't really work properly, failing with every other customer. 

Unlikely some people said before, workers have always been nice to me, I guess people get moody and burnout when they work in a bad place, but that's not her fault, but the company's."
Food,3.0,CG,I stopped by this Walgreens location on the way home from work. There were about three employees. There was one in front of me and she seemed annoyed that I was there. She was rude and rude. I was told that I had to wait for the pharmacist to come over to the front desk to see if I had to wait on the line. She told me she would have to wait on the line for two hours because it was so much longer. I told her I had to wait on line for 15 minutes and she said that she was the one that was there and she would have to wait on it.
Food,4.0,CG,"Last time at Publix I had to wait an additional 15 minutes in line for a deli and the other two employees had to move up to the register to help them.

Food,4.5,OR,"Love this new addition to the grocery repertoire downtown. The store is HUGE. It's what you'd expect of a Whole Foods: flowers, beautiful produce, priced accordingly; fresh fish and meats, items you can take home and cook; a big ready-to-go bar, a pizza bar, really nice items in the ready made deli section, tons of soups; lots of grab and go stuff. The macaron bar is hard to resist, as well as the cookies / sweets by the pound thing. They have a cafe/ coffee shop inside, walk up order for sandwiches, in addition to all your usual grocery store suspects. They have a huge variety of hummus flavors that I plan to work my way through. I can also recommend the Marcona almonds and the olive bar. Nice wines and cheeses for parties."
Food,2.5,OR,"The store has good stuff, but the pharmacy is terrible!
I gave my prescription and told them to give me brand name only. When I come to pick it up I have generic prescription. I tell them i only want brand so they slowly go to change. After 10minutes they tell me to wait but I come back next day to pick up. I pick up and it's not in a normal white paper bag. It's in a brown paper bag that you would use for lunch! I come home and notice one medication that I need to take for 3 month is already expiring these month! So I bought an expired drug. There no way I'm going there again, there rite aid across the street and there no way there worer than this crap!"

The staff is friendly and helpful. It has a great selection of vitamins and herbal things. For those conscious of their health, they have fresh produce and organic produce as well. The meat and seafood sections have many choices but not a lot to choose from. I have a chance to visit their stores at many locations and every time our shopping experience was wonderful. The prices are a bit high.  Be alerted to fetch good discounts on many items particularly on shrimps offered periodically. Items on sale go quickly with no more expected soon. I highly recommend visiting this store for convenient and clean shopping."

My children especially love their baked goods, we love their burgers and fries and we love their pizza. Today I decided to try their breakfast hot bar. I was not impressed at all! In an effort to stay away from bread I got Turkey sausage and bacon and a few of the breakfast potatoes. The meats were ok but the potatoes did not sit well with me. They were big and still pretty hard (not cooked long enough). Again, so far this is my first bad experience with the hot food here so that's why I still gave them a 4 overall"
Food,4.5,OR,"I went here looking for a special beer as a gift to someone who had helped us.  I use specific loosely, because I had no idea what I was getting.  I just needed their opinion of a good beer for a man they'd never met.  Two of the gentleman took their time discussing and try to get a better understanding of the tastes my friend may enjoy.  Then, the one walked back and grabbed our final decision for you.  I had to pick up some other things while there - ice and the like...and once all was said and done, one of the gentleman carried my purchases out for me and put them in my car.  Clean place of business.  Relaxing atmosphere.  Good stuff all around."

The place itself is very small, but the taproom is very spacious and has a very nice modern feel. The beer menu is pretty good. The food menu is good, and the service was very friendly. The only downside was that the place was empty, which is a big plus. The beers were okay, but the place was not very busy."

I had an iced coffee and a cold brew with oat milk. The coffee was fine. The oat milk was not the best, but it was pretty good. The oat milk was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend had a hot coffee with oat milk. He liked it, but I'm not sure if it was a strong coffee flavor. I just didn't care for it.

I have visited this CVS Pharmacy twice and have had a bad experience both times. The first time I was in, the pharmacist had no idea what to do, and it was extremely unprofessional to say the least. 

The second time I was in, the pharmacist had to speak to me twice. I was quite surprised to see that there was no one in the pharmacy at all, so I went to CVS across the street to see if I could find a CVS that had just been out of stock of prescription medication. I asked if they had it in stock,"
Food,4.5,CG,"If you are not close to an open space, you need to go to the bar upstairs. The bar upstairs is very open and bright. I think the drinks were pretty good. They had a few flavors to try, but I opted for the ""Cumberjack"" with boba. It was a bit too sweet for me, but it was a tasty beverage. I liked the milk tea with boba. The strawberry drink was smooth and refreshing. I think I would come back here again for a drink. The staff were nice and helpful. I would definitely come back.

I finally got to try them yesterday - a truly delightful addition to the coffee scene in Nashville,  in my opinion. They change up the menu seasonally, so the Turkish Hazelnut Latte I originally planned to get was turned into the Cardamom-Rose Latte. We also tried the Sweet Whiskey Caramel Latte. The pastry selection looks like it might be decent, but there wasn't too much left by the time we got there. We did try the Whiskey Apple Hand Pie and the Fruit Tart  - both of which were delicious! They have a pretty extensive drink menu, both caffeinated and not, iced and hot. I look forward to trying more drinks from them!"

I was just in there and she yelled at the cashier in front of me because I asked her to put names on the cups since I had a large order. I was informed by the store manager that they no longer wrote on the cups. I explained I had a large order and needed to know who each drink belonged to. She again refused to put names on the cups. After drinks were made, I realized the drink were wrong and the manger almost refused to remake them because it was my fault I had messed up the orders by wanting the names on them."
Food,4.0,OR,"I tell you right up front, I don't drink much so take that for what it is worth. 

I really, really like the ""Surrealist"" beer. It smelled so good too. It smelled like a green tea I like. Maybe I like tea so much, that I like beer flavored tea? 

Ok so put all that aside, the atmosphere is so cool. Every little design element was carefully crafted or acquired and displayed with purpose. The space is nice and open. The bar big enough to walk right up to the bartender. My service was very fast on a busy Friday night. 

The outdoor patio is super fun to chill. Nice grass for some recreational activities and listening to some pretty cool jam bands. 

The root beer was really good too! See...not a drinker at heart..."

Items change weekly and sometimes they have REALLY good sales. Just this week ,I picked up buy 2 get 1 free cases of Pepsi which is good deal because they cost about $7 in Philly with our beverage tax. Good produce selection, frozen section and gourmet snacks. Their meat section is pretty small and very overpriced for what's offered. I rarely buy any meat from here. Just keep an eye on the expiration dates with your canned, jarred or boxed goods. Sales ads run from Tuesday to Monday I believe.  If you see a good deal, get it. It's most likely not to be there when you come back."

Butter Cake is more dense, moist and uber sweet for those of us who love a mouth full of Domino delight. Heat it up and it becomes sweet butter soup.
The large cookie, brownie, cannoli trays looked great, but will await another day.

Grabbed a seat at the bar, and the bartenders were quick, friendly and did a great job. The food truck that they had that night had wrapped up a little early which was a bit of a bummer, but I grabbed a soft pretzel app that they prepped behind the bar. It was good, no complaints. Beers were all good - the Sedition Saison and the Eraserhood were my two faves. I snagged a mixed six pack of cans - two Lager, two Unity and two Wheat, and then two crowlers for a party. Good crowd, great locale, I will be back for sure. Thanks for a great time."

They've got a good amount of socially distanced seating for the size of the shop and everything is so clean. Also, during the warmer months, you can enjoy a drink on their little patio. 

We definitely enjoyed the vibe of this place and their beer selections were all really fairly priced and we definitely buoyed everything we tried. I do wish they had a little bit more variety, but for the size of the bar, they had a pretty good selection of different types of beer."

We also ordered the chocolate hazelnut mousse cake which was a bit rich and cappuccinos to warm us up and make us happy in the evening. Service was alright. Got in at the right time before the long line. It's kind of a disarray, but It was understandable. There's a few bar seats looking out the window, but mostly outside seating. It's a a cute little bakery that also serves coffee, tea, and hot chocolate and has breads, cakes, macarons. Check them out! It's a nice spot in downtown St. Pete on Beach Drive. Prices are not too bad considering the area either."

The 3 women working were not friendly. Got a snide laugh from one and an eye roll from the cashier when I checked to make sure I had ordered a grande. Then a deadpan ""yes it's a grande"" with eye roll. The two were so rude. Had asked for no foam and it came with foam but wasn't about to take it back to them for fear they would spit in my drink.

The only other time I was there was today about 6 pm with my son to get some ice cream. The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. There was minimal selection.

I didn't think the cake was dry and just tasted like cake. I was pretty bummed but I don't think I will be coming back to this bakery again. I would have rather had a little more cake.

The used to have a great selection of different scents that they stopped making. Basil, Vert Frais, ect. The store in Reno was just wonderful! The salespeople were super friendly and accommodating. I found a wonderful new scent. White Gardenia! It normally is $30 for the 3 piece set but on sale for $15. They also have a room spray so I got a couple of those, everything was 50% off on Black Friday. As soon as the sets go on sale again I'm gonna get a few more for future gifts. $15 is a great deal a set."

The quality of the fruit and veggies aren't all the best, but you can find some decent ones that aren't bruised or nicked.  If you are looking for cheap salad with an expiry date within a day or so, you can find it here! For 50 or 75 cents, you can get a bagged salad that is typically $3-$4 elsewhere.  They had great deals such as 98 cents for peaches, and I bought a garlic bulb for 13 cents! 

They charge 5 cents for a bag but they also have boxes if you want to load up your product.  I find it's busy but never too busy when time to pay.  Definitely great place to come to pick up produce."
Food,4.5,OR,"Wow. 

Great space, bunches of beers -- so many crazy interesting things happening. But what I really dug was even the crazy things they're doing are palatable -- they aren't making crazy beers that are disgusting to drink. Everything has a good classic beer root, but they're adding flavors and taking things in directions you'd never expect while keeping a great beer in your glass.

Aside from the bartender having an air of ""I'm sick of all you people and I'm not going to engage my customers with more than a short, stilted series of grunts and eye-rolls"" I really loved this place. I've tried them at the Great American Beer Festival before, when could because the line is always 50 people long, and now I see why.

Awesome beers, great space -- highly recommended for any brewery hound!"
Food,3.0,OR,"Since CVS opened, I've had some medical issues that require a goodly number of prescriptions. I've completely changed my opinion. While the regular up front staff sometimes seem bored and unwilling to bother with a customer (not often) the pharmacists are excellent. They really take the time to help you work through your questions and make sure there are no drug interactions. I usually go at night when it's less busy, and I've never been made to feel like I was wasting anyone's time. The night pharmacists are especially great, even with the phone ringing off the hook.

I've noticed fewer pharmacy techs, but the ones that are there are more knowledgeable. I really appreciate the changes made at this CVS. It seems like they've worked hard to retrain staff or pare down to the good core employees."

We have done tastings 2 of the 3 times visiting there and have found new and fun things each time to try. My favorite right now is their Dry Syrah Rose, it is perfect for the summertime and is affordable to have on deck anytime a party might arise. My husband enjoyed the Laser Fox and the Swamp Donkey red. This is a place we will continue to go to and our out of town visitors alway request to go here as part of the agenda when visiting Boise. So we look forward to more wine experiences and fun at Split Rail Winery in the future."

I've had Brown Butter Almond Brickle (SO GOOD, one of my favorites), Salted Peanut Butter (again, DELICIOUS), Salty Caramel (more standard, but still delish), and Mango (super summery flavor)

The one (actually two) gripes that I have about Jeni's is the portion sizes and price. For the amount that you're paying ($5 for the smallest), you get these two absolutely tiny scoops of ice cream. I'm willing to pay just because I love the flavors so much, but this is easily a limiting factor when determining whether to go here or not."
Food,2.0,CG,"One of those most disgusting things I've ever had. I will never ever go back to this place. If you want to get your money's worth, you're going to get it elsewhere. I had the best day at a local coffee shop. I was greeted by the lovely staff and the owners. I was also greeted by a young lady who made me feel like I was at a different coffee shop. She was extremely kind and made my day. I will definitely be back!I've been to this store a few times. I love that they have a parking lot in front and a couple other spots. The employees are super nice and helpful."
Food,4.5,CG,"McConnell's is one of my favorite ice cream places in Reno. My husband and I have been coming here since we moved to Reno. The ice cream is the best in Reno. I love that it's local and not in the same strip mall. If you're looking for something different than the typical ice cream place, this is it. The ice cream is great. There is also a lot of seating inside. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I like that they have a ton of flavors to choose from. You can get ice cream from the menu and you can choose just about any flavor you want. They also have a wide variety of toppings."
Food,4.5,CG,So so so good!!!!  We will be back!!!!I've been going to this location since it was a little bit of a drive from my house but the service has gotten worse. The first time I went there I was told I would have to wait for 20 minutes to get my drink. I was told it was time to leave because I had to wait 30 minutes for my drink. I was very disappointed. I tried to explain it to the manager because it was so very unprofessional and it was very upsetting. I'm sure she was really upset that I was there. I was very upset with the service. I would have given it a 4 star but I'm not sure how
Food,4.5,CG,"First time coming here and it was the worst experience. I will not be going back. If you go to this location, you will be told by the manager ""you are closed"". We go to this store and get the same horrible experience. If you go to this store you should also go to Target. They are the most disgusting place ever. I will never go back to this location again.This is the first time I've ever been to this location. I came here for the first time this morning and I was so excited. I love that they have a coffee bar in the back with their pour over. I love their coffee, it's not overly sweet, and the staff"
Food,4.5,CG,"It opened today on 07/24 at 1:30pm.  There were about 4 employees.  There was a line out the door and then the manager came to the front and helped us.  

We waited a bit for the employee to come to the front.  We waited about 15 minutes to order and it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks.  We waited another 30 minutes to get our drinks.  The manager was very rude and very unprofessional.  We were standing there for 15 minutes.  I will never go back to this location.  We will not be returning.  Please do not go here.  I don't know how they"
Food,2.5,CG,"Maybe I phrase my questions here. The only reason I don't give this place a 4 star is because I am a huge beer drinker and have never had a bad beer. This place is a great place to get a beer, especially if you are not a beer drinker. I love the name and the atmosphere and the owner is very friendly and knowledgeable. I wish I could give more stars but I would not give them five stars.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite is the strawberry cake, but the carrot cake is my favorite! Their red velvet cake is also a must try. They also have a lot of vegan options! I love their"
Food,3.5,OR,"First experience with ice cream rolls here. The menu is overwhelmingly large with way too many options (good and bad I guess). Colorful walls and decor inside with plenty seating options. I got the matcha ice cream with matcha crystal boba + lychee jelly + peach popping boba. It was delicious and presentation was on point. However matcha flavor can be a little more stronger and flavorful but I've tried worst places for matcha ice cream that had little to no flavor so it wasn't too big of a deal for me. I did originally want to try ""matcha lady"" which is matcha ice cream with fresh strawberry fruits but they told me they've ran out of strawberry for a few days so that was a little disappointing. 
I would definitely return to try other flavors and options!"
Food,4.0,OR,"Really disappointed in our visit. My boyfriend and I drove 35+ minutes down from Nashville solely to pick out our own pumpkins from their patch. We decided to pay the admission fee to see the farm, but it turns out it's only really for kids and families -- not much for adults to do. The ""hay ride"" (there was no hay?) was just a loop around the cows and the maze was just a 5 minute walk through some corn. Perhaps I'm just an old 26-year old grump. We wanted to get our pumpkins on our way out, but every. single. pumpkin. in the patch was either rotted or in pieces. They only had decent ones in a display area where they were selling them for $$$. Kind of took the fun out of picking your own pumpkin."
Food,2.5,OR,"I am a frequent visitor here.  I have never had a problem with the service at this starbucks.  Only one out of my gazillion times have i ever had a complaint about my drink, which they remade promptly.  

If you see the drive-thru line one car further past the menu just go inside, it would be quicker (as long as there isn't a huge line inside).  

As far as coffeehouses in the metro-east illinois area, they are lacking.  There have been a few that have tried but starbucks just puts them out of business.  I hate that for the local coffee shops, however, i love the hours of starbucks open from 5-11 most days so its a great place to get my homework done.  Great access to the highway as well."
Food,4.0,OR,"Honestly it's pretty average tasting coffee. I got the coffee to sit and drink in the shop itself. Even with cream and sugar, it was very bland. And I got a dark roast. Plus, it was in a ceramic cup that may seem cute and charismatic to others looking over at your table, but walking to the counter and to your table is a huge hassle. The coffee was filled to the top with no trash can to dump it. The mug and plate it was on was broken in several places from others more likely than not dropping it. I can only image how dreadful that might've been. I didn't try the pastries, but I don't believe they were on display anyway so it wasn't on my mind. It was just average. I probably won't go back."
Food,3.0,OR,"The product values are the only reason to go to this store. Customer service is awful. I have actually brought my own employees to  the Cinnaminson location to witness what bad customer service can do to guests of a building. Because of work I need to visit SAMs about once a week for the last three years and on many occasions I drive further to Target just to get a better experience. Again, besides the prices, this place is a nightmare and somewhere I hate going when I need too. I have had bad interactions from all employees which tells me the lack of focus on customer service comes from the top down. The only time I had great help was from Roberto in electronics. This location is the worst retail establishment I have ever been into."
Food,3.5,OR,"Delicious and they do a beautiful job putting these treats together.
But...and a very big ""but""...
Very expensive and expect long waits during peak times. Plus, you have a lot of younger workers so it can feel a bit chaotic behind the counter, so maybe expect a little anxiety with your milkshake. When we were there it seemed as there was some type of argument amongst the employees. I'm always weary of establishments when employees argue with each other out in the open, right in front of customers. 
We are a family of six and got a little bit of everything. Nothing disappointed.
Personally, I'm not a fan of sweets. But the ice cream wasn't overwhelmingly sweet and some of the flavors were truly unique. 
As a tourist though, I would say it's a must visit,
especially after eating Nashville hot chicken."
Food,4.5,CG,"Stopped by based on a recommendation from the bartender and decided to try it out. I was pretty disappointed. The beer was pretty good, but the food was not great. The food was ok, but I didn't really care for the food. I would come back to try the food.I was looking for a place to go get some ice cream and was so happy to find this place! My husband and I went to the shop and they had some great ice cream flavors and some really interesting flavors! My husband got the strawberry shortcake and he got the peanut butter cup which was a great addition to our ice cream! The shop was super cute and clean. We will definitely be back"
Food,4.5,CG,"Decent beer, better spot. I'll go back and try more. I will keep my glass in the fridge.I've had the best donuts at the grocery store ever, and it's pretty much the best.  It's a little pricey for a donut, but it's worth it.  They have a nice variety of flavors, including glazed and maple glazed.  They are very reasonably priced, and I love the fact that they have some sugar free options, so if you want to try them, I'd recommend.  I love that they have a parking lot in front and a couple other spots.  

I love the concept of this place"
Food,4.5,CG,"OMG!! They have ice cream, ice cream, and sorbet. 

The staff is always so friendly and the ice cream is delicious. The staff is always so nice and friendly. 

You can get a large scoop of ice cream if you want to share. You can also get 2 scoops of ice cream if you want to share with friends.

The woman at the counter was very friendly, but the place was packed and the place was packed.  I would have liked to see some seating and maybe some seating.  I think it's just a bad day and I'm not sure if it was a bad day or just a bad day.  I'm sure it's just a bad day, but I think I would have liked to see some seating, but I would have loved to see more seating.  Maybe next time I'll try a different flavor.

Food,3.0,OR,"Wow. I go to Starbucks at least once a day and I've never had a bad experience until tonight. The customer service was horrible and no big deal that he made the wrong sized drink, but when he went to remake it, he used the old drink to put into the new cup, added no new whip cream, it was runny and he left it all sticky and didn't wipe it off or offer napkins and when I asked for my receipt, he said he couldn't find it. I asked to speak to a manager and he said there wasn't one on duty. Unfortunate that every other Starbucks I've been to has cheerful, polite workers who seem to love their job but these employees seemed to hate life and customers. Coffee should make people happy."
Food,4.5,OR,"I really cannot believe this business is not on yelp! Although the foot long is now $5.50, this place is still a great bargain. These people provide the best deal I know on campus. I always get the 6 inch steak meal, and I can never finish it all in one meal and I save the rest for dinner later. I love their fries, which are the best I have had on campus. They are crunchy, but soft and potato-y on the inside.

The lady at the truck is so nice too.  One time, after I had not been there for a while I came for what I always order.  I did not expect her to remember me, but she did. I love coming to this place and I kinda wish I could have those fries right now."
Food,3.0,OR,"Conveniently located, this store is a bonus to the neighborhood. Easy to get in or out of day or night with a great variety of staples and then some. That's the good stuff... now here's the unfortunate part. Purchased poultry from the meat section that was dated to expire two days from date of purchase. Got home and opened the package on the same day only to find the product had already spoiled even though the sell by date was in the future. Went back the next time and found cold cuts cut to half price. Unfortunately the sell by date on these was one day prior. Is it even legal to sell cured meats after the sell by date? There is definitely a freshness issue at this store. Avoid the produce and meats... otherwise it's a good place."
Food,4.0,OR,"Whenever I'm in the area, this is a stop that is necessary! This bookstore/brewery combo is the best collaboration since the Pizza Hut/Taco Bell. The staff is well-read and have gotten smarter with their beer. They know what to keep. They know what to tweak. They know what to bottle. The sours have become worthy of mention. I recommend you start with a flight to get to know Books and Brews and where they're coming from. You can get coupons on your birthday and for using certain credit cards. 

If you need to eat, they have the most reasonably priced meat and cheese plates in the world. The half Frankenstein is enough for a meal. The sandwiches are great and they use some local folks for their cheeses and chips....maybe more. 

Books in the front. Party in the back."
Food,4.5,CG,"Highly, enjoyed the energy of the barista. 

We will be back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and she said no.  I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.  I was turned away by her attitude.  She was very rude and condescending.  I don't understand why she is so rude.  I felt very uncomfortable and she was not pleasant.  I will not be returning.I have been going here for over 10 years and it is the best"
Food,4.5,CG,This is more than a few miles away from my house but it's close to the park and has a drive thru. The staff is always friendly and the store is clean. I go here often and it's convenient. The only downside is it's not very close to my house. I always get a latte and the baristas are very friendly and helpful. I've also had a couple of drinks there and I like the atmosphere and the location. I will definitely be back!I've been to this store a few times.  I love that they have a parking lot in front and a couple other spots.  The employees are super nice and helpful.  It's a very convenient location
Food,3.5,CG,"I love this location.  They have the best ice cream I have ever had.  I just wish they had more unique flavors.  I also love the fact that you can bring your own food.  It's a good place to bring your kids as well.The best ice cream I have ever had. I love the flavor combos, the flavors are great, and the staff is very nice. I recommend the salted caramel and the pistachio ice cream. I love their ice cream. I would highly recommend the caramel.I've been here several times, and I'm always a fan of their ice cream.  They have a variety of flavors, and the workers are very friendly"
Food,4.5,CG,At the last minute we had an amazing time! We loved it! Thank you!Very rude. Went in at around 3:15pm and the lady behind the counter was very rude. She was rude and rude. She said she was working on the phone and she was not interested in helping us. She was also rude and rude. I'll never go back to this store ever again. This place is amazing! I was there for the first time last night and I had to go for a bit of something. The menu is a little overwhelming but I was able to try a few different things before I settled on the vanilla ice cream. The staff was super friendly and helpful.

Food,2.0,CG,"It's a WalMart and I'm not sure if they'd make it better or if they'd make it better. 

If you're looking for some basic essentials, this is the place to go. 

There are a few things that are not available to purchase here, but the people working there are very friendly and helpful. 

There are several grocery stores in the area that offer great sales and specials, and it is nice to be able to buy a few things from the store without having to wait in a long line. 

The store is always clean and tidy. 

I like that they have a Starbucks in the same shopping plaza. "

Food,4.0,OR,"I was fairly disappointed with my dining experience at tillys a couple days ago. It was a lot like what you would expect in a department store restaurant... very mediocre just convenient. But in this case it was so slow that it wasn't even convenient. 

The waitress was extremely scattered throughout the hour and a half that I was there. It took over 30 minutes to get 2 salads.... I ordered the salmon salad. The salmon was overcooked. The greens looked and tasted like romaine straight out of a bag. Then a couple cucumber cubes were just thrown on the plate. It just wasn't the elegant plate I expected. I had planned on ordering the scone but didn't want to prolong the meal any further. The ambiance is very cold. It feels unfinished. I can't imagine coming back for lunch."
Food,3.0,OR,"The staff here is great and the beer selection, while not isn't overly extensive, is commendable. This was my first visit (and I've lived in the neighborhood for 4 year) - I appreciated the staff and selection of good brews so much I will definitely be back. I had my toddler with me and one of the ladies saw I had my hands full (with a toddler, not necessarily alcohol!) and took my purchases to the counter for me while I perused the beer. Also, the first employee I spoke to about a specific liquor I was picking up took me right to it. And finally, they have several taps for grower fills and that selection also looked good. Glad for more growler fills on the west side! Can't say anything about the wine since I'm not a wine drinker."
Food,4.0,OR,"I have known about this place forever and I'm not sure why I waited so long to visit.  I mean, wine!! This place is fantastic!! They have an amazing selection if wines from a ton of different regions in the world.  They do tastings so you can sample a wide variety of wines. They staff is knowledgeable and extremely personable and happy to reccomend wine to fit your taste and mood.  We loved their suggestions.  The pricing runs from scary cheap to break the bank. Don't let the prices fool you, though. We found a saucy 6.99 bottle from Australia that's is now in my favorites. They also, have a cigar room and selection of beers.  If you are ready to shpp local and try some new fun wines, this is the place to visit."
Food,3.5,OR,"The iced coffee late, croissants and pain au chocolat were really good but the hot chocolate was really tasteless and when we complained it was not good we were just told to add sugar!!!? I think the decor while looking good and contemporary is not cosy and the seats are very uncomfortable. The layout is weird and you cannot seat too many people in this huge space. Finally, I really did not appreciate that when you pay with a credit card you are forced to leave a tip as on the iPad were you leave your signature after paying they give you the option of leaving a tip for 15, 20 or 25 percent when there is no table service and you even have to clear your own table!!! This place is a let down. I would not recommend it."
Food,3.0,OR,"Always great service at the pharmacy. Horrible service with management! I made a purchase of an air fryer and when I opened it ,it was a used one and returned and they put it back on the shelf. They could not find the purchase and I used my phone number and when they had me download the app to look at my purchases there were no purchases at all on my card at all! I have been a customer for over 20 years! And recently a pharmacy customer. When I asked why they just told me to call customer service that all they could do was a gift card. That's horrible service!?? I emailed customer service and since they also could not find any purchases ,I got absolutely nowhere! I guess they do not need the sales during these times?"
Food,4.0,OR,"I saw this place on some show on the Travel Channel, and when my wife and i made plans to go to Phillie for a night, I shut my eyes real tight..clenched my fists...and, no...I wasn't constipated...I was searching for the name of this establishent in the vast catalog of ""places to go"" I have filed in my head. They have some great concoctions here and the hard part is narrowing it down. We technically should have shared a sundae..like normal people..but since we were Franklin Fountain virgins, we got one each and proceeded to engage in the act of one of the Seven Deadly Sins...that being Gluttony. I got a Mt Vesuvius...vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, brownie bites, malt powder. Awesome. The place is modeled after an old time ice cream shop...so decor is 1910's/1920's. Go. Now."
Food,3.0,OR,"Prior to last night I have never had an issue, but that was not the case. Around 9pm last night, I visited this location, I was not greeted by the team on the floor. While I work in customer service and understand individuals may be occupied, a simple ""hey"" would have sufficed. But that is not my complaint. After finally being acknowledged, the gentleman began to scoop my ice cream, in which I noticed the fly. Apparently he noticed it as well, since he tried to discreetly call his coworker. I assume she was the shift lead, she reached into the ice cream without gloves picked the fly out of the ice cream barrel with her unwashed bare hands. I believe her name was Miranda. I couldn't believe what I witnessed and left without my item."

If you want to get your coffee and then have a customer experience, I would recommend taking a look elsewhere.Love this place! The staff are always very friendly and the selection is amazing. They have a nice variety of flavors and toppings. I love the brownie sundae. I always get the custard and the salted caramel. I like that they have a separate section for toppings.

Food,4.0,OR,"When they first moved into the neighborhood, I was saving close to $60 each week on my grocery bill, but over the last couple months, they've inched up their prices on all of the items people are really wanting to save money on ie, meats, cheeses, paper products. I had hoped this store would be an alternative to Aldi, but it has become more of an ""in addition to"" kind of place. They still have the best milk prices in town and the only acceptable Velveeta alternative. It's a bummer because I really liked being able to shop at one store instead of running around town getting my staples at one store and hitting up the major chains for their sale items. If they reduce their prices back to what we saw in the beginning, I would give them five stars."
Food,4.5,OR,"My favorite thing about traveling is finding awesome local coffee shops. Tourist traps are overrated ya know?! 

If you're looking for a quiet, full of ambiance, local and delicious coffee shop...this is the place for you. Within blocks of all the touristy spots, this makes a great stop before a day full of exploring. 

Plenty of coffee options, milk options, pastry options, & my favorite- a seasonal menu. The barista was friendly in helpful with making my decision. I opted for a hot maple cinnamon oat milk latte & it was devine!!! Definitely recommend. Everything is made to order and mine sure tasted like it was made with love. 

Ambiance is quite lovely! Plenty of work space, I recommend the little nook area to the right of the coffee bar. 

Such a good find. Will be back when in the area."
Food,1.5,OR,"Highly disappointed in this little place, sadly.  Had a hankering for some ice cream one night on my way home. I thought all Baskin Robbins had 31 flavors so I call up hubby and ask him what flavor he wants. Go through the drive through and request two different flavors with the guy telling me they had neither so I decided to go inside and check out what the heck happened to the ice cream!

There were only like 1/2 the flavors. Neither hubby's nor my favorites were in this franchise!  Settled on a couple of others with a mental note to look a little more closely at Baskin Robbins to make sure one I'm stopping at has the full 31 flavor experience. Is this a typical Florida thing or am I just spoiled by the Evansville, Indiana Baskin Robbins?"
Food,2.5,OR,"Robeks is awesome! I don't understand the bad reviews AT ALL. The food definitely deserves a five star review. This is a sparkling clean restaurant. I had an absolutely delicious açaí bowl. I am so happy that I found a place that serves this trendy menu item. And they make it right. If you have never tried an açaí bowl yet, this is the place to go. I tried the mango acai bowl, but I'll be back to try other varieties. They also have a fantastic hot cider-tea. It is hot cider mixed with tea and spices. Very creative menu. 

Yes, I did ask for a menu modification because of my food allergy, and yes, I was happily accommodated. 

Check this place out! Try an açaí bowl! (For a reasonably price of under $8). You will not be sorry you did."
Food,3.0,OR,"To me, 1 star = not eatable. So I gave it 2.

It was a booth in Santa Barbara farmer market on state street. Got the old fashion apple pie cause I wanted to avoid the extra calories from French apple pie. I guess that was the mistake. I should either go with full calories or just walk away.

Straight to the pie. First bite, I felt sorry for the apple. Second bite, I felt sorry for my money. The apple filling was soggy and mushy. Bottom crust was ok but the top crust.... I don't know how to express my disappointment. That piece of ______ took 7.50 bucks away from my pocket and I felt so sad to throw the money in dumpster. 

I will avoid this booth at all cost later. Given that kinda money, I can make better pie myself."

Food,5.0,CG,"We visited in recently after hearing about the wide variety of flavors they offer, and I was excited to find a cupcake place in our area. The shop itself is pretty small, and the place was pretty busy. I got a scoop of one of the most popular flavors, and I loved it. The place itself is very cute, and the owner was very nice. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who has a sweet tooth!Great experience, friendly staff, good selection of wine, and a friendly staff. You can tell they care about the products they are doing. I highly recommend this spot!They have a great selection of wine, but the prices are not what I am used to."
Food,2.5,CG,"Wish I would have read more about the quality of their coffee. 

The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. 

The only thing I wish they would improve was the service. I ordered a double espresso and a double espresso with soy milk. I got the double espresso with soy milk and it was very good. It had a very strong coffee taste to it, but it was still very watery and not very sweet. It's not usually my first choice, but I would have liked to try a different flavor. 

Overall, I'd say it's worth a visit to get a cup of coffee and"
Food,4.0,CG,"In spite of social distancing, this place is an absolute must if you are in the area! 

The employees are super nice, and they're always very helpful when you ask about the product. 

There are a few coffee shops in the area that I've never been to that don't have a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, and they are definitely the ones that will make my day. 

This place is on my way to work, and I'm so glad to have this one in the area. 

I'm so happy I got here, and will be back!A must try if you're in the area. We were in town visiting and found"
Food,3.5,CG,"Stopped in today to check out the bakery. 

We were greeted by the owner, who is so sweet and accommodating. The cakes were delicious! We bought a few cakes and were able to order online. 

I was excited to try some of the other desserts. I had a chocolate chip cookie, the chocolate cake, and the blueberry cake. All were great. I was hoping for something different, but it was just too sweet for me. I got the chocolate chunk cake, which is vanilla with cream cheese frosting, and it was delicious! I was a little disappointed by the frosting, because it was a little too sweet. The chocolate chunk cake was good too,"
Food,4.5,OR,Me and my hubby love to try new breweries no matter where we are. I saw this on yelp they only had 3 reviews so I was a bit scared to stop in. Now after all the beers I've tried I am surprised they don't have a higher rating and more reviews I am from CA and to be honest I'm a bit picky. I was so pleasantly surprised with this brewery. They have some outstanding beers! Must trys!! Like the Tomcat pumpkin spice latte on nitro...Wow!!! The Forged affogato white stout..freakin amazing!!! Honestly I'm a ipa girl and yes the grunged double ipa was delish. So was the sabrosa Mexican style ipa was nice! All in all this place is awesome great staff atmosphere was cool and they pizza in house sadly we already ate otherwise we would have tried it!
Food,5.0,OR,Before leaving SB this morning I had to stop for some coffee (obviously). Searched yelp and came across this place. Super glad I tried it! It's such a cute coffee shop and has a great patio area to sit and enjoy the day. The barista was super friendly as well! I ordered an iced oat milk latte. I usually get almond milk but they don't have almond milk at this place... But the oat milk was actually really good with the coffee! Usually I can taste the strong flavor of the oat milk but here it was very subtle and mixed with the coffee perfectly! It was pretty strong (just the way it should be!). They also had free stickers at the register. Which I love to collect. It's a must try coffee place if you're in the area! 10/10 for me.
Food,4.5,OR,"Lock Stock is another great addition to Edmonton's burgeoning downtown coffee scene. Attached to Red Star Pub, Lock Stock shares Red Star's low-key but elegant décor and offers delicious coffee and baked goods.

Lock Stock can be hard to find at first, located down the stairs that lead to Red Star and the Bower and barely marked with any signage. Upon entering, the narrow but comfortable space leads to a coffee counter which serves delicious Danesi coffee and treats like delicious mini-carrot cake.

There's not much else to say about Lock Stock, other than that its relatively discreet location and unassuming appearance is perfect for a quick drink or a long chat away from the usual hustle and bustle of Jasper ave during the day. The coffee is great, the space is unique and it is another great addition to Edmonton's coffee shop boom."
Food,4.0,OR,"I've been to the other locations before and wanted to treat my mom to their delicious ice cream. This was the closest location so we popped in. It's smaller than Lake St Louis location, but much larger than Clayton. 

They had a great variety and the employees were friendly. I had my standard gooey butter and the midnight chocolate (BTW why do I keep ordering 2 flavors when I really just want all gooey butter?!). 

My mom ordered the salted caramel and dressed it up with fancy pecans and whipped cream and she really enjoyed it. I will say my mom was disappointed that the waffle bowl sits partially in another bowl but not enough that she could eat the waffle bowl without the ice cream falling out... may be better to serve that on a plate where it can be enjoyed."
Food,4.5,OR,"I savored every spoonful of my cold, sweet summer treat. Their gelatis are really good--the water ice makes it so. I asked for cherry water ice and vanilla custard ice cream. The girl taking my order asked if I wanted regular cherry or the ""big cherry."" I'm glad she asked because I didn't realize they offered two types of cherry water ice. Usually when I get a gelati, I get either mango or cherry water ice. I ended up getting the Big Cherry Bordeaux water ice which has yummy cherry pieces throughout. It was quite good and tasty and paired very well with the vanilla custard ice cream. They have a myriad of water ice and ice cream flavors that you'll either have a hard time choosing or certainly find something you'll want. The prices are reasonable and the  portions large."
Food,3.5,CG,"It was Sunday afternoon and there were people with long hair.

The staff was friendly and we sat down at the bar. The bartender took our order and offered to take it back to us. We sat down in the back room for about 15 minutes and then some people brought their drinks and a couple of others came out and started talking about how the place was going to be.

We went on a Saturday night and it was really crowded. We had to wait for our drinks and to get back to the bar. The bar was empty and there was a bar just standing there and it was really crowded. We sat at the bar and waited.

The food was ok, I like the cheese"
Food,4.5,CG,"You'll find this gem in Tampa. The owner is super friendly and knowledgeable about the products and the products. If you want to try new products and then have a great experience, check this place out. The store is in a very small strip mall. This store is located in a lot of other strip malls. They have the most convenient parking and have a great selection of products. They have a lot of organic items and some random items that you don't see at other stores. The store is very clean and well organized. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I recommend this store to everyone. I've been here twice. The first time it was not as busy as the first time I went."

I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service. I've tried a few of the coffee and they all always taste great. The drive thru is always fast and easy, and the staff are always very friendly. I love the fact that they are always there when I need something sweet.

I had a coupon for a free grocery pick-up. The coupon was free, and I picked up a few items. The store was clean and organized. There was also a deli counter.

I picked up some meat and cheese on my way home. I will say I went with the turkey sausage, it was really good. The prices are very reasonable. The store is very clean and organized. The staff was very nice and helpful.

Food,3.0,OR,"I happen to love Dierbergs..... pre-Covid!  The location on Eager Rd. has taken the time to:

Put markers on their floors for social distancing
Make periodic announcements to keep your 6 feet
Build plexiglass cages around their cashiers

This all seems so safe and responsible.  Except that when I go to check out, the bagger lady is wearing her mask UNDER her chin.  I am wearing gloves and a mask to protect her but she is now touching and breathing on EVERY item coming down the belt.  I mentioned it to a manager who asked me if I wanted to reshop all of my items.  What I wanted was for her to tell this employee to cover her face.  Manager never moved and the next customer got the same exposure.  

Love you Dierbergs, but you are not worth the risk."
Food,2.5,OR,"My recent grocery shopping experience was a bit frustrating. I was almost complete with my list and only needed toilet paper, water and chocolate drizzled popcorn. That's when I realized the usual locations of these items had be moved. After walking back and forth, I finally found the items, but they weren't in their designated location. Some items for example, the popcorn, was in neither the chip aisle or the vending aisle, but up against the wall near the soda. 

Despite this recent shopping experiencing, i still enjoy shopping here. It's nice and clean, the employees spark conversations, food sample hour is great, and I particularly like the atmosphere during the week. All in all, if you cannot find something make sure to ask! Don't be like me, and wonder around until you find it. The employees will be happy to help you."
Food,4.5,OR,"Rabble is just blocks away from Mass Ave, but it's in a neighborhood that my friend said ""has a lot of potential...but isn't there yet."" 

Rabble is a hole in the wall in the sense that we drove past it twice before we figured out where it was. The vibe is laidback and comfortable - grab a mug off the wall to fill up. I got a tea and slice of quiche and it came to $5 - pretty good pricing for a coffee shop, in my opinion.

The two bummers of my visit were 1) I ordered an iced green tea since it was a humid day, but I received a hot tea and 2) I had to prompt the barista that I had ordered a quiche but hadn't received it. He had forgotten. Regardless, it was good quiche (spinach, feta, red pepper)."
Food,3.0,OR,"OK, I like this place. It's HUGE, and full of stuff I want. It's very possible that I spend more money, because things look like such a good deal! We buy bulk items that are two to three times the amount for almost the same price for a single. That makes no sense does it? OK, I buy one bulk package containing three large ketchup bottles, for the price I pay for one at the grocery store. (give or take). It's normally a pretty busy store, with TVs, and mattresses, cases of booze just flying out of the door. 

We routinely buy tax-ables like TP, laundry detergent, paper towels, dog food. It lasts a LONG time. 

Like I said, I'm not sure if I really save any money. Membership is sixty bucks a year, (roughly) . But, I feel like I do?!? 

Lol."
Food,4.5,OR,"Excellent place to get poke! The salmon and tuna are cut in big chunks and aren't too cold. I did a mix of the creamy sauce and sesame shoyu, and it turned out very nicely. They have the usual options for base, toppings, and extras. Except, they have roasted beets, and I love beets! I wouldn't think that beets would go in a poke bowl but it actually works nicely, and I hope they keep that option! They have paper straws, and if you eat in you get a real bowl and a plastic tumbler for your drink. The two young women working there were super friendly. A plus is a nicely decorated and clean bathroom. The patio looked inviting but it was hot so we ate inside. All in all, I'd visit Pola Poke again! I'd like to try their açaí bowls."
Food,4.0,CG,"So I'm not typically a huge fan of the chain coffee shops in Reno, but this was one of them. I had the banana, egg and cheese croissant. The croissant was a little hard to chew, but it was moist and flakey. The croissant was a bit too sweet for me. I'm not sure if it was due to the pastries being just a tad dry, or if it was just too sweet for me. I think I would have liked to get one of the sandwiches. I liked the almond croissant. I didn't get a chance to try any of the other baked goods, but I do know what I am missing."

I love the flavors and the service. I wish I could get some of their other flavors every time. I have tried the banana flavor, the strawberry and the strawberry. All of them are good. I recommend the fruit flavor. The strawberry one is the best. This is a great place for a quick bite on a hot summer day. I love that they have a great selection of beer and wine. I especially like the fact that they have a nice selection of cider. I love their Christmas decor."

It was clear that he was trying to be rude to customers.   I had a woman in front of me and she was very rude and didn't speak well enough.  I was turned away by the young man who was on her phone and a woman in front of me.  I felt uncomfortable and the manager immediately walked out of the store.   I was very upset with this and will not be returning to this store.  They could have handled this if they had some other

I saw a lot of people were just looking for a specific beer and I found out that they have a couple in the case and that they have a couple of in stock. I ordered a flight and two flights. I had a flight and ended up going with a flight of four different beers. I was really impressed. I was quite surprised to see that there was a few beers I didn't like. I'm not a beer fan, but I was looking for a particular beer that I liked. They had a few different types of beers that I like. They also have a couple of snacks that I didn't care for."
Food,4.5,OR,"I've been walking by this place almost everyday since it opened and stopped by a couple times for a quick coffee here and there, but every time I've had a hankering for one of their bagels, they were ALWAYS sold out! I finally caved and just ended up buying a garlic and herb focaccia as a side for a dinner I'm preparing this evening. I had a little as a snack, and then a little more (you know how it goes) and I have to say, it is definitely one of the best loaves of bread I've ever had. Can't wait to share with dinner guests! It's on the pricier side, at $7, but worth the splurge for a special dinner or treat. Still have to try the bagels, but given how good the bread was, I'm sure their famous bagel will not disappoint!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Great little mini golf place and delicious shaved ice. We went at night while visiting St Louis over a weekend (on a whim) and had a great time. The golf course is cute and has some fun challenges and names for each of the holes. If you get a hole in one on a particular hole for that day you could win a free shaved ice! You won't know till after you're done playing though ;)
The guy who runs the place was also super friendly! Only knock down a star because there was a weird smell on some parts, not sure if it's something that is to help with mosquitoes- which if it is that's not too bad because I didn't get bit much on the course but I did get attacked a bit while figuring out what shaved ice flavor I wanted lol."
Food,4.0,OR,"Sorry Philly Flavors- you have some competition! I fell in love with this place last summer when I stumbled upon it. The concept is pure genious- pick your flavor of icecream or yogurt ( hard or soft serve) and then pick from the list of many many mix ins- everything from cream cheese to captain crunch to cofee powder and all of the basic candies in between. They take your selections and put the entire mixture through a machine that basically makes you a custom soft served blend! AMAZING!  The place is so adorable too. Checkered floor, old school candy counter.  It's  feels like you're at the mom and pop ice cream shop down the shore.

I want to give a shot out to RowZone for relocating to across the street from Scoops- my workout will officially go down the drain now!"
Food,4.5,OR,"It's Trader Joes. I won't spend too much time going into detail about the concept or the chain in general, but rather, I'll mention a few things about this specific location.

Pros:
-They are very generous with their samples- it's always great to try new foods that I may not have purchased before!
-I've never encountered an unfriendly employee.
-Everything is always in stock!

Cons:
-Parking is a NIGHTMARE. Steer clear of peak hours, or you will have lots of trouble finding parking, or if you do find parking, it will take forever to get out of the lot and back onto Hillsboro Pike!
-Not enough variety of fresh (not frozen) pre-seasoned meats and fish. I love grilling, but if I want something to buy and bring home to grill, Trader Joe's is not the place to go. They only have one or two choices for pre-seasoned fish that's not frozen."
Food,1.5,OR,If I had to sum up the place in one word it would be incompetence. If you go inside to order it's chaos. Always out of the donuts I want and one time I went in to order a dozen and they told me they were out of Boston creme. As I get something else and then go to pay I see the guy come out with a fresh batch after he told me they were out. I asked if I could switch them out he said no. Ok whatever. Screw you guys lol. Clueless staff too. Oh and don't ever get coffee here. You get the opposite of whatever you order. Normally I don't review fast food places because fast food is mediocre at best but this location is really bad. But it's not dunkins fault its absence of management at this location.
Food,3.5,OR,"What a great shop for the location. If South Street is a little too much for you, this laid back beer emporium should be all you need for a relaxed evening. The owners and staff are super friendly and will help you find whatever beer you're looking for.  While they do not have food to offer, I've seen plenty of people bring in a slice or two of pizza and have been offered a plate by the owner himself to enjoy my own food. What's great about this shop is you are free to either come in and buy a bottle (or six!) to take home or hang around to enjoy them. It seems substantially cheaper than just going to a bar and the beer selection is impressive. Great prices, great beers, great people and great location - definitely a new neighborhood favorite."
Food,4.5,OR,"Is this place ever open? Can someone prove to me that it is ever open?!? I have tried four different times in the past six months to come over here and they're always closed. Voting day, cat 's birthdays, we're on COVID vacation day, and any damn day that they don't want to be open they're not open. I haven't yet been in the store so I can't write about that but right now I have to say as the only Penzeys in Indianapolis their hours stink. They close at 6 pm?!? A lot more of us are cooking right now and we don't want to be charged a fortune for shipping for a couple of little bottles.  I have a gut feeling this is some retiree's hobby store and it's being treated as such. I really hope they can prove me wrong."
Food,4.5,CG,You have heard of soft serve ice cream with lots of good things. This is the first time we have had soft serve and I am not sure how the flavor of the ice cream is made. The flavor is not in the flavor of the ice cream. This is a very good choice. We have tried the chocolate milkshake and the Oreo milkshake. All of them are good. The ice cream is not as creamy as some of the other locations. The flavors are not as creamy as other places. The ice cream is really creamy and not too sweet. I usually get a chocolate milkshake with chocolate ice cream on top. It's great if you want a creamy ice cream.
Food,3.0,CG,"This is not my neighborhood Kroger, but it is convenient. 

The store is always clean and well-stocked, and the staff is always friendly. 

The only thing I wish is that the produce section was a little bigger and more variety. The staff is always helpful. 

I go to this Kroger often because I live in the area. I always get the same thing, usually it is on sale. I always feel very welcome. 

They also have a salad bar. You can order a salad bar, salad bar, salad bar, salad bar, sushi bar, salad bar, etc. They have a Starbucks.

Food,4.5,CG,Had an amazing time at this place and the food was amazing. We had a variety of appetizers and two sandwiches. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The atmosphere was nice and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place and will be back.I love love love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best coffee. It's very quiet and spacious and the staff is friendly and helpful. I love their pastries and pastries too.

They make my drinks wrong and I'm sure it's just a matter of a personal preference. I don't understand why they don't honor the coupon, but I'm not sure why they don't honor it.

I love the fact that they have a small beer garden right by the door. The prices are very reasonable. The environment is very laid back and the staff is friendly.

Food,2.0,OR,"I don't like giving one star reviews but this place deserves it. I have twins (a boy and a girl) and they act like they've never dealt with this situation before. My daughter needed a prescription in November and despite telling EVERY single person I spoke with that she was a twin, they billed it under my son's name. 

Two weeks later he needed the same antibiotic and they told me I'd already picked it up. I once again tried telling everyone that I spoke with that he was a twin and they probably billed it wrong. They completely ignored me until two hours later (still arguing and waiting for them to call everyone). Finally someone heard the word ""twins"" and a wire connected. They finally stopped treating me like a liar and got his prescription filled while I waited 25 minutes longer. Never again."
Food,3.5,OR,"One of our favorite treats - their mix in combos are vast (including nuts, cakes, candies, fruits, and cookies) and there are more than 15 types of ice creams to serve as the foundation (including salted caramel, cotton candy, oatmeal cookie, coffee, and dark chocolate).  So why only 4-stars?  Their prices for small/medium cups or cones is high and their ice cream cake prices (pushing $40) are the highest of any.  Consistency is also a problem.  Sometimes we get outstanding (cheerful) service And large servings.  But other times, even after tipping in advance (mobile orders for example) will leave the cup barely 3/4 full or the mix-ins poorly stirred throughout the ice cream.  When they're hitting on all cylinders, they get an A+  Unfortunately, it's a bit of a crap shoot ... and I'm not an avid gambler."
Food,3.5,OR,"This was my go to place, but I don't know what has happened.  Maybe a bunch of new employees who aren't trained and who don't know the difference between an iced coffee and an iced americano.  Don't allow room for cream, even when expressly ordered this way.  Drink way watered down with water and ice.  Very disappointing, especially because this happened RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE OWNER AND HE ONLY MINIMALLY INTERVENED TO CORRECT THE SITUATION.  Customers should not have to watch the barrista's like a hawk to make sure they don't screw up.  They have a sign that says if you aren't happy with your drink they will make it again.  THAT IS A TOTAL LIE.  I really prefer Peet's Coffee and may just drive the extra distance to get the drink I am paying for."
Food,4.5,OR,"The coffee, location and ambiance are excellent. The first few times I went here, it was a great experience and I was able to get a ton of work done even with the business meetings going on around me. 

I recently visited when the new manager was there. She was very kind and friendly, but ultimately incredibly distracting. She spoke loudly with every customer and everyone who came through the cafe, played music, sang... It's excellent that she is determined to give great customer service and acknowledge people -- she was always kind and in fact, musically talented. However, the constant commotion from behind the coffee bar was disruptive. It felt like watching theater and I needed to focus on my work. 

As a regular patron, I'd like to ask that the vibe of this coffee shop return to being a professional and calm atmosphere."
Food,4.5,OR,"Just as great as the original! This location of Clementine's has all of the great features of its other location including great ice cream flavors (both boozey and non-alcoholic), great and helpful staff, and with the added feature of more seating! My first visit here was last Thursday and I enjoyed my favorite 2-scoop combo of the Chocolate Cabernet and Manhattan ice creams but in a bowl with a red velvet cone on top. It all was good, however I was charged an up charge of $.50 extra because I ordered the basic bowl with the waffle cone (the waffle cone already is an upcharge of $1). I don't believe that I was ever charged this extra fee for the bowl at the other location, but eh, what can ya do? Nonetheless, this is a great addition to the growing Clementine's chain in St. Louis."
Food,3.5,OR,"Let's make this clear right up front - I don't like Wal-Mart.  I tolerate it as a last resort, or for when I need something cheap and I don't plan on keeping it forever.  I guess it's alright for what it is, but don't even bother asking an employee for anything.  My wife was once told ""If you don't see it on the shelf, we don't carry it"" when she asked where something was at this location when it was new.  That about sums up their customer service philosophy.  Their system was also shut down the last time I tried to get a fishing license there (that's when I learned I could get one online).  This location does always appear clean and organized, so those are pluses, but I'd still rather not come here if I don't have to."
Food,4.0,CG,"The customer service at this location is the worst. The employees are rude, slow, and rude. I've had the pleasure of going to this location several times, and it's always been a pleasant experience. It's a shame because they can't get their act together. Great location with great service. I have to say that I'm not a coffee drinker but I like the atmosphere and the staff. The coffee is really good and they have some cool pastries and coffee drinks that I haven't seen anywhere else. The staff was really nice and helpful. I would definitely come back and try their other menu items. I absolutely love this place. They have a wide selection of beers and some other tasty stuff."
Food,3.5,CG,"I also wouldn't normally review a place that does not give good customer service, but I was just in here and had the best experience. I took my dog and she had a dog and we had a great time. Definitely a great place for a treat. This is my new favorite brewery in Tampa. I love this place!  I love the fact that it is a little far from my home, but I can still get a cup of coffee and some work done. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I enjoy their coffee. They also have a great selection of pastries and pastries. I haven't had a pastry yet, but I'd love to try something from them."

I will be back. I will be back. I love love this place. I love the vibe and the music. The beer is excellent. I love the fact that they have a small food menu with an additional menu. I always feel like I'm being treated like I'm something I'm eating. I've never been treated so poorly. I usually go for the wild ales. I love the crunchy fruit and the mango. It's a fun little place to hang out.

The staff is rude and unhelpful.  The store is always dirty and the shelves are empty.  The only thing that is disappointing is that the cashiers are always busy.  The cashiers are not friendly and don't seem to know the difference between a CVS and Rite Aid.  One star because I just went there with my dog and it was on my way home from work.

Food,3.0,OR,"I was just there and ordered an iced coffee. I always use honey as a sweetener and asked that they add a little hot coffee to the honey while making my ice coffee so the honey mixes better with the cold coffee. Apparently this is a very difficult task because when I picked up my coffee there was a big clump of honey at the bottom. The girl at the window said they would remake it but was so rude, I was embarrassed for Starbucks. I received my coffee but it tastes rancid. I drink Starbucks 5-6x a week and order my coffee the same way every time so I know how it should taste. It's obvious they did something to my coffee, and they were all laughing while re-making it. What a shame. The people working at this place are a joke. Bad rep Starbucks."
Food,4.5,OR,"A bakery visit should always be a special and sweet part of your day!  Upon entering, there is a large cozy and worn couch on the left, little tables, wall and ceiling decor. The decor, I felt it, gave the place a whimsical vibe.  The staff at Whisk were really welcoming and helpful. We got a ""healthy cookie"" , (chocolatey oats and dense) a lemon curd pop tartlet (soft, sweet, with just the right tang), Rice Krispie ( so big and made with brown butter!) and we also got a sample of their take of the Tagalong cookie from a Girl Scout event they did and that was the sweet cherry on top. Everything was delicious and fresh! There were not many coffee options, but whisk is a bakery, not a coffee shop. Def would come back. Thanks for calming my sweet tooth :)"
Food,3.5,OR,"I have been a Starbucks fan for many years. I still enjoy their food and coffee, but I just can't figure out why a cup of coffee takes so damn long...I have been to this location 5 times now and every time I've had to wait an inordinate amount of time for my coffee....  and if you go in the drive-through, you're STUCK..and usually for 15mins..  The last time I went in with my kids we each ordered a drink and it rook 8.5 minutes (my son timed it) to get all of our drinks out.  I'd understand if it were busy, but there was no one in front of us...

Their sandwiches are decent, but typically a bit rubbery after their microwave/heat blaster machine, and there's no salt or pepper to put on them (?), but I'll still order some because it's convenient."
Food,5.0,OR,"One of the best places to get a snowball if not the best.  The staff is always friendly and the service much better than Plum street.  Not the mention the snowballs are so much better!  But, most importantly they NEVER skimp on the syrup.
Tons of flavors, stuffed snowballs, shakes, malts, and soft serve, oh and plenty of diet flavor choices also.  I think they also have stuffed artichokes and tamales.
My personal absolute fave, is coconut with condensed milk!

I've been enjoying these deliciously snowballs for over 25 years now and they've only gotten better.  I'm such a fan of this place I bought a t-shirt, which I proudly sport.

Worth a trip to Harahan, or if you're in the hood worth stopping by.  I think April - Halloween(def).

One last thing, Very affordable treat as opposed to any of the ice cream parlors."
Food,4.0,OR,"Wine Works has a huge selection of wines to choose from.  They also have extremely helpful associates.  Great customer service.

Few things to note - in the front of the store, there is a tasting section.  There is a small fee for a lifetime membership ($10 I think), but it's worth it.  You can taste both red and white wines before you buy.  Try something new, etc.  Also up there, there is a wonderful selection of cheeses.  You can find a cheese to go with any wine you purchase and there is typically someone working in that area who can recommend a cheese if you're not sure.  Also, there is often a cheese or two out with the wine tasting.  Lastly, if you shop at ShopRite, your receipt will often print a coupon on the back for WineWorks."
Food,3.5,OR,"I walk in and a guy (one of the neighborhood bums) was standing in front of the chicken like it's gold...I asked the guy why he was standing in front of the food...then the bum guy said he works there...then the owner said the guy was standing in front of the food for security so that no one would grab food and run out...odd....

I didn't buy anything because the place smells like gasoline and frying oil that is never changed. I was concerned that the chicken would taste like the smell of the gas station. This place made me feel very uncomfortable. I decided to take a pass.

I should not have walked into this place anyway...on the outside it looks nasty dirty and contaminated......

Maybe they are selling something other than what they advertise in that gas station.

I should have never stepped into that nasty place. Geez."

Food,4.0,OR,"Yes! Finally coaxed friends to join me in the pseudo-long trek to Franklin Fountain for some pure, childlike indulgence.

What a classic place! Things you will find: microbrewed sodas, candy cigarettes, ""paper money only"" and white-suited scoopers. Our four eager palates split a Mt. Vesuvius Sundae (yes, it's as gloriously majestic as it sounds) - substituting plain old vanilla for hydrox (aka cookies and cream) and mint chocolate chip.

Oh. My. God. My mouth actually waters each time I glance at the photo I took of this masterpiece: A shiny metal bowl packed with a pint of creamy dairy deliciousness, drenched in hot fudge, surrounded by rich chocolate brownies, and sparkling with graham cracker dusting.

A cute little Asian man actually asked to take a photo. Of the sundae.  Not the four girls encircling it, all enraptured by the dazzling mound of frozen delight innocently lying at their mercy."
Food,4.0,OR,"Its a hip location with plenty of singles who meet and set up dates. Oh God, I used hip in a review, I hate myself for doing it. 

There is always a great conversation and lots of chances to sit outside and watch SoHo go by the cafe. 

There are couple of down sides to this one specifically:

When you get here, if you plan to work, bring a power strip. There are never enough outlets and this place is busy. 

Its a better location to work where you can tolerate noise, because there is always, ""That guy"" who talks too loud about something not worth talking about, or a ""so cute"" kid who like to run around your chair while his mother looks on while he disturbs you. 

Nice outdoor area, but mind your stuff there are a few homeless folks who sometimes scope out unattended items."
Food,3.5,OR,"Oh, Danny and Clydes, how I miss thee.

They FINALLY rebuilt in this spot, last year, after Hurricane Katrina killed the other gas station/convenience store that was here.

I love how shiny and new it is and the gas pumps actually work!  The gas is super cheap, because they are competing with the Race Trac on Lafayette (they are always the same price or 1 cent less).

The inside is nice, clean and big and they have a great selection of beer and snacks.  A good crowd goes in here, too.  I actually feel safe going here at night to fill up.

I admit that, yes, I have gotten chicken from Brothers.  It's cheap and good.  No, it's not Popeyes, and it can't compare to what Danny and Clydes once offered, but I'll take what I can get.  

Thank you for rebuilding in this spot!!"

This little Italian gem is tucked away in the corner of Hyde Park Village. If you don't look good you may miss it!  It's opposite the fountain in the middle. I believe it's the best italian bakery in Tampa! 

This bakery has a good assortment of fresh baked Itallian cookies, cakes, coffees, but my absolute favorites are the pignoli cookies!!  They are not to be missed!!  

Their original location is located in Newport Richey which my husband and I have been to.  They do all their baking at that location. They also sell delicious breads at the Newport Richey location, but unfortunately, not at the Tampa location.   Please bring your delicious breads to Tampa too!! 

The young gentleman that served us was helpful and friendly."

Traditionally, my hubs go to is KOLSCH (4/5). Their Kolsch was close to how they make it in Germany - fresh, not heavy and milder with crisp notes, which is why my hubs loves it!

I loved my IMPERIAL STOUT (5/5) - Enjoyed the dark chocolate/espresso flavors (really beautiful colors) w/perfect amount of sweetness.

They have a permanent food stall in the beer garden area - equipped with jenga and cornhole - wished they had more games since it's a popular brewery & everyone was occupying all the games. Parking is a tiny area - park next door where other businesses are closed. The woodwork is an added bonus - Yelp them out & see it with your own eyes!"
Food,3.5,OR,"This target is a zoo most of the times that I've been here.  It's located in one of the busiest parts of Tampa, so I'm sure that's most of the reason.  
Amidst the chaos and the confusion, this store still remains one of my favorites.  
The checkout registers are tended to well, and I don't ever have to wait too long to pay.  
The shelves and racks are always stocked and organized.  Even though it's a smaller store than other Bay area Targets, it's still kept clean and well organized.  
The Starbucks cafe inside is also a nice additionally feature.  
My only complaint is the parking lot in the garage.  I wish there was additional lighting available under the garage.  It can be a little daunting as a mom with her children in this dimly lit parking lot."

Food,4.0,OR,"Stopped by on a Saturday evening to try out the new Newtown Brewing. Within the nine or so beers they had on tap, there was a pretty good variety. We had to flights (of four) to try the ones that looked good. We enjoyed the white IPA, witbeer, NE IPA, and the lemon basil saison a lot! We also tried the cider, pale ale, and blonde, which were also good. There's an imperial IPA and a kolsch on deck, which I'd love to go back and try.

There's table seating, bar seating, bar standing, and even a back room for parties (which was open to the public as there were no parties today). There were some kids running around by the bar on a Saturday night, which was strange. Otherwise, a great place to grab a brew. I'm sure we'll be back again after they rotate a few more."
Food,4.5,OR,"I do most of my grocery shopping here.  Most of the produce is grown on the farm (although they do have items from elsewhere, but they are always clearly marked), and it is pesticide-free.  They also have a lot of organic grocery items (oils, vinegars, canned beans and sauces, spices, crackers, etc.) and they have baked goods, which are made on premises.  I especially love to buy my eggs there, because the very chickens who lay them are right outside, and you can see how well they are taken care of and what they eat.  Sure, it may cost a little more than a supermarket, but it makes more sense to me to spend the money to buy wholesome REAL food that is grown locally and without pesticides,  rather than food that's been flown in from South America or produced in a factory."
Food,3.5,OR,"I've heard so many things about how great Rastelli's is that I was wondering if I was the only person not in awe over their new store in Marlton. Thankfully, I'm not. That would have been awkward. 

Don't get me wrong -- it's a beautiful store, full of shiny new cases displaying gorgeous food handled by happy people. It reminded me of Zagara's, but more modern with less of a selection. 

The store is confusing, though -- it's somewhere between a specialty market and a mainstream market with a ridiculous mark-up. Almost $5 for a box of Chex cereal -- seriously? Gluten-free items that cost $7.99 at Rasteli are $4.99 at Target. 

The bakery was beautiful, as was the produce section and sandwich counter. The other departments, including a food court'ish type set-up, were beautiful and tempting. Some prices didn't seem bad, while others seemed a little steep."
Food,3.0,OR,"I loved this store when they first opened, but I'm becoming disenchanted as time goes on. I was there yesterday and encountered 3 main problems.
1. There were not enough cashiers open.
2. My points did not go on. I had to go to customer service to have them put on. This was a waste of my time since I now  had  to  wait in a second line. 
3.The cashier was not knowledgeable enough to explain why I was not getting the points I was supposed to get.

The aisles are spacious The selections are good. I especially like their organic and non dairy selection. I like the store. It is closer to home, but I may continue to make the longer drive to Whole Foods. The regular prices are not any better and I do not wish to base my food choices by what is on sale."
Food,4.0,OR,"Finally made it out here to check things out. I have to admit that I was a little let down that prices weren't noticeably lower than places in Center City. That said, given the Philadelphia area mark up and the beer situation in Pennsylvania, they were not horrendous.

Selection is good, though to be honest, I think some places in Center City may be about as good (Monde Market, Food and Friends, even you, Corner Foodery).

The staff seemed friendly and I like the idea of having tables where you can just chill out.

Here's what $21.48 bought me (each was a 12 oz. bottle):

Ballast Point - Grapefruit Sculpin (I had been looking all over for this!)

Most important, I buy ALL my coffee in bulk.  It's usually $10-11/lb, but it's so good that I prefer to make my coffee at home over buying it at Starbucks.

Food,4.5,OR,"Didn't really want to leave a review as I went in and didn't end up ordering anything, but upon reading the other reviews I felt like this needed to be mentioned...

In my opinion, the reason that everyone is raving about their children loving this place and the low prices is because the smoothies (almost?) all have sherbet, sorbet, or frozen yogurt in them! Aka a bunch of (cheap) added sugar.

Most healthy smoothie places charge more and aren't as sweet because they are mostly comprised of actual fruit. This place is more of a dessert and juice place. 

If I wanted a juice, sure, they seem to have some decent options with seemingly ""clean"" ingredients. But I wanted a smoothie and none of them seemed to be vegan, let alone healthy at all. 

Not saying to boycott this place, just a reminder to read ingredients in what you are consuming..."
Food,4.0,OR,"Located in the former Starbucks Store, Nekter focuses on healthier concoctions. We tried the ""Skoop Chocolate Bliss"". This is a healthier version of ice cream -- zero saturated fat, so your preachy doctor will be pleased. It's made from cashew ""milk"" which is not really cow's milk at all, two different sugars, and cocoa. They also have a coconut version. The chocolate Bliss we had was excellent. A good-sized scoop is $4. 25. Of course, there is much more to try on the overhead menu. It's a cheerful little place with eager employees who are careful to wear latex gloves. Blenders make a bit too much noise when operating, but there is also seating outside for the overly sensitive who can't stand a couple minutes while a beverage is blended. The cocoa adds a little caffeine, so lovers of the former Starbucks won't be too disappointed in its replacement."
Food,4.0,OR,"This place is amazing.  The true sign of really great ice cream parlor = 3 visits within 2 weeks and 5 lbs heavier, and I still want to go back.  asap.  

I admit, the sundaes here are pricey - $10 for their signature sundaes.  BUT, you probably won't be able to finish this in one sitting alone.  So, you'll need to share.  Or, like me, you could eat half and save the other half for later.  Because with Franklin Fountain ice creams, you can!  I put whatever I can't finish in the freezer and eat it for later (sometimes a week later!).  And unlike some ice creams that will have a layer of watery ice when refrozen, these taste as good as new! :)

The only downside can be the drive thru line - not the service - the customers, and maybe the person that designed the parking lot. The cars always end up blocking the road with a long line into the drive thru during peak times. No fault of the staff - these are the folks heading into the offices that are in the Intech Park area with morning rush and group coffee orders. During these peak morning rush times I avoid the drive thru and order inside."
Food,3.5,OR,"Based on reading other reviews, I think I may have just hit Jacks on an ""off day"". Walking into Jacks, the atmosphere was less than friendly as the woman behind the counter was busy restocking doughnuts and didn't acknowledge a soul that walked through the door. After several folks awkwardly stood around for several minutes, we were all quite unclear how to order or who to order from. Eventually the woman behind the counter told us to tell us her order and she would remember it. Needless to say, after telling her our order in the midst of her running around behind the counter, she did no in fact remember the order and we had to start the whole process over again. We felt like more of an annoyance than a customer in our visit to Jacks. The doughnuts were good, but overshadowed by the uncomfortable customer service experience."
Food,4.5,CG,"In town for a soccer game. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The owner, ""Jennifer"" is extremely rude. She is rude and takes the time to make sure customers are taken care of. This is why I am giving this place 4 stars. I have never seen such poor customer service. I don't think I will ever go back. This is the best beer store in the area. I have a hard time finding anything that I like here. It's the perfect place to get a beer for a dinner party. Their beer is super tasty and reasonably priced. They have some of the best beer in the area. They have a ton of different options to choose from."

I had the banana, which was very good. It had a strong banana flavor with a hint of banana in it.  The banana was sweet and creamy.  The staff was very nice. 

I did get a free scoop of the strawberry ice cream which was very good.  I liked the flavor of the strawberry.  I like that they have a separate section for toppings to choose from.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  I was looking for a couple of ice cream flavors that I didn't like and they had some.  I'll be back for sure.This place is my favorite coffee shop"

I will admit that I have been a frequent customer of this pharmacy for years, but since then, I have had a very poor experience with the staff. It was very unprofessional and unprofessional.

Food,1.5,OR,"Went shopping here on the weekend bought a few groceries including a few items marked down down with 50% stickers.  The clerk missed these stickers and charged me full price for these items. I noticed the price difference when I got home so I called and asked the customer service person what I should do she said ""circle the items on the receipt and bring it in"". I asked if I need to bring the items back and she said ""no it's ok"". Went back the next day with the receipt and the customer service person said I needed to bring the items as well.  So had to go home and get the items. So really any money I would of saved I lost on gas. If the staff did their jobs properly or were trained correctly issues like this wouldn't happen and make long time customers frustrated."
Food,4.0,OR,"Came here when we had a short trip to Philadelphia. And just as other reviewers have written... Ice cream is fantastic (and I am an ice cream connoisseur). The staff is amazingly friendly and happy. My daughter has a tree nut allergy and they actually cleaned a scoop with a special cleaning solution made by crushing and adding a ""pellet"" of a special cleansing solution in water and placing it in a metal milkshake cup. They used that clean scoop and took her serving of ice cream from a brand new tub of ice cream! That is just fantastic customer service. The establishment is charming and very fun. We hit the place just right and there was a relatively short line. We waited maybe 5 minutes. Shortly after we came, the line doubled in size. We will definitely make it a point to go back anytime we return to Philly!!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I absolutely love this place. Super cool vibe and great drinks always. My only gripe is that It allows children. I appreciate that it's family friendly, but it's legitimately a playground some nights. With adults getting pelted with stray balls thrown by rowdier kids, getting ran into, and getting drinks spilled. I wasn't even affected but if you sit and watch you can just watch the chaos. At the end of the day this is a brewery, not a playground. Get a damn baby sitter and then come out. Honestly I don't mind kids but seeing these parents encourage their kids to run around and bump into adults trying to have a night out is absolutely ridiculous. And they'll probably never change this policy because the shitty parents would riot but it's annoying as hell. Could be an awesome place without.  I'll still come. Just probably during school hours."
Food,4.0,OR,"WOW! This ice cream/frozen yogurt joint is one-of-a-kind. They offer self-service frozen yogurt, rolled ice cream, bubble tea, and endless other options. I got the Blown 2 Pieces rolled ice cream and it was so good and filling. I was only able to eat 2 out of the 3 rolls. The staff was very patient with us, as we had many, many questions. However, they were in the process of training a new staff member on how to make the rolled ice cream so it took a lot longer than it should have. My sister got the bubble tea and she had it gone in less than 2 minutes, so I'm assuming she must have liked it a lot. I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try the bubble tea and other ice cream flavors. This should be the first ice cream option on everyone's summer go-to list!"
Food,5.0,OR,"Great beards + great coffee! Ginger Beard Coffee is a unique Tampa coffee shop experience and can't be missed. Derek and Josh are the friendliest and most entertaining baristas I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Plus those BEARDS! You won't get that at Starbucks. They are knowledgeable on their delicious (and STRONG) nitro coffee but they also offer plenty of hot coffee and espresso for simple folks like me. Recently they've added kombucha on tap as well which is great if you aren't feeling the need for 3x the caffeine of a regular cup of coffee, which is what you will find in the nitro coffee. I go to Ginger Beard every Saturday morning after running and my experience is always top-notch. I recommend to anyone and everyone, especially those wanting to support a small local business where you can chat with and get to know the owners personally."
Food,3.5,OR,"If the apocalypse comes, don't bother coming here. Not much on the shelves anyway. I was in desperate need of glass noodles for a soup I was making and popped in here, thinking I could also pick up bok choy and a couple of other items I needed. Well, I found the glass noodles and the bok choy, but not much else. Part of this cavernous warehouse is used as a wholesaler (nice kitty cat roaming in the office, by the way), and the other half looks like a storage space for things purchased at Chinese restaurants that may have shut down. Very strange.  I ended up at 168 Market a few minutes later and recognized at least 3 other ""refugees"" who had been here, couldn't find what they needed, and so went to another market to find the rest of the things.

We all nodded to each other conspiratorially."

The tea was delicious. I would give it four stars as the flavor was bright and light. The popping pearls added dimension to the drink. They were currently out of boba which was my first choice. 

The donuts were delightful. We got a buttermilk donut. It's thicker than most and had more of a muffin consistency. The taste was fantastic and had a cake like flavor. We also tried a cinnamon sugar donut. The batter tasted flavorful but was very flaky. We wouldn't get it again due to having to wipe off every three seconds. 

Looking forward to going again!"

Super pleased to find an array of breakfast sausages for $3.59/lb (excepting the beef breakfast sausages which were $4.59/lb).  Turkey sage is the bomb.

I generally buy my meat grass fed/organic but it's difficult to find turkey/pork that ways, especially breakfast sausage.  And forget about it being a price I can afford.  I do have affordable sources for grass-fed beef and organic chicken but in a pinch, Martin's is a great source, it looked very, very fresh, maybe $3-4/lb ground beef.  Def stock up on their specials (I got 3lb roasted red pepper sausage for $10)."

I came here and asked for an iced latte with non dairy milk. The first sign that things were going awry was when they owner of this institution amidst blaring country music (Chattahoochee) emerged from the back with what seemed to be a 10 oz paper cup (with the 90s swish pattern) filled to the top with ice. One poorly packed shot was drawn and almond milk was steamed for a fraction of a second then poured with the shot over ice. The result: what appeared to be a mid-nineties milkshake latte. The espresso was burnt, and the milk tasted buttery. For just under $6 this was not adequate. Feel free to support this local business but it doesn't deserve 1 star."

Food,4.5,OR,"Good, but not great farmer's market. 

Be it riding your bike or driving your car, parking close to the market is a bear. The market is hidden behind BR High School, so space feels limited and squashed. 

Rest assured, you can get whatever you're searching for: a limited selection of organic fruits and veggie, specific cuts of pork and beef, kimchee, BBQ sandwiches, baked goods (bread, danish, muffins, croissants) from local bakeries that are often GF/Vegan, wild flowers, crepes, coffee, iced drinks, popsicles, herbs, teas.

I dunno. So much of the goods at this market appear to be processed foods -- I'd love to see more fruits  and veggies offered in a less congested space. 

Right now, the Carmel Farmer's Market by the Palladium is our top choice. It's extremely well laid out, has a designated area to park your bike, and has far more fruit/veg options.

The shop was clean and bright and not crowded - although it was 11am on a January Friday morning.

She ran into the store behind me when she saw me enter the store and DID NOT wash her hands.  She came right from smoking a cigarette to serving the food which is DISGUSTING!

She also was unprofessional in her demeanor and looked like she just rolled out of bed.

I find it hard to stay within budget when shopping at Parti-Pak. I'm slowly perusing the shelves...then gasp...a Mikkelller, Stillwater or Prairie ale I haven't seen before! I wants it, I needs it...must have the precious! There is almost an entire aisle of Belgium and French ales only, if you're into imports. Parti-Pak also allows you to customize 6-packs out almost anything you want, so you get to explore more beers than you typically would. They also have Underberg near the check-out counter, another perk in my book. 

Ignore the worn exterior/interior and deceiving name; visit Parti-Pak, prepare to squeal with delight, and spend more than you intended. Your inner craft beer aficionado will forever thank you."

There is no WiFi for those of you who would prefer to bring your own laptops.  However, the owner mentioned to me that a laptop could be patched in to the cable connection, although I do not know if there is a cost for that or not.

Food,4.5,CG,"This is one of my favorite bars in the area. I always come here for the chill vibe. It's not the best place for a good beer, but it's great for a nice place to hang out with friends. I've been here for years and always enjoy the vibe. I love the name and the vibe. I also love the fact that they have a food truck outside. I always get the same thing every time I go. It's like a good day for me. The only downside is they have a small parking lot. It's not always the case. I've been here a couple times and they have been kind of slow. It's a bit of a drive and it's a bit of a drive for me."
Food,3.0,CG,"Thought I'd stop by here once a week. It's a little on the pricier side, but worth it. 

The ice cream is pretty good, and the prices are pretty reasonable. I got the peanut butter flavor, which is a chocolate with fudge. The staff is friendly, and the line is out the door. 

They also have a really great selection of frozen yogurt, as well as a few toppings. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the area. You're sure to find something you like. 

I'm a sucker for their chocolate ice cream, so I was happy to try out the other flavors. They were all pretty good, and I think the ""fudge"" part was"
Food,3.0,CG,"Bevmo! is simply as good as it gets. I love that they have a full sized selection of cupcakes and cakes, both of which are extremely tasty. They also have gluten free and vegan cupcakes. I also enjoy the variety of flavors offered. The texture of the cake is unique, and it's a great way to bring back a friend or family. I love that they have a variety of cupcakes. I also love the fact that they have vegan cupcakes. I usually order a vegan cupcake for my kids (which is a great option for a date night dessert). They also have vegan cupcakes. There is a ton of seating and the space is small."
Food,5.0,CG,"I just stopped by Dan's last week and bought a bottle of the Gose, which was awesome.

I had the Cherry Apple.  The flavor was not overwhelming at all, but it was a little too much for me.  I wish I had tried it.

They had a decent selection of wines and beers, but the majority of the wines were so overpriced.  I went with the Red Velvet, and it tasted like it had a good flavor.  The Red Velvet was also very dry, and I would have loved to try it again.

I enjoyed the cherry wine.  I really liked the lemon wine, but I don't know how they make it.  The red Velvet was okay, but not the best."
Food,4.0,CG,"A friend and I on a weekday and the line was out the door! So we went inside. We waited in the open front, and they said the wait was to take. We were lucky to get our drinks in a timely manner. There are a few tables inside and outside for people to sit. The line was to the back, but we ordered on the app and got our drinks quickly. The barista seemed to be happy to answer our questions and gave us a few extra options for our drinks. It's a little pricey, but I'm not sure why. I was looking for a nice little coffee shop in downtown SB, and it was not my first choice. I'll be back for sure!This place is my favorite coffee place in the area."
Food,2.5,OR,"Meat department. They always run out of the advertised special and today is no different. They have had all night to restock, but of course there is none of the special. I was able to get the butcher to answer the bell and let him know the situation, but instead of promptly resolving the problem, he's walking the department with a clipboard taking inventory. It's been about 15 minutes that I've been standing and waiting for him to finish. The other issue is that they are substituting an inferior product for what was advertised. They advertised boneless product and using a bone-in product as a substitute.

I've shopped at the store since it opened as it is convenient to my home. However I find myself coming here less and less as their prices go up, the quality of their product goes down (don't get me started on the produce) and their customer service becomes nonexistent."
Food,4.5,OR,"I LOVE this grocery store! Great selection. Good range of organic items, and I can buy pre-made dinners with no preservatives to just come home and heat up. 

Starbucks in the store, which I love. They also have a full service restaurant which I don't really recommend, but they do have table and chairs where you can sit and eat if you'd like. 

The best part--you can choose your produce and meat, then take it to the deli area and they'll chop it/cook it however you like. So they'll brown your ground beef, boil your chicken, etc. Free of cost! Makes preparing dinner so much easier. 

The cashier lines move really quickly. They always have a ton of registers open, and they have this machine that tells you which register to go to, which keeps things moving. 

Great liquor selection. (Really, it's a whole liquor store inside the store.) lovely bakery with beautiful desserts."
Food,2.5,OR,"I still go here because it's easy, but this has to be one of the more poorly managed Walgreens you'll find.  Half the time I come here I end up buying something that was on sale and I didn't even know it because there's no signage.  Isn't that the point of a sale?  You tell people it's priced lower and they buy more?  Instead, I'm willing to pay full price but then they discount the item(s) at the register... don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to pay less but if I knew it was on sale I might have bought more items or more of the same item.  That's just bad business and whoever manages this store clearly doesn't appear to be doing their job very well - plus the guy who's often outside begging for money makes me feel a little strange at times.  Just sayin."
Food,4.0,OR,"Love love love boba tea and this cutie little place! 

Definitely visit 1, 2, Tea for a place to hang and get yummy drinks or just grab a drink to go for the day as a treat! 

This place is the cutest! Their decorations and the ambience just make me happy and I wish this place is my place sometimes. 

I have tried many drinks from here and I like all of the ones I've tried so far. I don't really have a go to drink here because it depends on what I'm in the mood for when I crave boba. Oh and their hot teas are great for a cold and gloomy day as well. 

The service is good and simple. Plus, they have lunch cards so you can get a freer drink after 10 drinks. 

I recommend this place so go there next time you are in the mood for boba tea!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I always enjoy my time at Perennial. The staff is all super friendly especially Emily who always has a smile on and good conversation to share. Tonight we biked in mostly for food but had some beers as well. We had the carnitas (pictured), the panzanella salad and the devilled eggs. I had the Owen a slightly sour favorite of mine and a Masterfade which was a really nice medium IPA. Then I had a small pour of La Boheme- an aged sour (pictured). My fiancee had the intentially indulgent which was a big dark beer but very smooth and followed that up with a nice easy drinking vacation dad(pictured). When I asked about other beers they were nice enough to describe them for me and give me a small taste which I always appreciate because it is the best way to know how you will like it. Always a great time at Perennial!"
Food,4.0,CG,"I must may I have been caught by the long line of people who come in the store, but I guess it's a good thing. The staff was friendly and the store was clean. I'll be back. I would come back to this location for the coffee. I have to say it's a great place to meet up with friends and chat. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a break from the usual New Orleans coffee shops. The service is quick and friendly. They also have a great selection of pastries and pastries. I haven't had a pastry here before, but I will for sure be back for more. This place is my favorite coffee place in the area."
Food,5.0,CG,Kayuh has been my favorite brewery in the area.  I always love that they have local beers.  There's always a food truck out front and the brewery has a great food truck that is always a great place to hang out.  There are also some food trucks and they have a great food truck outside for those who are hungry.  There's a food truck outside if you want to bring something.  I love the atmosphere and the location.  It's very dog friendly and it's a great place to hang out.  I love that they have a parking lot in front and it's a great place to come hang out with friends.  I love the beer and the location.  The staff is always friendly and happy to answer any questions. 
Food,4.0,CG,"There's really not too much room for the space, which is a nice bonus for the local breweries. I had the Chicken wings and the Chocolate Cracker, both of which were delicious. The only complaint is that the beer was on the cold side and I wasn't able to taste the BBQ. I was hoping to try it, but I didn't see any food options. Overall, I liked the beer, but the service was slow and a little slow. I would come back to try something else, but I would probably stick with my local breweries. I'll probably stick with their other beers. I have been going here for over 10 years and it is the best location ever. The staff is always friendly and the ice cream is excellent."
Food,4.5,CG,"Here's my original review: I've had the pleasure of using this location as my go-to store.

I had a coupon for a free mini-dessert cake for my daughter's birthday. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the young man working the counter. He was a bit rude, but the cake was amazing. The cake was moist and buttery. The icing was perfect, with the perfect amount of frosting. I'd definitely recommend this bakery for cakes!I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to Boise. I was just in town and needed some coffee. I had a friend visiting from out of town and found this coffee shop. I had the latte and I had the coffee. It was excellent."

Food,4.0,CG,Decided to try this brewing company. The space is very small but they have a small upstairs and downstairs area. The beers are very good. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. They had a few beers on tap which was a nice touch. The food was good. I had a chicken and a sandwich and it was good. The beer was very good. I also got a cheese plate. The cheese plate was pretty good. The pretzel was good. The service was slow. I would go back but I would probably go out of my way to go to the other brewery in town.This is my favorite location! The staff is always so friendly and helpful. The location is right on the corner of the State Street and is close to my house
Food,3.5,OR,"First time here.
Looks great walking in. Clean, fruits and veggies look great. Walked around to get my bearings. Came across a customer asking an employee if they had more cucumbers. He said he didn't work produce, but he would check. I happened to see a giant box and loose ones (3 for a dollar) in the inside door when you walk in, with tomatoes and avocados. So, I told her. 
Stood at deli counter for about 10 minutes while the deli person was on the phone (she did see me, and said nothing).
Walked away.
They have shelves stocked nicely. 
Got in line, and boy oh boy.... slowness ensued.
Also, as with most Rouses, they don't know how to bag.
No, I don't want my salad on top of my hot food.
Nor the raw chicken in with other stuff. 
Don't want the sharp corners of my soymilk in a single bag with a couple of OJ bottles (it ripped)."
Food,1.5,OR,"If I could give a lower rating, I would. This location's pharmacy department is staffed with incompetent technicians. My prescription was electronically sent in by my doctors office. I went directly to pick it up (about 30 minutes). The technician did not know how to lookup an electronic prescription, so I we sent to ""consultation"". Another line. Then I was told it was ""ready to be printed"" and to come back in an hour.  I did so, and was told it was still not ready, and to return in 30 minutes.  Several other technicians were present on both occasions, and the workload could still not be handled effectively. The pharmacist was obviously overworked. CVS really needs to rethink how their pharmacy department here is managed and needs to either better train their people or more thoroughly screen their applicants.  They have lost my business after this travesty of an experience is over."
Food,3.5,OR,"This Target is a mediocre. Any time I enter it I get sucked into the abyss of their clothing selection, which is why I keep going back. Due to convenience to my apartment, I used to routinely shop for groceries at this location. During multiple instances they were out of items that I wanted. Basic things, like bread. The final straw was when I went to buy the Fage yogurt and every yogurt was many days past it's sell-by date. I understand that the sell-by date is really a suggestion, but this is a Target charging a premium price for food. Disappointing. Also, after starting to shop at Aldi, there is no way I'd be willing to pay Target prices again.
Generally, coming to this location is not enjoyable. It's always way crowded, lines are long, and people seem to be especially bad about not leaving their carts in the middle of the aisles like jerks."
Food,4.5,OR,"I've visited this brewery a few times now, mostly for their anniversary parties which happen around the end of Philly Beer Week. During these events, even with the huge number of attendees guzzling delicious brews, everything ran smoothly because of the NCBC team's preparations. Different styles of beer were being poured in different sections of their fairly enormous warehouse space, making lines efficient and allowing for customers to take a self-guided tour of the premises. 

Along with the anniversary party, they do other special events, and regularly show sporting events (especially soccer/football). They always have a food truck on hand for a bite to eat, and the brewery's tasting room has all kinds of arcade games. 

Aside from their delicious hoppy and barrel-aged beers (not to mention other interesting styles they dabble with), the guys who run this brewery are stand up dudes and they are growing a great local small business in Bucks County."
Food,2.0,OR,"Very friendly staff that works efficiently. The problem here is I've gotten multiple drinks here with spoiled cream to a point I messaged sent feedback about it so they can be aware to be more careful. Manager denied they had any problems and offered a gift card as a token of an apology. I responded just trying to explain that there was a problem and was ignored and was never sent the gift card. When I responded and even asked for the manager at the physical store just to talk about it, he refused to talk to me about it. I didn't visit this location for a couple weeks due to this and recently went and had the same exact issue with spoiled cream and it shows that something they are doing is a problem. Only visit this location if you plan on buying food, not beverages because they are not handling the dairy properly."
Food,4.5,OR,"Not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said! 

When Pint Size first opened I had a good feeling about it. It looked cute, I love the concept of small batches, and who doesn't love sweets? 

The shop itself is pint size, I like how when you are at the counter ordering you can see how the kitchen works. They are always  busy in the back, which means more yummy treats for us!  My favorite sweet is the oatmeal sandwiches. I can't stop in and not leave without them. They are so good!  Buttercream filling mixed with marshmallow, yum!  I've tried the brookie sp? (brownie/cookie mix), muffins, and other various treats and I've never been disappointed.  

I haven't made it in on a Saturday morning for the salted croissants yet, but it is on my to do list. 

They also serve Kaldis coffee which is a major bonus."

Food,4.5,OR,"Did you even visit Santa Barbara if you didn't have a scoop of McConnell's ice cream? If it's your first time in town, please do yourself a favor and hit up SB's finest contribution to the ice cream world. This location is conveniently located in the Funk Zone, within a short distance from the train station, and a block away from the pier. Flavors here are great! I do have to say that I feel like they have less variety here compared to their other location up State street. But on a positive note, they do have seasonal flavors so they're always coming up with something new. My go-to flavors are whiskey & pecan praline, turkish coffee, and if I'm feeling dairy free- you can never go wrong with eureka lemon & marionberries. Limited seating at this location. I suggest you get your ice cream and walk out to the pier or beach & enjoy SB!"
Food,4.5,OR,"In my opinion, better than Ted Drews. Clementine's should be a part of the list of must eats in St. Louis. Clementine's has a lot of classic flavors like chocolate and vanilla but also very interesting flavors such as Lemon Poppyseed (nice) and Maple Bourbon (naughty - with alcohol).

I opted for the Thai Tea and Decadent Coffee in a waffle cone. Although it was pretty expensive ($7 for the whole thing), I thought it was pretty worth it. The Thai Tea had such a strong flavor that tastes exactly like any of the Thai tea you can get in Asia but just in ice cream form. The Decadent Coffee was also delicious with a coffee flavor that is not too overwhelming. Best of all, none of these flavors were too sweet and the waffle cone carried it all very nicely without falling a part.

Overall, a fantastic experience at Clementine's and I will definitely be heading back."
Food,4.0,OR,"When I received my first shipment, I had some doubts because the meals seemed really small. But after emailing them, Adam got in touch and asked me to at least try them before cancelling, and I was shocked that he was right. These meals are not only surprisingly filling, they're YUMMY. I'm a really good home cook, so I have a pretty high standard, and wow was I impressed. Not only that, but I was able to throw half the meals in the freezer for those days where you need something quick but you haven't planned ahead at all, and I think they reheat just as well from frozen! I only take off a star because they're pretty expensive so I can only order every other week, and tons of the meals revolve around chicken breast which I find dry and tasteless, but if you stick to the other meats I think you're in great hands."
Food,3.0,OR,"i opened this review like oh this will be an easy UP as i thought of my quick trip but actually the layout of this location is (can i cuss??!?!) ..it's enough to not go back actually. i've been inside this location at least 3x and the service, cleanliness, speed, and atmosphere were fine. 

during peak hours you can't even get into the parking lot because it's a narrow angled one-way drive around. there's not enough room inside of their parking lot to accommodate the waiting cars so they sit in the street causing a traffic jam. there's other traffic from the other businesses in the suite. it's the most frustrating thing. you can't even get inside of the lot to park to order inside or grab your pickup items.

The girl at the self check out was a bit rude and it was obvious she didn't care about her job. I don't understand why people would have to deal with this place so poorly. I will stick with the self check out at the other location. I just went there to pick up a few things.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes!

There's also a nice selection of pastries and pastries. I love the location of the cafe, and the coffee and pastries are also great. The interior is clean and modern, and the coffee is always excellent. I love that there is a counter with a table for people to sit and enjoy their coffees, so if you want to sit outside, there is a great patio outside, which is perfect for getting out of the heat. I definitely recommend Foundation Coffee Co. for some great coffee, and for a reason. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Philadelphia or Philadelphia."

Food,4.5,OR,"Wow. My mother used to shop here when we lived here back in the 80s, and when I was passing through this weekend and needed some tonic water, I stopped in for old time's sake. 

The old girl could really use a face-lift. (The Shop-n-Bag, not my mother.) It hasn't changed a bit in 20 years (wish I could say the same), down to the 30-foot 70s-script teal green sign on the front. 

Not a bad market, but a little small and really outclassed by the Whole Foods concept, as well as the actual stores, although the deli section was clean and fresh and there were a few little old ladies handing out samples. 

The cashiers are still local teenagers, all skinny, gum-chewing zit farmers, but they seemed to have fun with each other even if they weren't talking to the customers. 

Probably deserves two stars, but the giant teal-green sign is way worth an extra star."
Food,1.5,OR,"Coffee here is the same as all the other Dunkins in the area, and the baked goods are usually fresh and delicious. I do have a few favorite workers there who are always very sweet, but apparently management there is bad because my favorite people are now either quitting or transferring to the other Dunkin on Little and Troublecreek.

Anyways, my only complaints are that sometimes the service can be slow as they'll usually have only person behind the counter, and they definitely do not clean the lobby as often as they should. There are many times where I'll go and see a broom with a bunch of dust and trash nearby -- not pretty. Or the tables will have crumbs, etc. I haven't been to the bathrooms, so I don't know about that.

There is also no wi-fi here. (Most people would know that, I think, but I still see customers asking that question every now and then)."
Food,4.5,OR,"Visiting from the land of abundance of ""hipster"" coffee, the San Francisco Bay Area should get rid of all their Phillz Coffee shops and replace them with CREMA. That's how great this place is (unless you are from or have visited the Bay Area you know what I mean)

Location: There is plenty of parking. They have an outdoor patio facing the bridge and Nissan Stadium. It's open and even when crowded it doesn't feel suffocating. 

Service: super chill and friendly people behind the counter. They are quick but helpful. Even though there was a long line they worked  efficiently allowing the line to move fluidly. 

Coffee: I ordered the TNpride with almond milk and it was symphony of flavor. Delicious and creamy! Totally perfect! Hubby ordered the Cuban... One word YUM! Despite having condensed milk it was not overly sweet. 

Conclusion: Forget Starbucks when I visit Nashville this will be my official go to coffee shop!"

I waited for 30 minutes in line for my prescription. I was told it would take 45 minutes to fill the prescription. I was told I would be able to get my prescription in 30 minutes.

Food,4.0,OR,"I must recommend the toast with avocado, olive oil, lime juice and chili flakes. And for those of you like me they offer gluten free toast! It was so tasty and left me wanting another slice, but for $5 a slice I passed on seconds. 

I also had a green tea which was flavored wonderfully. The staff puts great attention into the drinks they make (my friend had a coffee) but the amount of time it took to prepare the tea and coffee left something to be desired. This isn't a stop in quick for a drink and leave kind of place. 

The worst part of my experience here was the a horrible noise coming from the coffee grinding machines (I think). We had to move from the cozy couch by the window (furthest from the machine) to the bar in the other room. The noise was seriously irritating and the shop could use more comfortable seating throughout."
Food,4.0,OR,"Had the opportunity to stop by Heritage Vineyards and Winery while visiting with my NJ and NY distributors. I own a winery in the Anderson Valley of Mendocino County, CA. I was truly  impressed with the very high quality of all of the wines that we tried. The stainless steel whites, especially the Chenin Blanc, are excellent. T make this a the reds are well balanced and structured. My favorites were the BDX and the Cab Franc, both truly exceptional wines.  We were treated to a winery tour with son Erik Heritage and met Bill and Penni Heritage. The tasting room is delightful and the staff is very knowledgeable and pleasant.  There is a great picnic area as well and walking tours of their orchards and vineyards make this a great family outing. A great place to stop and it is indicative of some of the truly exceptional wines that are being produced in NJ."
Food,4.0,OR,"I come here for various dairy-free products that can be difficult/impossible to locate elsewhere in Nashville (at least so far). Getting in and out of the store is a pain, and getting around the store once inside can be tough. I have vowed, and broken my vow, to quit coming to WF on Saturdays, as the aisles are crammed with folks, and more than once I've nearly plowed down an undermonitored toddler with my mini-cart. (Sorry, undermonitored toddlers. I know it's not your fault.) 
I tried going early today, around 9am, and it wasn't nearly as packed as usual. Parking was also much easier. This looks like the best bet for me, and anyone else who gets overwhelmed trying to navigate a crowd. 
I have the impression that this store is pretty small, but I have been spoiled by the WF flagship store in Austin. This one's fine -- just not as expansive as I'm used to seeing."
Food,4.0,OR,"I come here for the corsets and not much else. They have probably the best selection of corsets in shop that I have ever seen, and since I have left Reno, I haven't been able to find a comparable place. The staff is usually incredibly friendly and don't have a problem helping me in and out of various corsets in a row.

The quality of the corsets themselves vary and obviously, fluctuate by price. They are incredibly pricy, but that is what you get for being able to see and feel the corset before you buy it. 

My only complaint is the size distribution of the corsets that have recently been coming in. They have all been the same size, so finding an amazing design is crushed by having six copies of the same sized corset. In addition, they don't seem to receive new stock terribly often so if you visit frequently, there isn't a large amount of variation."
Food,2.5,OR,"I chose this Walgreens because I was being released from the hospital and TMC wanted to make sure my pain medicine was ready to dispense before cutting me lose. Walgreens at Grant and Swan told them it was ready and to come in. I then called my ride to pick me up at TMC and drove off toWalgreens. It's a 30 minute drive from home to TMC , another ten to load me in and get to Walgreens. The Rx wasn't ready. Wasn't ready another 45 minutes later. We walked out and are going to transfer the Rx to our local Osco. Walgreens was my only shot at getting the pain med while I had someone to drive my car. At least I can get free pickup at Osco. 
In all fairness it was thanksgiving and Walgreens was one of three pharmacies open that day. Lying to TMC and saying an Rx was ready for pickup I unforgivable."
Food,3.5,CG,"I had high tea with a sweetened milk tea. It was nice and refreshing. I ordered the rose boba milk tea. The boba is the perfect sweetness. The boba was very soft and chewy. The flavor was subtle. I would come back to try other drinks. I love this place! I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service. I've tried a few items and they have all been delicious. I love their cakes and cakes! They always look so good. I've never had any issues with the cakes either. Their cakes are always moist and delicious. They also have a lot of great baked goods. They also have some other items and cakes, but I've never had a bad one here."

The store is always clean and the staff is very friendly. I have had to use the restroom several times and it's always clean. I always get the same thing every time.

Also, I love the fact that it is a little pricier than other Targets. I have to say it is cheaper than other Targets I have been to. 

Overall, I love this location, but I'm not sure why I am giving them a 4 star rating.A must try if you're in the area. We were in town visiting and found this place and we're so glad we did. I got the caramel and vanilla"
Food,4.0,CG,"I know they are overpriced, but the quality and quality of the product is just the same. The other two employees are less than friendly.

I've been to several locations in the area and this one has the best customer service. I've tried a few items and they have all been delicious. I love their cakes and cakes! They're all made fresh. You can't go wrong with any of them. There's a variety of frosting options that you can choose from and some great options to choose from. I love that they have a separate shelf to take your order to when you order."
Food,4.0,CG,"Ok, gotta say I'm a huge fan of the ice cream. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is super chill. I got a vanilla ice cream with chocolate chip and it was so good. I'll definitely be back. I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I got a vanilla latte, which was very good. I wish I could have gotten a bigger size! I got a regular latte, which was a perfect size for me. I also got a shot of espresso, which was really nice. I got a coffee with oat milk and it was good. I really liked the coffee though. They have a lot of options, but I'd recommend going to a place like this if you're in the area."

I went to the store and was told by the manager that he couldn't do anything. I was told that I had to wait for my cake. I'm not sure why I was so embarrassed and went to another store.

Food,4.0,OR,"Very cool little winery/Florida tourist trinkets shop.  This winery sits along a walkway with a ton of tourist gift shops, so it's really easy to pass this spot up if you're not aware of the vino gems they have inside.  What I didn't personally know for a long time was that they make their own wine and sell it here.  And what makes it special is the variety of different fruits they use to do so.  Oranges, cherries, mangos, you name it and they probably got it.  I won't say it's the best place to get some wine, but I will say I always grab a bottle when I'm in Madeira.  I just wouldn't drive out there specifically for their wine.

I suggest their red sangria and the Blache, which is a Black Cherry wine.  It has a nice balance of sweet and dry, which works out perfect for me and the chica!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I can't believe I've been in Nashville 9 months and just tried this place. It's amazing. I tried a few flavor before deciding on the goat cheese with cherries and whiskey and pecans. The goat cheese was sweet and creamy with just a hint of goat cheese and the cherries were swirled in. I will dream about that flavor; there are no words that can describe the wonderfulness of this ice cream perhaps it is sweetened with unicorn tears. The whiskey and pecan wasn't as sweet but still the perfect texture and combination of flavors. 

I can't wait to go back and try some more. The flavors are unique and seasonal. They also have a good selection of sorbets and other treats. I saw oatmeal cream pies and swiss cake rolls in the case that I just might need next time. Also, they sell there wonderfulness by the pint to take home. This is not good for my diet."
Food,4.5,OR,"The boba gods have answered my call: more boba in the greater New Orleans area!! I'll start with my only negative first: they are out in Metairie so it's a little bit of a drive, but hella worth it. This place has been crazy busy since opening so I decided to sneak in for a mid-afternoon snack and wasn't disappointed. They have a lot of tasty sounding options, and seem to be more traditional than other boba shops in the area. I ordered the Okinawa pearl milk tea, 80% sweet. There is only one size, and it's very big which I like! I really enjoyed the rich flavor of the brown sugar, but wish I would have gotten it less sweet. You can adjust the sugar and ice levels to your liking, so keep that in mind when you order. I'll definitely be back and can't wait to try all the other flavors, especially the handmade taro milk tea!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I really like going to this coffee shop but it has its ups and downs. The upside is the people are friendly and there's lots of fund foods and coffee. Downside, the restroom stinks and you'd better check the creamer. This morning at 715 am, I went in to get my favorite cup of java. When I picked up the half and half container I noticed that it was almost empty. Initially I thought, it's sort of early to be almost gone but I put it in my coffee anyway. There were bubbles in my coffee but I ignored the signs. I tasted it, the coffee was not hot and it tasted funny but I drank it anyway, well most of it. Now I am paying for it. Today's lesson, never use the half empty cream from a coffee shop especially when they just opened. Again, I really like this coffee shop I won't ignore the signs next time."
Food,4.5,OR,"I actually think 3.5 is a bit more accurate, but I'm feeling generous today so I'll give a 4.

My wife tried their pastry stout  (I can't recall the proper name of it) and REALLY liked it.  She asked our server what made it a pastry stout, and he knew right off of the top of his head--kudos for knowing the product.

I chose a non alcoholic ginger beer and it was quite good.  I wanted an ice tea, but they apparently don't serve it.  Might be a nice touch to add something as simple as that to the menu, for those who might be designated drivers or just prefer a non alcoholic beverage.

I chose the pastrami reuben, and it was tasty, but it seemed like there wasn't much meat--it was mostly bread and toppings.  I'd gladly pay more for a heartier sandwich.

Those minor complaints aside, it was a solid experience and merits a return visit."
Food,4.0,OR,"Got a chance to visit the Waterline today.  Overall this is a cool new spot in the Funk zone with an old building being repurposed into something relevant.  Gotta say, the food at the Nook is top notch, even if the price to value ratio seems a little off.  Basically we had the chicken sausage with a side salad and truffle fries for $29!  Definitely a little expensive but honestly the food quality was pretty amazing.

In regards to lama dog, the service needs to be looked at.  We were there on a Saturday at noon and the staff could not have been less interested to engage with us or offer any direction on the beer list.  Definitely unimpressive.  It had the feeling  that the service at the bar was cold and rushed and they need to work on that.

Go for the food, grab a beer, but don't rush to get there."

My hubby and I love nothing more than a good wine and cheese night, but there are only two of us and while we would love to each cheese every day, we know it isn't the wisest choice.  In comes The Cheese Company - not only are they knowledgeable, but also patient  -- both with the time it takes us to select our cheeses and with our desire for teeny tiny hunks of cheese.  

Their cheese selection is great and they always give you a sample to help you make up your mind.  On top of that they have additional fixings all around the store to help create the perfect ambiance for your night in (or if you're lucky, night out with friends somewhere cozy!)."

Food,4.0,OR,"I stopped by the market on Saturday since I was early to the Jersey-centric wine festival going on down the road. When I first arrived, I walked through the produce section, stopping at the sugar plums, then the oranges, gazing, looking at the cheap prices, and continuing to walk.

I then meandered into the Amish bakery. Crap. Seemingly without me noticing, I was standing in the check out line, ordering a strawberry cream doughnut, and holding a pumpkin roll, blueberry bars, and strawberry crumb bread. But, please, let's focus on the fruit. Not the excessive sugar.

After walking through some more of the indoor market, I made my way back to my car, where I inhaled (not figuratively, I mean, they disappeared in record time) two of the blueberry bars.

Didn't stop by the flea market part, but there were plenty of vendors and it looked packed. One day, I'll return to check it out. And to buy more blueberry bars because, heaven."

We sat in a booth and waited for a while (like 10 min) before we realized no one was going to approach us so my boyfriend got up to order us some beers. We were drinking our beers and waited another 20 minutes unnoticed until we asked a girl if she worked there and if she could take our order. She happily agreed to even though she was 6 ft away from us the entire time sitting by the bar. Apparently the bar tender was done with her shift and the waitress hadn't started hers yet, and the waiter that was supposed to take care of us was nowhere in sight. It was a pretty awful experience, since we were both hungry and it wasn't even busy.  I doubt its normally like this but I will not be returning any time soon."

Episode 1  (Friday, 3:30 PM)

We dash down the street through the torrential rain, and burst through the door. The four or five zombies vacuously absorbed in their smart phones don't glance up.  Sky Bar is cavernous and gloomy, with monsoon action visible behind the open air counter.    

""What's that weird scratchy fuzzy noise?""  

""THAT's vinyl,"" my husband responds superciliously.

Oh.  I give a bro nod to the DJ with the Gandalf hat. 

I'm going to guess this is hipster paradise.  Sky Bar features large tables forcing patrons to mingle (i.e., sit next to each other and text), a large movie screen (Godzilla with Spanish subtitles), a disco ball and eclectic music.

Our Long Island ice teas are adequate.  No, I don't hate my liver.  

The space definitely has character, but not a character we want to hang out with.  So...we decide to take our chances in the storm."
Food,3.0,OR,"I have to agree that this Starbucks is slower than most, but the staff are friendly and they make your drink right, which I appreciate! The ambiance in here is a bit lacking due to the location- there are often shady folks lingering near the front during the day and often loud kids coming through once the bus lets out, making it not the ideal place to study or relax. It seems that the staff have to change the key code on the bathroom daily because of this to keep its use down to only paying customers, but it's still hard for them to keep up with stuff going on around a blind corner from the barista area. The station with milk, straws, etc is usually missing some things and the trash is often overflowing, but I can't say enough that I think the staff here works hard to keep it nice-- I just think they've been dealt some tricky cards."
Food,4.0,OR,"If you follow me you'll see that I have visited a few in this chain. This store seemed slightly different than the others. Maybe it was an off day. For starters both kiosks were down. Then I noticed that the number of staff members seemed fewer than most. 
But with these negatives came the positives. The staffers were busy. No one standing around. The one operating the cash register and getting orders out maintained a pleasant attitude and was even helpful in suggesting which one cookie might be the best that week (pineapple whip was a great suggestion). The wait time for getting the cookie was about the same as other stores. There was someone making sure the supply on hand was plentiful and freshly baked. And another person did there best keeping the store as spotless as they could. In all the workers made this a positive experience and if back in Boise needing a sugar high I will return."

I think the manager needs to take a lesson in customer service and be more careful about their customer service. It's very sad that this store is in such a bad location. I will never go back to this store. I hope this store will improve and maybe hire more employees.

When we went there was a private party in one of the rooms but if they weren't there the place would have been huge. We went on a Saturday evening and somehow got great seats on the couch! This is a distillery so it's of course featuring their product but man my drink was amazing. It was called a Mule but it was the most unique mule I've ever had.

The munchkins are one of my favorites items- not only can I get them in almost any quantity but there are at least 5 flavors including plain raised and jelly filled. (Why is it so hard to find plain raised donut holes?) I'm also super glad to see that Dunkin now has almond, coconut or oat milk for their coffee drinks.

Their bakery is a never-ending story of glorious awesomeness ready to be picked up and carried home. I might stop in for some olives from their olive bar or any variety of cheese from their amazing cheese section, and leave with a tiny fruit tart or giant cupcake to share with somebody I love. This place is always some sort of exotic flavor adventure land and I make sure to leave myself 10-15 minutes just to browse and enjoy as some new and wondrous thing is always sure to pop up.

Such was the case yesterday when I went straight to their outstanding meat & seafood counter to get 3 lbs of sirloin @ $9. 99 per lb and 5 oysters Rockefeller @ $1. 99 each. I've had the sirloin before, so I know how good it is. I cooked the oysters last night. All 5 fit in the bottom of my air fryer. I cooked them for 6 minutes @ 400F. They looked perfect -- golden and bubbly -- and an internal temperature check proved that they were cooked. They smelled great. And they tasted very bit as good ad they looked and smelled. I'm writing this review because of those oysters."

Needless to say,  I was greatly unimpressed. The ice cream is good,  but nothing special if you've had good ice cream. The prices though are insane. I expected something huge for the money and was concerned it would be too much. No worries there. Makes me wonder what people ordered who said they thought what they got was big. Thank goodness we were there at a time we didn't wait in a line. I'd have really felt ripped off. The atmosphere is great. I'll hand them that, but not enough to justify double the price for what is reasonable for what you get. Oh, and I totally agree the cash only policy just adds insult to injury.

I am from Seattle. This store is still in business. I love it. And I love the store. I can't wait to go back. I love this place. It's right next to the train station. It's like a perfect stop for a sweet treat. I got the vanilla custard. It's creamy and not too sweet. I had a scoop of it and it was good. The customer service was also great. We were in the area and I was looking for a place to sit and watch the game. It's a cool little spot."

We were in town visiting and found this place and we're so glad we did. I got the caramel and vanilla gelato.
Food,4.5,CG,"this was the first cupcake that I had ever had. I will say that I was excited to try them. The flavor was spot on. The icing was light, not too sweet and the cake was moist and not overly sweet. 

I ordered a 4"" white chocolate raspberry with cream cheese frosting on top and it was amazing. The blueberry cake was so light and fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness. The strawberry filling was also very flavorful. I got the chocolate chunk cake which was very good, but I would've loved to try it again. I was a little disappointed by the frosting on top but it was still delicious. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie dough cupcake and it was huge. I loved how they were able to mix the flavors and mix the cookie dough"
Food,4.0,CG,"I love Whole Foods.  We have been going to this store since they opened, and since they remodeled it, the prices are much better.  The produce is always fresh and the staff is friendly.  It's a great addition to the area.  I like the fact that the workers are always friendly and helpful.  I love the fact that they are always so helpful.  I just wish there was more variety of items to choose from.  It's very convenient for me to shop here, but I'd be happy to have a place like this in the neighborhood.  I will always return to this store.  The store is clean and well-stocked.  I'll be back.This place is my favorite coffee shop in the area. I've had a few bad experiences here"

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast or a sweet treat. They have a great selection of snacks and treats. I love how they offer a variety of other items and to top it off, they also have a huge selection of gifts for your special occasion. "
Food,4.5,OR,"My German teacher went to school in both France and Germany and is a huge fan of European pastries so when she suggested meeting here for Kaffee und Kuchen I was pretty sure it'd be great. And I was not disappointed: As you can see from the pictures, the various pastries are beautifully executed--truly works of art. 

Based on my teacher's recommendations, I chose an Opera cake and my wife a ""Salted Caramel Margaret"". I loved the texture and flavor of mine and my wife was happy but not overwhelmed with hers. I felt that both were a good bit sweeter than what one would get in France, but that's pretty much par for the course here. (In two weeks we'll be in Paris so a comparison will be possible!).

I chose an espresso to accompany the pastry Unsurprisingly it was a darker roast than you'd normally get in Europe but still excellent.

Now I really want to go back and check out their sandwiches!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Donuts are the best! 

There are so many different types to choose from and the donuts are packed with fillings. Whenever I come to the Bristol-Amish Market, this is a go to place to stop for me. There are the usual glazed donuts, and jelly filled, but there are also apple filled, and pumpkin filled, as well as maple bacon, with bacon pieces on top! 

On this visit, we got a half a dozen, a sugared jelly, an apple fritter, apple filled with a caramel icing on top, a dutch crumb, and a cream filled with chocolate icing on top. The donuts were so fresh and delicious. The donuts are full of flavor and are soft. Out of all the donuts on this visit, my favorite ones are the apple filled and the cream filled. This is my new go to spot when I am craving some donuts. 

The staff are also welcoming and friendly and get the customers quickly through the line."
Food,4.0,OR,"By far the most disgusting place I've ever been/worked. There is so much mold in the ice machine, it's even freezing in the ice along with the metal that is that is chipping off of the machine. That's just the beginning. ""Is there something floating in your drink? I'm so sorry! Let me strain that out for you like the owner tells us to! Here's your drink! Come back and see us!"" Nothing is sanitized, nor is anything washed with soap EVER! The sanitizer is there strictly for show for when the health department comes in. Everything is wiped down with Windex. Wow! How sanitary! There is mold growing in the cooler where the premade daiquiris are stored and spoiled milk caked up on the bottom of it. What kind of creature would you like in your daiquiri?! A roach? Maybe some ants? A mouse? They've got it all! So if you're in the Metairie/Kenner area, swing by and give them your money!"
Food,2.5,OR,"Dear Dunkin' Donuts:

I'm a West Coaster, and we don't have Dunkin' Donuts in our parts. I've heard rumors that your coffee is GOOD. The first time I tried your REGULAR coffee, I thought WOW this is sweet! It doesn't taste at all like coffee, but OK!""

Then, days later when I was pondering the mysterious sweetness of your coffee, an East Coaster informed me that you put massive amounts of sugar in my coffee without my knowledge. I'm used to sugar as an OPTION, not an assumption. 

Now I know that I was tasting SUGAR. So how do I know if your coffee is good or not? 

Don't get me wrong. I LOVE sugar, but NOT in my coffee! I like to control when, where and how much sugar I consume. So, moral of the story is, ASK me if I want sugar in my coffee, people! Please and thank you.

P.S. How do people drink that sugary coffee AND eat a donut?!?! Hello diabetes!"
Food,3.5,OR,"Heaven in a little cup...this gelato though!

We visited this gelato shop upwards of three times. Each visit was just as nice and tasty as the last. I order the gelato with espresso poured one time, gelato macarons,small gelato cone,and even a latte macchiato but the best item I enjoyed was the caffe frappe.

The caffe frappes is a double espresso with two scoops of gelato blended into a smooth drink. I chose dulce de leche and by the time I was finish I was scapping the bottom of the cup for traces of caramel and gelato! 

The staff are pleasant, you are able to sample as many flavors as you want and the line moves very quickly(largely due to thr staff eficiency and system).

This was my favorite place to visit on my way back to our room while visiting for Essence Fest 25. I'll be on the lookout for this little shop in other cities I visit and pray one come to Savannah, GA!"

I asked if I could have another card for the other two cupcakes i bought.  The girl working told me No, only one card per day.  She did not offer me my free cupcake, I did not get the two punches for the other two purchased.  Made no sense to me.  A purchase is a purchase.  Glad I didn't buy a cake.  They could at least allowed me to redeem my free one.  Four cupcakes are $16.00 plus (with tax).  They are great cupcakes, but was disappointed for not getting credit for the two additional I paid for and was not allowed another punch card.  Probably will be awhile before I go back.  (my punch card for my free one will probably expire) ."
Food,3.0,OR,"My go to grocery store!!

I do my grocery shopping bi-weekly, and this is the store I LOVE to go to. I find everything I need for my recipes every single time(with one exception, I wasnt able to find olives w/ pits). The prices are always reasonable and they offer discounts with the club card.
The staff is always friendly and willing to help you find a certain product. The deli & meat counter offer great service as well, I don't have any complaints.
The store in general is always clean and well stocked. 
Another thing that I like about this store is that they have a sushi bar. And trust me the sushi is not bad at all, its not the greatest, but its good. They also make spring rolls and gyoza, but I haven't tried those.

P.S. What I really LOVE is that every month or so, they will mail me coupons for products that I normally buy & free items too!!  
Yes, personalized coupons!!"
Food,3.0,OR,"This is one of my top two locations in Tampa. It's larger than the one I usually go to, but that's only because the other one is closer to my house. Before I moved to my house, this was my main Publix. The managers and staff are excellent. I am an extreme couponer and they really do awesome with all that. In general, Publix is the best grocery store in the state as far as coupons and sales go. Nobody beats their BOGO deals. They are true BOGOs where they don't jack the price up and then offer the BOGO, like some other grocery stores do. And if they are out of a certain product that is on sale, if you go to the service desk they will write you a rain check for it! The store is impeccably clean. The employees always know where something is and help you find it. That doesn't happen at Walmart and other places. Everybody is very friendly."
Food,3.0,OR,"I went to ArtBar for breakfast because my family and I were staying at the hotel. Based on my experience, I recommend staying away from ArtBar for any meal. 

The service was incredibly slow. Although the staff wasn't particularly rude, they were extremely inattentive and ineffective. We waited half an hour for our food and no one apologized or asked how we were doing. 

Once we got our food, it became apparent that the entire operation is subpar. The potatoes were cold and the omelettes were runny and swimming in a yellow liquid. When we asked why there was so much liquid, the waitress made a comment about how butter makes eggs do that. We didn't fight her on that because we had waited so long and she seemed like she wouldn't do anything about it anyway. Instead, we all nibbled away at our mostly inedible food. 

For anyone staying at Sonesta, my suggestion is to go to a nearby diner around the block."

I have tried the praline chip, peanut butter, and lavender ice cream. All were delicious. I wish I had tried the praline chip. It was a great combination. I would definitely recommend the lavender ice cream. It has great flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. I would go back. I always feel very welcome when I come to this Target. The employees are always friendly and helpful. I feel safe going here. There is a Starbucks inside the store that is often busy, but the parking lot is clean.

Food,1.5,CG,"It's surprising the sign says $2. 00 per pound for a cup of coffee. I'm not a coffee snob, but I think that's the deal, so it's pretty expensive. They had a few flavors, so I was excited to try one. I ordered the double chocolate and a chocolate chip cookie. I was disappointed by the fact that they only had one scoop of chocolate chip. It was very small, and it was hard to cut through a cup of ice cream. I'd suggest getting one scoop of ice cream, and adding a shot of ice cream is a big plus. The chocolate chip cookie is really good, but it's not my favorite. I think they had some other flavors, but I don't think they would have any. Overall, I'll be back."
Food,4.5,OR,"oh this place is naughty but so nice!! I loved the ice cream! I had a petit - which is 2 scoops - so I had a gooey butter and a salted caramel crackle- they were both sooo good. They were the first two flavors I tried and I had to get them, so I wonder if they are all just as good! The girl who gave me samples was very generous! and I got mine in a cup with waffle cone pieces, and she gave me an extra cup for the cone pieces to make sure I got my dollars worth ! How nice! I also loved their list of Vegan flavors, and adult flavors. They also have many great toppings, which I am always miss at these types of high quality ice cream shops, so it was a very nice surprise! The place was also very charming, and I'm always a sucker for outdoor seating! another plus is that they are open late!"
Food,2.0,OR,I normally don't rant about these kinds of things but the Dunkin Donuts in Royersford has got to get it together.  Every time I go there they make me pull around and wait by the door or wait in a parking lot.  Well today I pulled around and there is literally a line of people waiting.   For those you you behind us trying to move on with your day.. I'm sorry but DD thinks this way is more efficient. Their sole purpose is to get as many orders without thinking about what's waiting around the bend.  Twice I almost got into a fender vender because of the chaos!  Let me tell ya DD will be dealing with me if that happens! I mean I understand once in a while but it is every single time.  They inconvenience people just to get those orders in!

Vinly 45's surrounded the entrance as you are greeted by golden oldies on the speakers. There is a small room available to host private parties, a play room with fun educational toys, indoor seating, and even shelves full of books to enjoy. Sign me up! The previous bank drive thri has been converted into a cute little outdoor seating area. It's too cute to miss! The staff was extremely fun and friendly.

I'll be a regular here for sure! Enjoy!"

The fresh baked breads are wonderful and you can watch the donuts being made - so good! Handmade pretzel rolls, fudge, soups, salads, smoked meats, and the list goes on! There is also a section of furniture and housewares - nice stuff but a little pricey. They have pig roasts in the summer and fresh made ice cream. There are some handmade towels and other small home goods for sale along with fresh flowers. Definitely make a stop at the drink stall and get a fresh smoothie. Huge section of sweets and penny candy. This place is for the foodies! There are 2 areas to sit and eat prepared food. I highly recommend the smoked kielbasa and fried chicken . Also a small section of lotions and remedies. Only open 3 days a week so check the hours but definitely go!"

I also love that they have a few tables outside, which is great for having a few people working.

I did get a scoop of the vanilla bean ice cream, which was awesome.  I also tried the mint chocolate chip.  I don't like mint so I got it with mint chocolate chips.  The mint chocolate chip was very good.  I think it's a little more expensive than a normal ice cream place, but it's still a good choice for a good ice cream.  They have a small selection of ice cream flavors, including their own signature flavors.  I also got their birthday"
Food,5.0,OR,"This ice cream shop is truly like by many. The stars will tell you so. It is not easy to find. But the local know where it located. You have go to the back of the plaza and wonder you are at the wrong place, but just right there, you found the ice cream shop. 

They have many homemade ice cream. The flavor can be learn by many ice cream shop. I try all four flavors, and I like them all. I settled for two flavors. One is the loopy. It is with fruit loop and vodka fruit loop. You have to be 21 years old to try it. The other is the coconut blueberry. Both of them has wonderful taste. 

My wife has chocolate bacon toffee. It sprinkled with candy bacon. BACON. Definitely people love the most in their food. It is gluten free also. The clerk is helpful and has knowledge about the ice cream flavor. This will help customers to make the decision."
Food,4.5,OR,"In the last week I've already eaten two bundt cakes from here. I would go here over other cupcake and sliced cake shops in town. I've actually been craving it everyday since eating my first bundtlet.

The bundtlet is a perfect portion for one or two people to share as a snack. The cake is very moist, fluffy, rich in flavor, and pretty sweet without being overly saccharine. Even my mother who is critical of desserts ate her entire birthday bundtlet (you get one free on your birthday with email subscription). You can taste how much sugar and cream cheese went into each cake; it's an ideal combination for a sweet tooth.

The shop operation is cutesy and professional with girly decorations and a daily rotating sample flavor. My favorite so far is by far the white chocolate raspberry. Lemon is good if you're into that, and marble would have to come in third.

I look forward to coming to Nothing Bundt Cakes again very soon, like maybe tomorrow."
Food,4.5,OR,"Sooooo... I don't get all the hype about Ted Drewes. It's not amazing (am I allowed to say that?), but it's decent. Well, actually, let me back up a little and say that I'm not from St. Louis. Maybe that clears things up for some of you about why I'm not on the Ted Drewes bandwagon, but I know that for me, it's because their frozen custard is just so so (again, decent, but not amazing). That said, they do have a ton of flavors and it's pretty cheap for how much custard you get. 

Even though the crowd (and the parking lot) might look packed, you actually get your custard (or concrete or sundae or whatever) pretty quickly seeing as they have a lot of lines and cash registers open. Just consider that as part of the experience! 

I'm not as attached as some others are to Ted Drewes, but I would definitely consider going if I had a craving for something cold and sweet!"

You can bring in food and enjoy the delicious variety of brews! Cozy couches, tons of games and now even some pinball machines! My husband and his buddy of over 20 years were a force to be reckoned with on the foosball table last visit a little over a week ago!

Staff are always fabulous and can help recommend a brew if you aren't able to put your finger on that craving you're having. Parking throughout FS can get hairy but the new garage nearby helps a ton! Don't be a dummy and park at Goodwill or in other business lots where you can get towed. Better yet, use an Uber, Lyft, Bicycle, or your own two feet to bring you to Fountain Square. The area is a blast to explore and you can start and end with a fabulous brewery!"
Food,3.0,OR,"I've been to this Starbucks a few times. I'm definitely a Starbucks aficionado, lol!  David, the barista from Latimer is here!  There's another barista from Walnut St. , a friendly bunch!  They have ample seating here too which is great, plenty of tables and chairs. I would give 5 stars but I think it's kinda lame that they want to hold onto your ID or keys while you borrow the bathroom key, I just think that's kinda dumb. I don't understand why they can't just have a keypad on the door and give you the code like other Starbucks do. I don't like having to leave my personal property with a barista. If it weren't for that issue and the line getting backed up, I would have given 5 stars. I will keep coming here occasionally but it's not the closest one to me, so I'll visit the Bellevue and Latimer more often since they're closer."

It's not overly sweet like a lot of bubble tea places. It was refreshing and flavorful. The Taro Milk Tea tasted like it was made with boba. I wish I could have gotten a bigger size! I highly recommend it! The bubbles are so soft and chewy. The sweetness is perfect. It's not too sweet, it's just not too sweet. I would definitely recommend it!

It was great. I got the peanut butter and it was pretty good. It was $4.50 for a small scoop. I would definitely recommend the peanut butter, but I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter. I think it was a good price for ice cream. I would have liked to get the peanut butter and cookie dough flavor to be more ""fruity"" than the Oreo flavor. Overall, a great experience!This is"

I had the Chicken wings and the fried chicken wings, both of which were delicious. The fried chicken wings were good, but they were a little dry for my liking. The wings were a bit too spicy for me and I'm not sure if it was due to the proximity of the chicken wings, but I'm sure it was.

The prices are very reasonable for the area, and I'd definitely return.Coffee, service, and ambiance is great. We loved it and will be back.

Food,1.5,OR,"Went in this store for foil, was informed it was a seasonal item. Since store changed from Rite Aid, you can definitely tell it was gone down a bit. I was in there last Friday and was buying a few cleaning products (I won't start my rant on the prices) and could clearly hear one of the store employees talking throughout the entire store, on the phone and standing behind the registers. She was ranting on about how she bought a relative a wedding dress and that if she didn't like it, she could sell it on eBay. When I approached the cashier I could tell she was a bit uncomfortable standing up there with that lady yappin' about a darn dress ON THE PHONE. I think she may have also been a Manager, which is even worse! You would think that the store would be in tip top shape as it is in South Reno. I never get this type of service from the Pink Scholari's."

Like seeing an old friend after many moons or finding your favorite pair of cozy pants you thought you'd lost.  OK, maybe my metaphors are stretching a little thin there, but you catch my drift!

I've worked in the NoLib area on & off for over 10 years, and I feel like this place has always been a part of the neighborhood.  I'm not even sure when they opened, but it's always been a relaxed place to get a good cup of coffee or a great cup of tea and just chill.  No stink-eye for taking up precious ""real-estate"" or uppity folk trying to look cool in a hip cafe, it's just a nice coffee shop with decent food & sweets.  Highly recommended if you have time to kill & are looking for a comfy couch and beverage."
Food,4.5,OR,"Went to the market they had in Old Hyde park yesterday, what a fantastic time! The streets were closed down and there was music, dogs and families. I was hoping for more vendors since it's the perfect time of year to spend some time and really soak in the atmosphere. 

We tried everything and left with hands full of bags from produce, dog biscuits and a few yard ornaments for some family members. The stores the take residence there are open and welcoming. If I hadn't had my two large dogs I would have spent more time walking into the shops  but none allow dogs which I understand. The parking was ample with three garages and since one of my pooches has bad hips the elevators are a plus. There was a man playing guitar that keep did a wonderful job of captivating the audiences of all ages, he really turned into the MC of the event. Can't wait until the next one, hopefully more vendors!"
Food,4.5,OR,"With dear friends in Ohio, JSIC came with huge recommendations from them.  With flavors like Ugandan Vanilla Bean, they had me at the letter U!  The Bourbon Butter Pecan is also a signature amazement, but whew..it's got kick.  If you're going to try the Thai Peanut, be ready with a glass of water to calm it down.  My personal fave, The Buckeye State, a blend of chocolate and peanut butter making it one of the most traditional tastes in the freezer.

Bring your piggy bank.  One scoop is going to cost you a whopping $4, and it's a tiny scoop.

The location couldn't be any better.  Sandwiched between Silly Goose and Wild Cow and across the street from Eastland Cafe and Rose Pepper Cantina, you can't miss this place for after meal dessert.  The decór ultra fresh and modern with chalkboard menus and sleek furnishings.  

Definitely a welcome addition to the granola east side.  Now, to not gain the weight!"

The sausage is ok, but it's not really good.I came here for the first time today. The staff was super nice. I was a bit disappointed because I had to wait on them for about 30 minutes. I was quite surprised to see that there was only one girl working and that's not a problem. I thought the prices were a little high but I felt the service was okay.

If you are there well before the pharmacy closes (45 minutes to be exact) and there is an issue between the insurance company and what's coming up in your system please do not rush me/insurance company off the phone. The pharmacist had an attitude and had the nerve to say ""uhhhh I closed 15 minutes ago"" while the insurance company was trying to figure out why the 0 dollar copay that they were seeing was not coming up on the walgreens side. The issue was she didn't want to stay and help. I could understand getting there at 959. but I have worked retail and let me tell you if a customer comes in BEFORE YOU CLOSE IT IS good buisness to help the customer out. There is also no need to huff and puff, pace back and forth, tap your fingers, and slam things."
Food,3.5,OR,"Upon walking in it seemed more like a hangout for USF students than a dessert shop. The staff was NOT helpful at all! I asked about the Krazy Kookie dough flavor because it looked different than your average cookie dough Ice cream, and the only response I received was that it had ""cookie dough in it"". I could have guessed that myself. I went with a cookie a la mode and for 9 bucks I got two small scoops of ice cream on top of a plain cookie with some mini marshmallows and chocolate chips on it (s'mores flavor). it honestly tasted like something I could have got at Walmart for cheaper. In theory this late night sweet spot would have been a great gem for those mid night cravings but the reality is that the food is mediocre and overpriced and I can't even say that at the very least the staff was friendly. I honestly would have had a better time ordering from a dead fish."

I was desperate for a beignet and thought I'd have to trek all the way to the French Quarter for some beignet goodness. Thankfully, my Uber driver told me that there was a Cafe Du Monde location right in the mall that was attached to my hotel! I was in New Orleans for three days and stopped by Cafe Du Monde every day. I definitely ate my body weight's worth of beignets - the beignets were fresh, delicious, and completely covered in powdered sugar. Be prepared to get messy! Also, since I'm not a coffee person, instead of trying their famous coffee with chicory, I opted for a hot chocolate, which was delicious! This location can get pretty busy. So, depending on the time of day, be prepared to wait. Worth the wait though! Highly recommend Cafe Du Monde!"

I would go back if I were in the area. The only downside is that they are not open 24 hours. This place is super busy and the people that work there are super nice.

Sherwood Park was our first location to get a liquor store in the greater Edmonton area but now we also have them in St. Albert and Edmonton.

The selection isn't huge but it is varied from $8 bottles of wine up to a couple hundred dollars.  I love giving the GIANT and I mean giant bottles of Kirkland Signature alcohol as Christmas presents - who doesn't want a gallon of spiced rum or vodka?  I know, I sure do and this present won't go to waste!

They carry a great seasonal selection and don't miss out on the ever popular Christmas import beer advent calendar for that beer drinker in your life!

They use spot on so if you have a spot on account or the key tag which I do remember to scan it. Both of the cupcakes were dry. The icing on both could be completely picked up in one hand. I don't know what was wrong with them. I had read the reviews and really thought they would be great. I don't know if it was the end of the day or what but I was not impressed with either one of them. The cake didn't have any flavor to them. The sugar cookie dough icing was good, but dense and heavy. I will go back and try it out again when they have more cupcakes available too. I don't know if it was an off day or what. Hopefully it will be better next time around."
Food,4.5,OR,"RATC is a phenomenal craft beer and games bar in St. Pete's burgeoning Grand Central District. The two main bartenders, Tom and Johnny, have great passion for providing a variety of rare craft beers to their customers. One of the most charming things about the bar is the drive from the owners to get kegs from smaller, lesser-known Florida breweries. I have learned of numerous new places making great beer through the taps at RATC. 

Outside of the beer, the selection of arcade, video and board games is awesome. St. Pete really did have a big hole for a games bar and it is fantastic that Right Around the Corner was able to plop right in and feel like a storied St. Pete establishment after being open for a soft six months. 

There is a ton of potential with RATC and Johnny's drive to host events (he is one of the founders of the Flavor Run) as the bar continues to grow shows great potential for this fantastic bar."
Food,4.0,OR,"I visited Green Bench on Saturday prior to St. Patrick's Day.  I found it very busy, and somewhat anticipated that prior to arriving.  They however did not anticipate a large crowd, and had significant difficulty keeping up with the service.  

I personally am not a beer drinker, however went with other friends.  We took the tour of the brewery.  The tour is quite informative of their process, and they provide you with a 10oz tasting pour during the tour.  I tried they Sour IPA.  It was far closer to an IPA than a sour.  I in fact had a very difficult time, distinguishing any sour notes at all.

This is a very small eclectic place.  It seems to be the talk of the town, around St. Pete.  I was interested in seeing what all the hype was about.  I don't think I'll return, it's just not my scene.  

Atmosphere was very loud, pushy crowd.  Very clean establishment."
Food,4.5,OR,"Levee baking co. is such a great addition to the area
They sell local jams that come in all sorts of super fun flavors, local coffee beans from multiple roasters, and have awesome local art filling up their space.
My only complaint is that they're closed on Mondays/Tuesdays. I came for a cinnamon roll once on a Monday morning and I'm not gonna lie it really hurt that they weren't open to feed me. I usually go for the cinnamon roll, however it seems like recently they've been rolling the flaky croissant dough cinnamon goodness in a much finer sugar with less cinnamon in it- bring back the coarser sugar/more cinnamon-y version! Their savory goods are fantastic as well, I love their sausage roll, it's like a grown-up pig in a blanket, with local fennel sausage from Piece of Meat Butcher wrapped inside of buttery flaky puff pastry rolled in everything seasoning.
A great spot for a quick bite, although it's also a great spot to get some reading or work done."

The manager was very rude and very unprofessional. I had to call back the next day to let them know I was going to be in a different store. They were so rude and didn't want to help.

The staff is friendly and helpful. The only problem is that the workers don't seem to know the difference between ice cream and ice cream. It is also a little bit pricey, but I think the ice cream is worth it. I would go back if I were in the area. I've been here twice, and I haven't had a bad experience.

Food,4.5,OR,"I love this place!  I've been coming here for many years and they are amazing.  A real warning...if you try some of the cheeses (they are always willing to give you a sample of anything in the case), Pesto, etc.  you will quickly become addicted and spend lots of money!  

Everything I have had at Claudio's has been excellent.  They have a special, aged Balsamic Vinegar - that is fabulous.  You can choose from a wide variety of Olive Oils, as well as a vast array of Olives.  Try the grilled olives...easily addictive!  Their Pesto is imported and stimulated the taste buds in such a way that you just crave more.

If you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait in line.  The line moves, but they give personal service and is well worth the wait.  Most folks in line are friendly and will chat about the Italian Market or restaurants nearby.

Food,3.0,OR,"I had really high hopes because I heard great things, but I was really disappointed with my drink. I ordered a strawberry rose milk tea (which I usually get at boba stores that allow you to customize your own drink flavors) and every other store gives me a milky, fruity light pink drink. But I got a drink that was BARELY milky. I wouldn't even classify it as a milk tea. The flavoring is all just really dense syrups and it's wayyyy to sweet. They over did the sweetness and I can't imagine what it would taste like if I got a more potent flavor (like passionfruit or lychee). Maybe this place has great fruit teas, but as for milk teas, this was a huge disappointment.

Also, the employee was extremely rude. Maybe she just was having a bad day, but she forcefully handed me my drink and didn't even say anything. She just walked away without any form of customer service interaction and coldly shoved the drink on the counter."
Food,4.0,OR,"Been shopping at Wegmans for years and rarely have issues. Until today. My husband searched for a particular flavor of beer he was wanting to try, but could not find it. He could not find an associate to help him since it was busy. So he settled for another flavor. Then 5 minutes after purchasing the alternative, he walked around and then found the flavor he wanted in the fridge. He immediately brought it back to register to ask for a swap. He was then told, very rudely by the cashier that beer cannot be returned or exchanged. My husband was unaware of that policy, and the fact we did not leave the store or the beer section and it was minutes later made it very frustrating. Wine and spirit stores have a 90 day refund/exchange policy. Some beer distributors also take exchanges. So buyer beware--be sure you really want your beer before purchasing. A policy is a policy, but no need for the employees to be rude about it."
Food,3.5,OR,"I recently moved to the Lafayette Square area and was very excited to see a grocery store so close by. The store itself is nice and the workers have all been friendly each time I have been in.

The major factor that has caused me to stop going to this Field's is the produce section. I have had issues with the produce at this location more frequently than hoped for. Often when I have gone in, many of the produce items have looked wilted or old. Multiple times I have purchased vegetables or herbs and have gotten back home to find them rotten. Other times I have gone in and simply found the produce item I needed nowhere to be found. Why would there not be basil or Italian parsley available? 

I really want to like this store due to its location and generally friendly staff. However, I don't know that it is a permanent option for me due to the large amounts of produce we consume on a regular basis."

They are rude and will not help you. They are rude and refuse to help you. I don't know how they can do it, but they don't care. I've had bad experiences at this place. I'm not sure if they're too friendly or just lazy, but if they want to help you, they're just plain rude. I'm not sure why they are here anymore. I understand it's a different demographic, but it's too bad. I'd rather go to a different place and get to a different location.This is my favorite coffee shop in the area.

Food,2.5,OR,"I can't believe I'm actually writing another CVS review, but hey, maybe it will be helpful to someone. This CVS is not bad. It usually has the essential items you look for when you walk into a CVS. For whatever reason, it seems as though every time I come here, no matter the time of day, there are also huge boxes blocking the aisles as they stock the shelves. Isn't there a specific time when this is done, like very early in the morning or after closing? I used to work in retail and this is how it was done.

Now, my biggest gripe with this particular location is the self checkout area and their placement. When there is a heavy flow of traffic, it usually leads to two lines. Maybe it's not a big deal, but if you're waiting on line and someone on the other line goes in front of you when you know you were ahead of them, then it's time to act crazy and burn the place down."
Food,2.5,OR,"Went to Starbucks this morning because I wanted coffee, and just got paid. Something about paying for overpriced coffee just makes it taste so much better, am I right? I pull in the entrance and have to wait in line. Booo. I thought about parking and just walking in, but immediately turned down that dumb idea. If I'm tired enough that I'm willing to pay $5 for some caffeine, there ain't no way I'm leaving my car. I'd hate to overexert myself. Noo way. The line moved fast, I ordered my drinks. I watched a bug fly around the car in front of me. Everything is running smoothly at this point. I get to the window. The barista was super nice, I pay for my drinks - I'll regret the purchase later. I included a tip -because good karma and suches (probably). Drinks were great - well mine was. The other was for my mom, but I'll just assume hers was good too. 

Overall, great time. Coffee good. 5 trillion stars."

The staff is seriously the most friendly staff I have ever encountered anywhere.  And if you know how to shop, you can get great deals.  It's not the cheapest store--but if you plan, and only buy what's on sale each week, you can make it into one of the cheapest!  The Acme brands are great deals and they never disappoint.  They have tons of 10 for $10 deals (and PS people you don't need to buy 10 to get the $1 each price!).  It's close to my house, friendly, and economical.  Not to mention clean and well stocked.  I love this Acme."

I was in and out of there within 2 days. The staff was extremely helpful. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. I was amazed at how fast the staff was and how fast the check out process was. I went to pick up some random items and they didn't have a single item I was looking for. I went back to the store and was told they had it. I was so amazed that they didn't have it.

Food,4.5,OR,"Before I even arrived in Tampa, I had heard about Revolution, it is my friend's favorite place for ice cream; she made sure to tell me when they were having a free scoop day that I obviously could not attend, so of course when I came to visit, I had to stop here. All their flavors looked amazing! They had a few flavors themed after Girl Scout cookies as well as their normal flavors (I was informed they usually have them so I trust what I was told). Get the most of your visit by getting a sampler. It comes in an egg carton with 6 good size scoops.  You could eat it all yourself, but that would be a lot so it is a good thing to share. We got Chocolate Shock, Euro Trash, Grandma's Oreo, a cheesecake flavor, and a few of the Girl Scout cookie flavors. Euro Trash and the cheesecake one were my favorite. I love this place and hope to stop here again on another visit."
Food,3.5,OR,"Since I've moved to downtown a couple of months ago, I've usually stopped in this store two or three times a week on my way home from work. The sushi in the deli is passably good and the salad bar - when stocked - is fresh and has a variety. The produce is overpriced, but, overall, I figured it was a good trade off since the location is so convenient. 

Now, I'm done. The deals have been getting steadily slimmer and the lines to check-out have been getting much longer. Tonight at 7:30 pm, I went in and found many of the shelves weren't stocked and the check-out lines were so long they  reached all the way back to the deli. I tried to wait it out, but, when I realized the lines were barely moving and only growing longer, I put everything in my basket back where I found it and walked out without buying a thing.

I was seriously surprised at how sturdy the to-go boxes were. Of course being the buyer of the cupcakes, I got a bite of both theirs. :) The birthday cake one was definitely my favorite. Loves all the round sprinkles. Those are my favorite sprinkles. The cookies and cream icing was very good also. I love peanut butter, so I was excited to dig into mine. The problem is I hate chocolate cake. So this is always a dilemma for me. However, I was very disappointed in the whole thing. The cake part of it was ok I guess, for chocolate cake, but the peanut butter icing was just awful. Like... almost-pb flavored icing. But didn't quite get there. Ugh. I was so, so incredibly sad. We may try it again another time and try a different one. But we might still to FroYo."
Food,4.5,OR,"Definitely my go to milk tea stop! 

I've been here quite a few times before writing this review. I've tried most milk teas and even floats from here. I have not one bad think to say about any of the flavors. Créeme brûlée was my favor along side lychee with strawberry popping boba. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the teas.

I saw the advertisement for there pop corn chicken and thought they had very interesting flavors so I go the two most unique flavor and tried them. Let me tell you... best decision! The curry and basil popcorn chicken was to die for. I had to to stop myself from going to day as I've been 3 days in a row. 

I would definitely give this place a try! There is lots of options to choose from like organic, no dairy, etc. The shop it's self is beautifully decorated very trendy and cute. If I could give them more stars I would. Definitely a regular here now."
Food,4.5,OR,"Banana Nutella croissant was buttery and flaky. Surprisingly the banana went really well with it, I will note that the croissant was small but it's as good as Renaud's bakery.
The blueberry scone reminded me of cornbread. I am guessing that it's gluten-free.
Lemon bar was delicious. Did not have the egg taste, was not sour, but something about it made me want to eat more.
The sourdough bread was good, but I wish it was a little bit more sour. My guess is that people in Santa Barbara don't like their sourdough bread super sour like San Francisco style (it's hard to find super sour tasting sourdough bread around here)

We originally came to see if they had pies but was told we would have to let them know ahead of time. After tasting some of their baked good, I want to come back and try some of their pie!

Service is good, food is delicious as will come back.  Parking can be a little difficult but they do have one parking spot for customers."

She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and she said no.  I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.  I was turned away by her attitude.  She was very friendly and gave me a few extra things for free.  I'm not sure if she was just annoyed that she was not wearing a mask and she was wearing her mask.  She was also not wearing a mask properly.  I'll be taking my business elsewhere.  If I'm ever in the area again, I'll probably stick with the farmers market.This is a very cool place with good drinks."

Food,4.0,OR,"A visit to New Orleans is not complete without stopping here. It really doesn't matter what time you drop by, it's always crowded. I do recommend to get there first thing in the morning before they open because that's when the line is not as long. 

We got there a few minutes before they opened so the staff was still setting up. We decided to sit outside in a corner. Someone came over as soon as 8am hit. 

I knew we were having breakfast so this was just a morning snack. We got an order of the beignet which comes with 3 so we all got one. I opted to get a hot chocolate instead of their famous cafe au lait. 

The hype is definitely real. That beignet was perfection. I enjoyed every bite. I could've easily eaten 3 to myself. The hot chocolate came in handy because it was so cold in the morning.  

My only regret is that I didn't come here every morning to start my day off right."
Food,3.5,OR,"I have been a great customer of 4Patriots. This part has vitamins and nutrients. I bought the Power Greens and it did give me energy until my IBS kicked in. I am very sensitive to food, meds, etc. so it is not the product's fault. I wish it worked for me because I loved the energy I got( usually I don't have the energy anymore like I used to! They used to call me the Energizer Bunny!). But what I wanted to say is this company was great and honored the return policy and gave me a full refund. They were very gracious and expedient. I could go to other similar companies, but I believe in this one and feel it is more trustworthy, being patriotic made in the USA products which I try to support US businesses! I will remain loyal to this brand new company and like how it comes through for you and they are straightforward! I also like they support vets and they are a family owned business."

I looked confused so I gave him some more change because it should have only been 3 dollars.... so then he yells at me again and says ""3.25 MORE THE TOTAL IS 6.75""... uhhh first of all check your orders, my order should have been 3 DOLLARS. NOT 6.75. I think they tried to scam me. 2 egg and cheese wake up wraps and hash browns is 3 dollars, NOT 6.75... @ all of your employees maybe pay more attention to people's orders and stop trying to scam people.

Food,5.0,OR,"Even though the 'Rona has got things on lock, businesses like Americano are still going strong. And I needed a little fresh air and quick break from staying inside, so I came to kill three birds with one stone - get my air, get my coffee, and support a business!

Americano has their main dining room closed down, but still providing stellar service from an open window register. They have expanded some of their options to include food and alcohol packages, as well as groceries. I opted for the 'breakfast for one', which included a latte and crossaint sandwich (I got the Autumn Leaves latte, and Spinach and Ricotta - excellent) for a little under $10. 

Even though we're still weeks off from when we can once again enjoy in-house brunches, I appreciate these businesses staying open and giving us a preview of what we can look forward to once the warm weather - and safer times - come back. Will definitely come back to check Americano out when next I visit the area!"

Food,4.0,CG,"Been here a few times and have always been very pleased with the quality of the product.  The owner is always very nice and will let you sample the flavor before you purchase.  The only downside is that the flavors are a bit on the sweeter side.  If you have a sweet tooth, this is your place.  I can't wait to try out their other flavors.  My favorite is the peach pie.  The only downside is that it's very pricey.  

The only downside is that it's cash only.  

However, the shop is always clean and well-stocked.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.

Food,4.0,OR,"This Aldi is brand new and on the large side for an Aldi. It's clean and fairly attractive inside. The produce is fresh and they have a good selection of meats.

Most products at Aldi are private label brands, but the quality is pretty good. The prices on the private label products are great. Be aware that the prices on the handful of brand name products that are available aren't a bargain.

It's hard to do all of your grocery shopping at Aldi, since they have a limited and changing range of products available, but you can save on certain items there, and it's a great place to pick up ""something for dinner"" when you don't have your heart set on making a particular recipe.

I also give them bonus points for the fun-to-browse section with non-grocery odds and ends.  There are tools, decorations, small appliances, and whatever else they choose to put there. Sometimes you can stumble upon a great deal on something you've wanted, and there's usually some interesting gadget I've never seen before."
Food,4.5,OR,"Fantastic ice cream shop!  They sell really inventive and super yummy flavors.  I just moved to the area and I think this place is going to be a frequent stop for me.  They are also on UberEATS which is very dangerous.  My friend and I decided to try the sampler tray so we could taste more flavors.  The sampler tray looks like an egg cartoon and you get six mini scoop of ice cream.  When we first saw the egg cartoon, we thought it wasn't going to be enough ice cream but we were wrong.  The mini scoops were a good size and the two of use barely finished it.  Some of the flavors came with toppings which was really fun.  My favorites were the manatee tracks with a peanut butter drizzle, the mint with cookie dough and the hot cakes with maple syrup topping!  All of them flavors were excellent though.  I don't think you could go wrong with any of them."
Food,4.0,OR,"Pros: 
I love the idea of Local Harvest! Supporting a local business, buying local produce and meats, and having a variety of vegetarian and vegan options are all awesome, cool things that I support. 

Also, they have a free seed library! They have it organized by what kinds of plants you're trying to grow as well as the level of experience required to successfully grow it. There are instructions on how to harvest seeds from what you do plant so that you can give back to the seed library and keep it going. 

The beer and especially the wine selection quite large, considering the tiny size of the store. The alcohol section takes up probably a good quarter of the store! 

Cons: 
However, I just can't make it my main grocery store because it's on the pricey side and the selection is pretty limited. 

Overall, though, what small selection they do have is fresh and local, so if you're willing to pay a higher price, go ahead and do it! You won't regret it!"

The cheese board was pretty good, and the crackers were a bit too dry. I don't know how many people were there to try this wine, but I'm pretty sure the wine is good enough to fill your taste buds. I liked the reds, and they did have some unique ones, so I can't speak to them. The service was great, and the wine was great, but I didn't get to try any of the wines that they had, but I can't say it was bad, but I would have liked to have gotten to try some more of the wines if I had had a few more of the time.

Food,4.5,OR,"This place was one of my favorites when we visited Philly. 

1. The food is amazing. The menu was the perfect size not too much that you feel overwhelmed and not too small that you feel like you don't have options. We ordered the Ajika Benedict and the Mushroom Stroganoff. It was just so yummy!! I had the Mushroom Stroganoff and I think it was the best thing I have ever tasted. There is nothing like this here in California. 
The menu also was very vegan friendly which was much appreciated. 
2. The beers were very good. We tried a couple and the Space race was very good as well as the shade of specter and behmoth. The stout was very rich and tasty. The shade of specter was very yummy and different from the beers I normally get but was very delicious and refreshing. 
3. The decor was nice I thought it could have been a little more with the theme but still a very nice place. Very clean and everyone was very friendly."
Food,4.0,OR,"We attended Indy Popcon at this location, and it was a little overbooked at the time with multiple conventions going on. Most Popcon attendees wouldn't know this unless they had to use an elevator, but it was difficult to navigate through the construction dudes who were standing shoulder to shoulder in another wing. Unfortunately, they've changed the elevators to make it difficult for those who have a large cosplay to be able to get downstairs to the events from some of the hotels. The place was nice and our actual location was spacious, but the food court left a lot to be desired. There weren't many options, and the ones we tried were sort of cold and overpriced.

I was a bit disappointed in the way some of the seating in the venue had been set up, but that's probably moreso on the con and not the center. If there had been a better food court area and the elevators placed a little better for those staying at the Westin, I'd have given it four stars."
Food,2.0,OR,"I know it's dumb to review a Walmart, and even dumber to visit a Walmart. But, I was in the area for the weekend helping my dad, and he sent me here for a few things.

Pulling up, I thought the Walmart had closed and moved. I honesly thought I was in the wrong place and was totally confused. The outside looks like it's being torn down, and there was no signage at all. As I walked up, I saw a small Walmart sign by the door. What is up with this, Walmart? 

Inside, I didn't get any farther than the frozen food section, which is right when you walk in, so that was convenient. I was looking for a very specific frozen pizza, which they didn't have. Sigh...I used my dad's debit card, and the cashier didn't question it. Is that good or bad?

To be fair, this place is more bearable than my local South Philly Walmart (a.k.a. hell on earth.) BUT, that Walmart deserves negative 10 stars, which makes this one-star review pretty reasonable."
Food,4.5,OR,"I don't know why I have to stop at wineries everywhere I go. Oh yeah, 'cause I'm a drunk.

Being that the last wineries I've been was were France, this was quite an amusing experience to go to one in Indiana. If you want a low-brow wine experience, this is the place. They have a huge selection of super sweet wines, some they even encourage you to mix with rum and make cocktails out of. How about a bottle of Reggae Red, along with little dancing Jamaicans on it? Or a bottle of Posey Red, from unclassifiable grapes found only in Posey County Indiana that tastes like grape juice with added sugar?

They did offer a tour of the winery followed by 6 free wine tastings. The 6 free wine tastings turned into about 12 and we actually found a few great bottles of Reserves. They probably aren't worth the $20-25 we paid for them, but with the free tour and tastings and laughs with the amazing people that work there, we definitely got our money's worth."

Food,5.0,OR,"Skip the other local dessert shops, Ice Cave is the cheapest and tastiest shaved ice place around UCity! Located around ~46th and Baltimore, it is a bit of a walk from campus but definitely worth it. The place is a small hole in the wall, I didn't even notice it was there the first time I walked by, but the desserts are delicious and a great size for what you pay.

They have a selection of bubble teas, Asian-inspired ice pops, something called ""wheel cakes"" which is on my to-try list, but most importantly, their shaved ice is top-notch. My favorite is the Mt. Fuji- matcha ice with a sizable portion of mochi and toffee bits (they complement the ice cream surprisingly well!), and topped with condensed milk. Their board has a list of other specialties, but the Mt. Fuji is always a good choice.

Service is fast and so friendly, and the quality of the dessert and prices rival the top Chinatown places. Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you, this place is definitely worth a visit!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Love this place. We come here for the rotating beer menu, friendly patio, and atmosphere. The bar tenders are all super friendly and the beer selection is always fun. Located a little further from campus and tucked away from a main road, this place boasts a quieter and more relaxed atmosphere. The location in the Metal Arts Village comes with the fun of various events and it is an easy ride from the Rillito Bike Path. Their backyard is relaxing and a welcoming zero-scape that provides space for restless children and anxious dogs alike. 

Varying from the beer selection, we had also attended a wine tasting event at Tucson Hop Shop. They had brought in two wine makers who were incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and courteous. Knowing very little about wine, I found this to be a great opportunity to ask them questions. 

I am confident that when my schedule clears out a bit, I'll become a regular here. I would argue that this place is a Tucson Hidden Gem and look forward to my next visit."

Food,4.5,OR,"Usually a fan as Blueprint is actually hip and cool AND in St Louis. But today on Friday morning as I sit with one other patron for the last half hour I think if I were the owner who ponied up all the cash to make it look so nice I'd be thinking: ""oh my gosh I'm about to go out of business.""

Then I remember being one of 5 patrons when I got here, 3 of which were already served and it took - no kidding - 15 minutes to get a latte and a scone. Oblivious, inept help was laughing and smiling in a little chit chat group that said ""I clearly don't give a shit"". 

So if you've got an hour on your hands and want some good coffee - this is your place! If you have a job, well that's gonna be a problem unless you give yourself an extra 45 minutes.

Diversity of products are a little bit limited. It will have most of what you need though. When we were initially in the middle of a pandemic, we ordered online and the process wasn't smooth despite ordering plenty of time before they closed. They have a couple spots marked off for you to park to call your order in to have someone drop off your online order to make you feel safe w/a touchless process. I ended up on canceling my order despite showing my receipt to the employee when I went inside. We were refunded the money by canceling online & I picked up the item at the store - this area def. needs improvement.

Overall, service has been good because we got what we needed other times even if it required some digging in the store with help!

Food,4.5,OR,"We came here with our friends as they have raved about the ice cream here. They have a wide selection of unique flavors that you can sample of before buying. I wish I did this. I ordered the sweet biscuit and peach jam ice cream. I figured, hey, Im in the south, gonna try some southern takes. Plus with the peach jam, the sweet flavor should be kicked up a notch. Well, it wasn't. The ice cream was sour and salty, not a trace of peach jam anyway. Biscuit bits were in every bite, no peaches. This one had so much potential but fell short. One of my friends got a strawberry flavor (was a limited time one) and it was delicious. BF tried the pistachio one and he really liked it. Despite my flavor being a melt down, the other flavors my friends had were really good, which bumped my original 3 stars to a 4.

The store is always well stocked and it's always clean. I've never had a bad experience with any of the staff."
Food,2.0,CG,"I'm going to start this review with the fact that they are a franchise that makes the customer feel like a customer.  The people that work here are the most unhappy and rude people I have ever encountered.  It's clear that they hate their jobs.  I've been coming here for years and they always have a great attitude.  

I love the idea of this location because it's close to my house.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I feel like it's the only location in the area that I've ever been to.  It's always crowded and people are usually at the registers.  They do have a decent selection of fresh fruits and veggies and the prices are very reasonable.  I've never had an issue with any of the staff here.  It's very clean and the place is nice.

Food,3.0,CG,"This has got to be one of the best ice cream places in town! The variety of flavors is so so unique and delicious. The ice cream is the best in the city and it's worth the visit. It's a little pricey but it's worth it!It's not that the people working at this location are the most rude, but the store is clean and well stocked. They have a great selection of beer, wine and liquor. The staff is always friendly and helpful. They have a lot of fresh produce, meats, produce, and other items. I love the fact that they are always there to answer any questions you may have. I can't say enough about the staff. I like their customer service, especially at the cashier, who always knows their name and is super helpful. I went here with a group of friends on a Friday night."
Food,4.5,OR,"If you love fancy oils, vinegars and salts and you have not yet been to Cardenas, what are you waiting for?! This local biz has jugs upon jugs of delicious oils and vinegars, plus a wall of various types of salt. You can taste anything in the store, and the folks who run the place are super knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. 

After purchasing a rather pricey bottle of locally-produced olive oil while in Sonoma County recently, I can definitely attest to Cardenas' prices being more than fair. I was able to buy a bottle of very nice oil AND a bottle of vinegar to go along with for just slightly more than what I paid for a single bottle in CA. The duo was a gift for my stepmom and the ladies at Cardenas wrapped them up in a lovely cushioned box secured with a bow. No wrapping necessary - I love that! 

Cardenas will be my go-to for fancy pants gifts at affordable prices. And let's face it, there will probably be some presents for myself, as well."
Food,3.0,OR,"This area is a food desert in general. This is the only grocery store for quite a large area. Yes, there are many small convenience stores around, but the prices are high. The residential area surrounding this grocery store is a small pocket of nicer homes, and large stretches of lower income areas. This area was hit hard by Hurricane Katrina, but 12 years later, this is the only grocer in the near area.

Rouses is famous for being Louisiana owned and based. This location is reasonably priced. Though I don't come here often as I moved out of the area, this was my store when I did live nearby. Clean, wide aisles, inventory well stocked, clean restrooms are the pride of this location. There is on occasion a bird that is trapped inside and flies through the rafters.

The beer and wine section is quite impressive. The decorated cakes look wonderful. The deli area looks ok, though I have not purchased anything from it. They do have a wonderful section of NOLA themed items (t-shirts, earrings and the like)."
Food,4.5,OR,"I thought this place was fantastic. They have lots of cool (get it? ), unique flavors. The staff is very sweet and will let you try all the flavors you want, even if it's super busy haha (obviously don't be that person, but the staff would still be nice to you if you were). I got two scoops of key lime pie and got graham cracker crumbles on top. It was out of this world good . My partner got the Cookie Monster shake. That was super yummy, too. I just prefer hard scoops over shakes. 
There are only two benches outside for seating, so that's the reason for my 4 stars. I'd like to see them add some picnic tables or something in the area right next to the shop since we cannot currently sit inside. Once COVID is past, this place will be even more poppin than it is now once we can finally all sit down and hang out again. Very excited to have a creole creamery that I can walk to in Old Meterie."
Food,2.0,OR,"Just came from the automotive department and I'd give them minus stars if I could. We needed a tire repaired. A brand new tire that just had a small leak. First the guys looked at it and said sure they could fix it. Almost an hour later they decide we need a new tire. Not knowing that my husband is actually a mechanic they gave him some crap about how the tire is worn and we should replace it. When he said no and they realized he knows what he's talking about they changed their tune and said they would fix it. Another 15 minites go by and now they say their machine is busted and they can't fix it at all! So I said, it just broke right now? He said, nope it broke yesterday. So they had us sitting there for an hour knowing full well they couldn't help us. Now it's 5:50pm and too late to go anywhere else. I wouldn't trust these idiots to check the air in my tires let alone fix anything!"
Food,4.0,CG,"My boyfriend and I discovered this place by accident and decided to check it out. I was pretty disappointed. There was a lot of room for the kids to play, so it was pretty cramped. They had a few games to play, but it was a little loud for the kids. I had a few questions about the beer and they seemed pretty low-key. There was also a lot of seating inside, so I'm sure it was a good time. We ended up getting some pretzels to go, which were pretty good, but I'm not sure how they got them. We went back and ordered a couple of different beers, but the bartender was not very helpful and was very rude. We ended up getting two different beers, and I got one of their porter and one of their pale ales. My boyfriend really liked the IPA, but he wasn't really into the"

She had no idea what to do. I asked if she could help me and she said no. I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy. I just walked away and went to the register to go get some ice cream. I'm not sure if I'll be back, but I will be back. This is a great little local spot. The staff is friendly, and the place is laid back. We were there on a Saturday night, and there was a huge selection of beers and wine. We were also able to get a few bottles of wine, as well as a bottle of wine."
Food,5.0,CG,"Finally! New Orleans has a nice selection of local craft beer, but I didn't find a single beer that I didn't like. The guys behind the bar were friendly and helpful. The place is small and there is a good amount of seating. If you're looking for a good beer with a good vibe, this is the place to go. I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and was not disappointed! I chose the cake for my husband's birthday party, and it was delicious! I had the white chocolate raspberry, but he liked the red velvet. The cake was moist and delicious. The staff were friendly, and the cake was delicious. They have a wide variety of flavors, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique cake for an occasion. If you're looking for a little sweet treat, this is the place to go."
Food,4.0,OR,"I had been to a different location back when I lived somewhere else and I just learned this week that there was a local Produce Junction.

This location is small, but their prices are great. They sell fruits and vegetables in pre-weighed bags so you can't buy a single piece. They also keep most of the produce behind a counter so you can't always look before you buy. The prices are really low compared to the grocery stores.

They also sell flowers for a great price. A dozen roses cost $4 today (July 6, 2013) and they had other nice bouquets for between $2 and $6 depending on the size. The flowers are in the front of the store and you can look at each bouquet.

The only bad part of this location is the parking. It's right off the street and while they have a few spots in front, you'd have to back up into incoming traffic to leave. Or you can park on the street itself. I had no problem finding a place to park, but it wasn't the best."
Food,4.5,OR,"I love all the World Markets I've been in (okay, I think that's only maybe 2, or 3 max) but this one is the best because the customer service is just fantastic. For example, a friend recently asked me to pick up a teapot for her because she doesn't live nearby, but found one she wants online and it said it was in stock. So I went and looked around for it, but this teapot wasn't to be found in the teapot area. An employee walked by and asked if he could help me find something, so I showed him the picture and unit number I was looking for. He spent a good 15 minutes looking through boxes trying to find the right color she wanted, aqua, but could only find red ones, and apologized several times. I went ahead and got a red one, not a huge deal, but it is rare to find such great customer service. I've been several other times just to browse around, as well - it's a great store for adorable gifts, too."
Food,4.5,OR,"Visited with 6 friends in 2016. Found a great Groupon deal so decided to return with a group of 5 completely different friends so they could experience the tour. One friend had completed the tour on a separate trip but still agreed to come because, like me, she enjoyed the tour that much!

I didn't remember much of anything from the last tour so it was like doing it for the first time. The guide was sarcastic and entertaining, and doubled as our shuttle driver to and from the French Quarter. The tour shed light on the distilling and bottling process, as well as some New Orleans history. I would go again if I was visiting with friends who were interested. The Amber was my favorite and if I had space in my luggage I would've purchased! They will ship to you, so that's a plus.

The one and only downside is most of the tour takes place in open air so if it's freezing outside, or hell-hot, you will feel it. So check the weather and dress accordingly if possible!"
Food,4.5,CG,"Stopped by one winter afternoon--we had an amazing time! We loved the history of the building and the different ways that we had to visit. There were some great activities, so it was a nice place to take a few pictures. We will definitely be back!Very friendly staff. The staff is always extremely helpful and nice. I recommend checking out the new bistro location next door. We love this place. I love the atmosphere and the music. It's very fun to watch the music playing. You can see the brewing process, which is very cool. There's a huge selection of beers. The staff is super friendly and they have a great selection of beers. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique beer to try. This is a great bakery!  I have been looking for a bakery for a while."

I don't think they have a drive-thru option, but it's a good option if you're just getting a quick pick-me-up.I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite is the strawberry cake, but the carrot cake is my favorite! Their red velvet cake is also a must try. They also have a lot of vegan options!

I always get a free scoop of the salted caramel and it's a perfect summer treat!I've been to this store a few times. I love that they have a parking lot in front and a couple other spots.

I have no complaints about this store.
Food,4.5,OR,"FRESHLY SOURCED.

^ Honestly the best thing I can say is the first two words. I've tried many boba places & most are full of syrups, powders, artificial enhancers and just overall lacking. 

Tea lounge is not lacking at all in flavor or texture. I would try any and everything on their tea menu and I'm not the most adventurous. I believe they have food and ice cream here as well but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet. 

I think the selection of popping boba is the only thing I would actually critique, as they only have 2!  Aside from that, all of the jellys, crystal boba and tapioca bobas are yummy.  They are also on the higher end of pricing. 

I would say between the two states I reside in - this one is the best. I do have to drive a bit out of the way for it but that's fine with me. 

Verdict: 
Don't hesitate, go forth and experience some boba. 
Suggestion: 
Get the Taro+Coconut Milk tea with tapioca boba and mango poppers! Mmmm."
Food,3.5,OR,"Went to this Starbucks today through the drive thru since there was no where to park. It wasn't a busy time either. 

I order my drink and there was only one car ahead. When I get to the window, I pay and I am given my drink. It's a typical paper cup with lid but coffee has been dripping out on the sides. It's messy and sticky. And I notice it was not the size I ordered (Venti). I hand in back and tell them, and he takes my drink back- within a minute I have a new drink. 

I have to rush off back to college at that point and I am not really expecting much from my drink. But when I get to school and I open the lid, I notice the drink wasn't at the top. Instead it started over 2 inches down. 

Did they really do that? Make me the wrong size and when I complained just put my drink in a bigger cup so I would shut up? Looks like they did that too me."
Food,4.0,OR,"Stopped in here after dinner recently. We bought a dozen cookies for $12. The variety we chose included: 4 chocolate chunk, 2 snickerdoodle, 2 sugar, 2 m&m, and 2 oatmeal raisin. 

The people working at Insomnia are laid back and friendly. I watched the girl fill a box as we selected our order; the cookies flopped warmly, softly, pliably. We received our box of cookies like a couple receiving a newly adopted baby into their arms. The box emanated sugary warmth. 

As we left, cookies secured with our leftovers, I saw an Insomnia employee get on his bike with boxes in satchel. After walking and the train, we arrived at home. The cookies had cooled somewhat into contorted shapes after the travel. I wonder how cookies that are delivered arrive?

It matters not, though! For these cookies (I'd guess 3-3.5"" diameter) were delicious, even the ones we ate a day or two later. I'd pass on the oatmeal raisin next time, but they were still good. 

Now if only they had sugar-free cookies for my guy when it's not his birthday..."

Food,4.5,OR,"Ugh man I used to really love this place and thought it was even better than McConnells, but I've noticed recently that it has gone downhill for me. Kind of embarrassed now that I've even hyped it up to some of my friends now.

The prices have gone up... $4.15 for the smallest scoop ever!! 6+ for a double scoop geezus... 

The customer service is also very unhappy and unfriendly the past few times I've been, which makes it another downer.

Flavors that were once magnificent to me were 1. Strawberry cheesecake 2. Honey almond crunch 3. Malted milk ball

The strawberry cheesecake was once out of this world but I've found it to be inconsistent lately with the cheesecake parts being freezer burned/icy which throws off the rest of the ice cream. I know this is quality ice cream, but either the prices need to go down a bit or the portion needs to make up for it to continue having me/others as a frequent customer! Along with the service too. How could you not be happy surrounded by this heavenly smelling place?!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Oh man. Another tasty sugar cream pie under the belt....err, on the bottom. 

This places is cute as a button. From the small shop space off of Zionsville's main drag to the smell of pies wafting down the street, My Sugar Pie is the kind of business you take out-of-town friends to give them a taste of Hoosier flavor and hospitality. 

Not only are they loved in the Yelpisphere but in large-scale magazines like Midwest Living and beyond. 

Now you're asking about the flavors?
Well, I say go for the sugar cream pie (what they're most famous for), but there's also Dutch Apple, Lemon Meringue and seasonal fruit pies. Important note: they ship! Great option for the holidays and birthdays. I plan to send one to a few of my coworkers in the near future. 

Last, but not least, pies are sold whole and by the slice. Expect to pay $3-$4 per slice. Oh! And you'll find My Sugar Pie on the menu at St.Elmo Steakhouse downtown (for those of us downtown dwellers who can't wait for our next visit to Zionsville)."

First of all it was an adventure just trying to wedge into the parking lot without being run over by cars flying into and out of spaces.  Walking from the car to the store was the next gauntlet! 
 No easy task.  But I must say I have never seen more people in one store in my life!  It was chaos.  Bedlam.  The store is big.  My son loves to shop there.  Once was enough for me.  They had several wine tastings going on which was nice and we found most of what we were looking for that trip.  The store however was trashed and lots of bins were empty.  The staff was scurrying to restock but those shoppers were like a hoard of locusts.  It was an experience.  I will just say liquor shoppers in Delaware mean business.

Food,3.5,OR,"Hubby and I were here this past Sunday afternoon. He ordered a large, hot soy cappuccino and for me a medium, hot caramel latte. Usually, I request the caramel sauce, because the caramel liquid flavoring often tends to leave a weird artificial aftertaste. The barista was super sweet, and informed me that they don't have caramel sauce. Drat! Well then, artificial caramel liquid thingy it is! My latte was AMAZING! And usually, I hate almost everyone's lattes because there tends to be too much milk and it often turns out to be coffee tinted milk instead. (Seriously, if the latte looks like vanilla chai, and it is NOT a vanilla chai latte, that means there is TOO MUCH MILK! Sorry, some coffee makers just don't respect the espresso/ milk ratio!) 

Anyway, the barista did a great job with both of our drinks. (And that's a HUGE compliment since both Hubby and I are both coffee snobs.) The prices were also decent at about $8. We pay $13 at Starbucks during coffee emergencies for crappier versions. Yes, I said it! Starbucks = crap."

It's a cute, tiny spot that seems good for getting a few hours of work done or even just chilling. The crowd when I walked in was mixed, it included a man busy at his computer as well as a mom & her child enjoying breakfast. A couple others came in and out while I was ordering as well. 

I was really impressed with the beautifully crafted ""Lucky Goat"" latte I ordered...Dark chocolate, hazelnut, sea salt! It was delicious The barista was also patient and nice as I looked over what to order. I would definitely be back to try the other special drinks which all sounded amazing or try some of the fresh baked pastries. I'm also curious about the iced coffee.

One suggestion I'd have is for them to update their website! The website still lists fall specials and I know they have a couple of new drink specials every season! I'll be back soon to try more items off the menu!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Decided to try another new brewery, S.Y.C. Brewing Co., in town. It's located in the industrial hood of the west end. The only landmark to me in this area is ATHX Performance.

We dropped in on a Friday evening (around 6:00pm). You order at the counter and can start a tab. Vibes are chill and there's an upstairs with a few games (uno and cribbage) and a projector (with the hockey game on). 

There were 11 beers on tap along with two snacks (sausages and Zwick's pretzels). Cans are pricey ($18.00 to $22.00 for 4). A bit sad that there's a few flavours you can't taste.

- Pretzel ($3.00) - nice touch that they heat up your pretzel. It comes with a side of Dijon mustard.
- Flight ($10.00 for 4) - we decided to try nuages (table saison), lunar phase (farmhouse pale ale), sandy beach (American pale ale) and pineapple F.O.M.O. (kettle sour). None of the beers were particularly interesting or unique but the pineapple kettle sour was the best of the bunch. 

Standard beers but at least the vibes are chill at SYC."

+ Local baked goodies
+ Best croissant selection in STL!!! 

This is my favorite coffee place in STL. The coffee is superb, the baristas know exactly what to whip up or suggest to your tastes, and the pastry/baked goods selection is out of this world. Their coffees are quality single origin beans that are super fresh and brewed using a V60 pour-over. So your order will take 5+ minutes to make so this is not a place to go if you're in a hurry trying to just get your drip coffee on-the-go. The baristas seem very passionate about their craft and offer tips and suggestions and educate on the available selection without being pretentious or pushy at the slightest.

And let me tell you about the pastries. Especially the CROISSANTS. I've had two of the best croissants pretty much... *in my life* here at Comet Coffee. Their CHOCOLATE CROISSANT is buttery, flaky, perfect. They also have a HAM & CHEESE CROISSANT with lonza and Camembert cheese from Salume Beddu.

Their Chorizo is made with beef and is more amazing than any other Chorizo I've ever had in my life. The steaks and ground beef are equally amazing. 

Bring lots of cash, it does go quick, although there is an ATM in the Plaza which is convenient. And a visit to the Sunday Farmer's Market wouldn't be complete without a stop at the Planet of the Crepes Truck. If you like them on Facebook you can see what their special is before you drive over there.

Food,3.5,OR,"I paid about $175 for a bunch of groceries and noticed that a $10 bottle of mouthwash wasn't in my bags when I got home.  A couple of days later, after giving my car a thorough search, I went back to Publix with my receipt and told the woman at customer service that the one item was missing.  She looked in a book and then whispered to the older woman next to her.  That woman then took charge.  She said to me, ""Ok we'll take care of it this one time.""   
THIS ONE TIME?  
No, every single time your staff bags my groceries and doesn't include an item I paid for in my bags, you will take care of it.  How dare she imply that I'm a thief or scammer?   
I got my mouthwash and left.  
In the future, if I ever shop there again, I will carefully pack my own groceries and never allow their staff to handle anything I paid for.  
I'm still wondering what was in the book."

It's a little pricey for a brewery, but worth it. They have a food truck outside, and it's a great place to bring your dog. They have a food truck outside as well, as it is on the way back from the main strip. The brewery is very small, but it's a great place to hang out. You can bring your dog, or bring your own food.

When I called to get a credit I was in a head on confrontation with the owner (who came out with nails bared!) she was incredibly rude and condescending as if we were lying about the missing box.  Never have I been treated so badly from any store owner in my life and had such a negative experience.  She emailed me saying I could buy another box and they would ship it!  Just wanted a credit for what we didn't receive when our order was picked up!  Never got a reply or phone call to rectify the situation.  This person needs to stay in the kitchen with her chocolates and have someone who is customer friendly and professional represent her brand!

It's cheap, we get it, we move on, right?

Today I stopped in to get some anti-freeze to keep in my trunk and grabbed a Cosmo mag while I was at the check out. I didn't think any thing of the total until later when I was unpacking and took a quick glance at the receipt. 

I was getting ready to toss it when I realized the price on the mag and the price on the receipt (Wow, Cosmo got expensive! ....wait....)were two different ones...and they had charged me more than the mag was being sold for!

So I immediately took it back to the store and asked for a refund. The 3 stars is for the fact that they returned it with no issues, but I had to drive the 15 minutes back to the store to return it. Turns out they had charged me almost a full extra dollar (with tax, etc) than the magazine's actual price!

I don't recall her name, but the customer service manager who's missing about 3 teeth in the front of her mouth must be the most disgusting and miserable being I've ever encountered. We needed a receipt to return and item we purchased at a different Walmart in Price, UT on our road trip -- I contacted the Walmart in Price and they said they would be more than willing to fax over our receipt to this location in Reno, NV and that it would be no issue at all to make our return. This miserable, toothless customer service manager at the Kietzke location refused to accept a faxed receipt from the Walmart in Price, UT even though their manager said there would be no issue with it at all. Maybe she was having a bad day, or she's just angry that she's missing 3 teeth and has a bad dye job. Either way, she is totally useless and I can't believe Walmart refused to return and item with a faxed receipt from one of their other stores."

I wish there were shops like this one, so at least there competitive pricing or something. However, there is none like the Lil' Pop Shop, only the Pop Shop itself.

This is the only place you get flavors like earl grey tea with pepper on a popsicle. The only chef crazy enough to make stuff like garden mint and mochi green tea frozen on a stick. Whatever you feel like trying, it will be good. You see? This place is dangerous, it borderline unhealthy addictions. One pop will never be enough. The popsicles here are creamy, flavorful with the right amount of sweet and exotic. 

With so many dessert places popping up, it can be jarring to find a truly unique spot. With the Lil Pop Shop, you know for sure you will get that one of a kind experience, just make sure you work a Lil extra before heading over!"
Food,3.5,OR,"Just an update to my original review from 2008. This store continues to baffle me as to how they can possibly stay in business. The store still seems grossly overstaffed. the prices defy reason. Most times they charge much more then high end stores such as Whole Foods etc. and they seem to produce too much perishable food (Food that must be sold within a day or so or it will spoil). I read where others compare this store to Wegman's or Whole Foods. Not even close. This place is closer to the former Genuardi line. Now if you really want a stealth high end store, great prices, beautiful clean interior, friendly employees, lots of gourmet choices etc. try the Shop Rite just a few miles away on Forty Food road. Shop Rite??  I know the image. That is why I avoided going in for a few years. Trust me!!!!!! Try it. IT BLOWS AWAY HENNINGS BIG TIME IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. Thank me later."

It's a pretty big place, so it has a  decent selection of most things.  They have a moderate selection of Belgian beers and American craft breweries. They are also well stocked in hard liquors (which I think might sometimes be slightly cheaper here than the bigger chains).   Also, if you can't find what you want, they will order it for you.. you just have to ask the manager nicely. 

This, like any other liquor store, is definitely a place to avoid right before major drinking holidays (new years, halloween, christmas, football games).  On several occasions, I've driven past and seen police directing traffic in the parking lot.  That's a sign of two sure things... they're well liked and busy, and also have really crummy parking!

So our drinks were already in a tray and she TOOK IT OUT OF THE TRAY to give to me! I'm one person with two hands and it was hard for me to carry the drinks but she did not offer me the tray to make it easier on my end. This is my first time so I asked her how can I identify which drink was which? She did not say a word, just looked at me and turned the cup around so I can see the label.

The breakfast sandwich was soggy and I can get over all that but the gal at the window WAS SO UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE.

To tell you the truth I use Shipt and have my groceries delivered cause it is just SO much easier but if I do have a rare trip to the store this is the one I go too. 

It is the cleanest Publix I know of, the staff is super friendly and helpful. I am always asked at least 3 to 4 times per shopping trip if there is anything I need help with. I am sure the location and usual clientele okay into this. The seafood counter is always full of a wide variety of seafood, it's mimics the seafood counter at Whole Foods. The meat department has a great selection, a lot of which is organic and hormone free. I also really like the olive and cheese section.

I haven't had the opportunity to visit the upstairs for a dine-in experience yet, but maybe I'll make time for this one day soon. I hear great things about the sandwiches and salads here.

The event is a well run machine. The Brewers Guild of Indiana recruits volunteers, people like you and me to help make this event run smoothly. It features only Indiana breweries. Each brewer brings several of their beers for tasting. For one small fee participants get the opportunity to taste over 50 beers if they choose.  

Additionally, you can bring your snacks. One caveat, it has to be worn around your neck. Literally, you must make a necklace out of your food. People gets crazy. Check out some of the photos. 

Microbrewers know how to put on a festival. It's four hours of non stop fun. This is an event that I will surely be a volunteer for years to come if they have me.

Food,4.0,OR,"The name sounds like a hack of Nintendo's famous franchise. Eat some mushroom curry and grow in stature! Grab a curry leaf and sprout a tail! I always knew Mario was a vegetarian.

Super Patel Bros. is a chain of Indian groceries stores. They sell fresh spices/fruit/vegetables, packaged meals, snacks, rice/flour, and frozen entrees and desserts. The store is generally clean. 

If you are a vegetarian, you could probably manage going here for all your grocery needs. Their produce and spices are really cheap (especially compared to Publix and even Walmart at times). 

I don't go often but some of the items I like are:

Haldiram's Hara Chiwda snack mix (curried rice krispies, golden raisins, and cashews)
Bourbon chocolate biscuits(a  rectangular sandwich cookie with chocolate cream)
Various frozen kebabs
Frozen Samosas with spinach and cheese (green/purple packaging)

Cons:

Many of the dry goods are kept long past their expiration date. This isnt Publix where they update inventory frequently. Check before you buy.

The aisles are very narrow. Prepare to do a lot of squeezing.

Some of the frozen items are a bit overpriced (especially meats and frozen dinners)

Overall: A good place to get your Indian foodstuffs."
Food,4.5,OR,"Well well well so I visited the Wellington Bookstore and coffee shop. What can be said --lots! 

This hidden gem offers a cozy serene atmosphere filled with shelves of books, displays of artifacts, and abundance of antiques. I absolutely love it. If you follow my coffee shop reviews you know I test the quality of coffee through the taste and flavor in which a mocha latte is made. Let's just say the coffee was nice and the atmosphere was great. We were greeted pleasantly as soon as we walked in the door.

This spot has nooks and crannies to sit, chat, and read. Not really ideal for working it's more of a social atmosphere because the seating spaces are open but intimate. All this surrounded by books, gifts, and options to satisfy your sweet tooth.  If you want a cozy comfortable atmosphere to think, chat, or simply be alone this lovely book store and coffee shop will meet your needs. Order a beverage, buy a gift, read a book, or simply meditate in this calm positive environment while meeting up with friends. There is something for everyone here."
Food,4.5,OR,"I didn't think an ice cream place could live up to the hype, but it DID. 

Pros: Servings are big. My husband and I shared one, which was $6.50 after tax. However, ""one"" is actually two scoops, and you can even make them different flavors. I wasn't expecting this, but they actually came in a cup and were slightly blended/mixed together. That made it hard to know which was which, but it was a nice touch and kind of made it better. We definitely would've been sick if we had EACH had a separate cup full.

Cons: The wait was loooong. While waiting in line, we also tried to order online, but they never called our name (even when the expected time passed). When we got to the front, we asked about the online order. They saw it in their system, and said that they didn't carry either of the flavors we had ordered, so we had to change! That's crazy, because if we hadn't of been waiting in line, we would have wasted a lot of time as they would've NEVER called our name for the online order!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Stopped by McConnell's Ice Cream last week, and it was alright. I am a huge ice cream fan, but this ice cream just wasn't that special.

My boyfriend and I tried the Brazilian Coffee Chip and the Vegan Almond Frozen Yogurt. The ice cream was..boring? It wasn't super sweet, but it wasn't very flavorful either. The yogurt was refreshing but also lacked flavor. 

Prices: The prices seem quite high, but you do get a lot for one scoop (or for a small frozen yogurt). I'm glad we both got the smallest options, as they were plenty for us to share.

Parking: Expect to park on the street.

Ambiance: McConnell's feels like it is a Santa Barbara institution/landmark; it is so pricey but that doesn't stop the line from going out the door. The patio area is small. When we were there, a snooty family had ""saved"" half of the patio tables by tying a dog to one of the table's legs, and then moved to a different set of tables later...so that kind of disturbed our experience too. 

Overall, I wouldn't bother going back the next time I'm in the area."

If you want to treat your customers with respect, you should not be there.Great coffee, friendly staff, good vibes, and great music! 

I would definitely recommend this place to any coffee lover!I was looking for a place to get a cake for my daughter's birthday and I found this place. I was so excited to see the new bakery in my neighborhood. I think they have a bakery in the back. It's a little pricey, but I thought the cake was great. I wish they had more options, but that's not really the case here."
Food,5.0,CG,"Yesterday was my first visit to this bakery. It was a little disappointing that there was no one to speak to.  The bakery itself was very small, and the inside was very small.  The staff seemed very overwhelmed.   The shop was very clean and the staff was very friendly.   I ended up going with a blueberry fritter with a raspberry frosting.  It was very good.   The strawberry filling was good, but I would prefer the strawberry filling to the frosting.  The cake was really moist and had a nice cake.  

I will be back for sure.  

I do recommend to anyone looking for a dessert place.  They have a small selection of cakes, and they are very affordable.

Food,4.0,OR,"I used to live in Santa Barbara, and I'm happy to see some changes are for the better.  The area where Pali Wine is located used to be all warehouses, and it's nice to see the different wineries and bars popping up there.

Pali Wine has delicious wines where you can buy bottles, or on tap!  I did their pinot noir tastings, and was impressed with every one I tried.  I ordered a bottle for myself, and I'm not going to wait for a special occasion to open it.

Prices are reasonable too! Because I was with members, my tasting was free, but it would have been waived anyway because I bought a bottle. And the bottle was no more than $25.

The staff is friendly, and the space is modern.  There's a patio where you can bring your own food while doing the tastings.

And on the particularly hot day in Santa Barbara, during Fiesta no less, being inside with the AC blasting was a lifesaver.

It's places like this that make me miss living in Santa Barbara.  I will definitely take my friends there when I return."
Food,4.5,OR,"Any place that gives away this much free beer is awesome in my book. The tours get filled pretty quickly so try to plan in advance. The most in-depth tour is the brewmaster, which is 2 hrs long with lots of tasting ($35). Well worth it given the souvenirs and drinks.

They have a regular brewery tour as well, which is free, and yes also includes free beer! They take you out to the stables to see the regal Clydesdales and then through the various buildings to show the beer making process. A 45 minute commitment, well worth the time. Tour guides are fun and it is pretty relaxed. There is outdoor walking, so it can get a tad miserable in the rain. 

Tours end at the biergarten- nice area- lots of seating. There is happy hour from 4-7 with nicely priced beer and appetizers. They also sometimes have live music which is also pretty fun. 

Parking is simple and easy- ample space available. Would definitely go again.

Overall my experience was good! The staff was friendly, the environment was clean and well kept, and they did have a few selections to choose from. 

I personally ordered a Halloween vanilla doughnut, and a chocolate chip cupcake. I loved the doughnut! Like who doesn't love yummy doughnuts right ?! But this one I felt was a little bit more on the cakie side ( if that makes any sense ) but still really good in taste and the frosting on top was not overwhelming... it was just right and a plus it brought the cutest little vampire teeth lol  ( it's Halloween time). Now as far as the cupcake ... I wasn't too impressed. Now don't get me wrong it was good, but it looked even better! 

I overall think that the presentation on everything I saw was very nice and the environment itself is perfect."
Food,4.5,OR,"For a long time this has been my favorite brewery in the downtown area.

I fell in love with the preacher's daughter years ago, don't tell anyone.

Their seasonals are really where it's at.  Being a heavier beer drinker, I am a huge fan of their hop your face. It is a solid Double IPA that has a great hop flavor that doesn't cut your palate.  Also, their count nibula chocolate stout is top notch for an easier drinking stout.  Also, the 12-21 stout from last year was one of a kind (please bring it back!)

I'm very pleased they added the soul ride IPA to their standards line up.  It was the big hole in their line up.  They ended up making the seasonal a regular which was greatly appreciated.  

The staff is always very accommodating and makes you feel like they appreciate your business.  

The atmosphere is also chill, an amazing place to have a conversation.  

Finally, the open food policy is great.  You can score food from a food truck, or you can bring in take out if you like."

Selection and variety: Top notch! Prepared foods include salads, pastas, sandwiches and sushi from sushi bros. Other snacks include a variety of produce, cheese, ice cream, crackers, chocolates and more! 

Drinks; full refrigerator section with gourmet sodas, juice and flavored teas. Additionally, a wide wine offering, beer and liquor selections.

Surprises; the market has a full coffee bar and breakfast selections including bagels (toasted on site), hard boiled eggs, muffins, gourmet butters etc.

Non edibles; the market also carries seasonal items like hats, sunscreen and other summer necessities. Since the market is neighbor to several cbd apartment buildings, they carry paper goods, otc medicine, hygiene supplies, pet food and daily needs.

Atmosphere; a patio out front with four umbrella covered tables provides a nice oasis to eat lunch, read the paper and enjoy the outdoors.

Looking forward to my next visit and what other discoveries await me!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I am typically a fruity ice cream girl but the Beard of Bees intrigued me and I had to give it a try. Honey ice cream with almonds? Honey comb bits? It was insanely creamy with that stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth finish. I ordered it with the house made whipped cream which was a nice touch! 

All of the flavors looked delicious and the sandwiches are adorable and beautifully crafted. I'm not entirely sure how a picky eater or child would fare in a place like this, but if you're open to trying interesting and well made flavors, this is the place to do it! 

The prices are a bit high- $4.75 for one scoop, $7 for 2, $5 for a sandwich, but if you're going for something decadent like this, you really do not need anything more than 1 scoop (imo) and you're paying for top quality. 

Compared to Little Baby's, I'd say Wecklerys is a little more refined. Less crazy flavors and more fancy ones. Almost similar to the Bent Spoon in Princeton? 

The service was excellent, the two women at the counter were friendly and helpful.

I will be coming back!"
Food,4.0,OR,"We stopped in on a Sunday just to check the place out, and to price a beef roast for Christmas against Whole Foods. Once I'd had enough wandering the local goods in the back and ogling the cheese in the Bloomy Rind case, I made my way to the counter to discuss special ordering my sirloin roast. No problem, they said. Along with boning the meat, they offered to tie the roast back to the bone so it could cook with flavors from the bone. Great suggestion, and one I wouldn't have necessarily thought to ask for, so I decided on the spot to give my business to the local butcher over Whole Foods. 

While we were there, we spied veal steaks - something that is quite difficult to find in Nashville - and snatched them up. The cut was tremendously tender.  We trusted the origin enough to prepare them on the rarer side, which was the best way to truly taste the meat itself. 

We'll be back next week to pick up our beautiful roast, and a couple of bones for a couple of spoiled dogs. I'm impressed."

The only thing I wish they would change is the hours. I would love to see more hours. I have to come back and try the breakfast sandwiches! I think they're all made by the owner, but I think they're made by someone who knows a lot of coffee. 

They also offer a coffee menu. You can order a muffin, coffee, and a bagel. 

Overall, I'd say it's worth a stop!I stopped in here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. I went in to pick up a few things for a baby shower and it was clean, organized, and well-stocked. There were about 6 people in the store and the cashier was very pleasant and helpful."

Food,4.0,OR,"Every beer imaginable. Let's just leave it at that....

...ok, you want more? We can start at the beginning then, with the entrance and the decor which is eccentric and fun. It sets this place apart from other bars in Soulard and gives you a preview of what to expect on tap--also eccentric and fun. Be sure to check out the beer tap fountain in the beer garden.

Next up--the beers. Take a long look at the list and then tell your server what you like and they will guide you. If you can't choose, I love the Kwak beer and this is one of the only places in STL to try it.

Finally food. There is none. So head through the door in the middle of the bar that leads into Epic. Order a fabulous slice of pizza or an even better burger then head back to your table in I-Tap and they will deliver it to you. I promise you will not be disappointed.

Next time you need a place to watch the game or need to impress your beer friends make a visit to iTap and let your inner beer-child go wild!"

In reading the reviews, I find that I am experiencing what everyone else is:  promises to deliver that never materialized, unanswered phone calls, unanswered emails, partial shipments, refusal to adhere to basic customer service standards.  I ordered from them because of their high rating for palatability, and it is, truly, the only raw food my guys will eat.  I ordered 10 lbs of the duck recipe and 10 lbs of the rabbit recipe.  The duck came;  the rabbit did not.  I immediately emailed, and ""Eileen"" responded, assuring me she would re-send the rabbit;  oh, and by the way, I could also get a huge discount on a second order if I ordered right away (sale going off), so, like a fool, I did.  She got me for a HUGE amount.  Nothing ever arrived.

Plan on strolling with family on a Saturday, after dinner or riding your bike to Harley's on Pinellas Trail. Dunedin has a wide variety of restaurants, but is lacking on younger age treats, outside of the popular ice cream store.  Parents can enjoy the atmosphere of Main Street more if the younger ones are happy.  Gives everyone a snack to munch while people watching.   

We purchased the bags of Dunedin Mix $6 and Beer Cheese $6 pop corn.   Great flavors for adults, but Harley's has plenty of sweet flavors.  They have on-line orders for party's and special events with props and pop corn bags to match.  From unicorn to football themes, this is an inexpensive way to decorate without with easy clean up.

I told them I didn't want to drink a medium and they told me it was a medium. I asked for a medium and they gave me a small. I said that I was going to just pour a medium and it was a medium. When I was done with the drink, I asked for a medium and I was told it was a medium. I went back to the counter to ask for a medium and was told it was $6. I was shocked that I was given a medium.

If you are looking for a quick place to go to the restroom check one of the neighboring places.  Toilet paper, check-ish, spare roll was on the floor next to the two plungers (why does a yogurt shop need two plungers?) Soap, check-ish, there was a bottle of liquidy stuff on the sink top that said soap.  Hand towels, check-ish, if you like going out to the counter to ask for towels to dry your hands then for sure a big fat check.  Otherwise, not so much.  The two girls running the show are probably more than capable, but I'm not fond of a ""OMG, not another customer"" attitude as I patronize a place.  Why two stars you say?

IF you are able to choose when you can shop you can avoid a lot of the crowding and noise issues.   I shop between 0600-0700 on Saturday or Sunday.  Yeah it sucks to get up early on the weekend, but after a stop at Starbucks for some liquid sunshine I can walk into Winco, put on my Ipod and shop my little heart out without the lines and the squalling children.  Yeah, you gotta dodge the folks stocking the shelves but hey some of them are cute, and they aren't running into you with carts or testing the decible levels of their lungs. 

DO NOT buy anything more than basic produce at Winco.. go to Fred Meyer which has better quality and the prices aren't as high as Albertson.  Go to Albertsons for MEAT.

Food,4.5,OR,"Aw, the SAOFM! (Even though no one calls it that.)

I grew up in St. Albert (or Stalbert, or St. A) so I'm pretty familiar with this market, which just happens to be the largest in Western Canada. My hometown's claim to fame, I suppose.

Picture any other market in Edmonton. Doesn't really matter which one. Terwillegar, Callingwood, Strathcona, even Downtown, which I think is a pretty substantial market. SAOFM blows them all outta the organic, locally sourced water. From one end of St. Anne street to the other, I always find myself walking the market twice through - once to visit booths on the east side of the street, and once to visit west side booths.

The best part about this market is deal hunting. There's not just one or two booths selling ripe tomatoes, but close to a dozen. Same goes for peaches, lettuce, and meats. Plus crafts, handcarved wood, pies, meat pies, a balloon artist, and of course, the strawberry popsicle lady.

You won't do efficient grocery shopping here, especially if you intend to run back and forth between stalls to price check, but on a gorgeous day out, it's the perfect family-friendly activity."
Food,4.0,OR,"We went to Dough last Friday night and ordered a cupcake, a maple bacon doughnut, and 2 macarons. The macarons were FROZEN in the middle and did not taste like the flavors they said there were. It was supposed to be a coffee macaron and a PB & J macaron but both flavors could not be tasted in either.

The cupcake was nothing special either. The cake part was good but we tossed out the frosting because it was hard and bland. 

The maple bacon doughnut was really good, probably the best thing we had there. The combination of maple and bacon on a doughnut is genius! We asked if it was filled with anything before we ordered it and was told that it wasn't filled. Imagine our ""surprise"" after a few bites in when we realized it WAS indeed filled...with boston creme. 

The chances of us coming back here are slim but if we do, we'll probably only get the doughnut because that seems to be the best thing on their menu...we'll just have to make sure we double check with more than one person working there to make sure it's not filled."

1) You must have a membership to access a majority of the space. WTF? Half of the fun of Maryland House was hanging out in the different rooms, which led to very interesting conversations. 

2) The staff, including the bartenders and bouncers, were especially douchy. The decor and overall vibe of the space does not mesh well with backwards hats or old school KSwiss tennies. Bad staffing choice. And they're not nice!

3) My drink, the Perfect Fit, was God awful. It's supposed to be blood orange juice with some other liqueurs. They served me a $10 screwdriver, made with rail vodka and in a tiny glass. Gross.

If I wanted cheaper frozen concoctions with 15-20 ingredients and (mostly) not cared for cows then the other guys would be the ticket.  

The ingredients here are few, simple and super delicious.     Today they had a new flavor (to me) Peanut Butter and Prickly Pear Jam (PB&J).  I got a pint of that and had to try their #1 seller the Sweet Cream Honeycomb ... fantastic!!   You can of course sample any of their flavors.  Every employee (including the owners) are great at customer service and making you feel welcome to be there."
Food,4.0,OR,"I reviewed Brews at the Beach last year and gave them four stars.   They did better this year.   I am not sure but it seemed like this year they had a few more Breweries.   My absolute favorite was Indian Wells Whiskey Barrel!   Loved that beer so glad I didn't discover it until the end of the day if you know what I mean!  

For the IPA fans they should have been in IPA heaven, seemed to be an IPA festival more than a beer festival.   

The food might have improved just a touch as well.  Giovanni's pizza, two slices for $5.   They also had burritos and Tri Tip.   This year they allowed people to bring in their own food if they wanted as well. 

And everyone's biggest complaint last year was the excessive bathroom lines, no problem this year, I think they had four times the capacity and the lines were no longer than a couple of minutes.   

Great event!   $35 last year $40 this year, hope that it doesn't go up next year."

The food is always great and the location is a perfect place to enjoy a beer. It was a lot of fun to watch the line go up and down the street. I've had the cheesecake ice cream, peanut butter, and salted caramel. All were delicious. I got the chocolate chunk, which is a vanilla ice cream. I'm not a big ice cream fan but I had a lot of fun. They have a variety of ice cream flavors to choose from, and I like that they're open late. I went with the dark chocolate caramel and it was a nice mix of dark chocolate and caramel. It's a nice little place to get some ice cream. It's not a bad place to go."
Food,4.0,CG,"If you know me at all, you know what you're missing. The fruit and veggies here are top-notch, and they're fresh and tasty. The prices are a bit high, but the quality is worth it. The customer service is always excellent. They have a decent selection of fruit and veggies, but the last time I went there was a bad experience. I went there with my sister and it was on a Saturday afternoon. I was not greeted by anyone. I felt very rushed, and I felt rushed, which is why I was just here for a few minutes. Overall, I'll be back, but I'm not a fan of the produce. I'm a huge fan of La Colombe Coffee. It's a small coffee shop, with a variety of drinks, from simple syrup, to syrup. There are so many drinks to choose from that you can really taste the difference in their flavors."
Food,4.5,CG,"Disclaimer: I have not set foot in the market, and I will not be buying anything from them. I had a friend from out of town, and wanted to take her to this market. I went to the market, and they had some vendors selling vendors selling some local items. We picked up some fresh fruit and some things, and we were able to buy some breads. I was quite disappointed with the quality of the produce. It was all a little overpriced, and it was quite expensive for what I expected. I felt like they were having a great sale. I am really sad that this market doesn't have a lot of vendors that I want to go to. I would think that I would get better quality produce at the market, and I would have loved to find some other vendors. I hope that I get to see what the market is doing, but I have not seen the vendors in the market."
Food,5.0,OR,"What a twist on cupcakes?!! I didn't think you could do anything else to change the cupcake-but I was wrong! Nothin Bundt cakes nails it!! Their mini cakes are absolutely delicious!!! Their recipe is probably one of the best I've ever tasted. Their cakes are delicious, moist and you can get them in several different flavors. The ones I know of are:
Lemon
Raspberry (I think it's raspberry champagne or raspberry cheesecake)
Chocolate and 
Red velvet (my personal fav).

You really can't go wrong with any of them. Even though I don't eat chocolate cake-their chocolate wasn't terrible. And I absolutely loves that their frosting is whipped. Oooo so good! They have coordinated frosting to match the cakes. Not sure if you can change that up. Might be available for special order.

There are a variety of sizes also. They actually have full sized Bundt cakes, (8""-10""), bundtlets and bundtinis (only by the dozen). From what I can see, you just grab most and go. If you have a special event, you may want to call ahead to double check quantity availability. But I'm telling you what, these will be my new go-to for quick treats for friends and family."
Food,4.5,OR,"As probably my favorite Florida Brewery, you can imagine my disappointment when I went up to the bar and not one but two bar tenders looked at me and kept walking past...three or four times. Finally, I just asked the bar back how I could get your tickets which was why my mom and I stopped by. He let me know the bartender would be able to help me out. Standing at the bar for a bit longer, the bartender finally stopped by to sell us two tickets. 

We went on the tour which was informative and the story behind the founding and naming of Coppertail was great. The tour is a great deal. You get a pint glass (not sold in the shop), a free beer and tastings along the tour for $7.50. 

I decided to get Sometimes You Don't, a porter with coconut, vanilla and cocoa nibs. It was incredibly smooth and the coconut came through. 

The unfortunate service at the beginning knocked off a star but I still enjoyed the tour and the tap room. It's still one of my favorite Florida breweries but their welcome and customer service needs some work."
Food,3.5,OR,"Crossing Vineyards and Winery gave us an EXCEPTIONAL experience. The owner and staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and create a special day. We merely booked the private lunch with a wine tasting, but we left feeling like we booked a private event with so many perks. We felt the warmth and comfort from the staff immediately and you could tell the guests around us did as well. We were free to roam around, take pictures in the most beautiful areas around the property, and enjoy the scenery. The wine tasting was entraining and informative, with several wines added to our favorite list. I look forward to coming back as a date with my husband, or a private event. For anyone planning a wedding, this place is a MUST to checkout. There were so many aspects that were special and picturesque, I could imagine how beautiful a wedding day would be. The stone entryway, the iron gates, the fountain and garden patio, the wine cellar,barrel rooms, the outdoor tent and bar area, and of course the acres of lush greenery. Thank you for having us and a special shout-out to TOM!"

All right, this place is a chain. I will admit that I have been disappointed.

I had the donut ice cream and the donut holes. I was expecting it to be fresh and not stale.  The donut holes were soft and the donuts were cold.  I was disappointed to see them make the donuts on site.  I also didn't want them to be stale.  I'm not sure what happened with the donut holes, but I wanted to try something different.  I really wanted to try it, but I didn't get what I wanted.  I ended up going with a blueberry glazed.  It was good, but not worth the $6.50 for a dozen donuts.

Food,4.5,CG,"Ok, so this was the first time I ever had a gelato from this place. I ordered the Strawberry gelato (a banana, strawberry and peach) and the Butter Pecan (a vanilla bean). It was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend got the Butter Pecan and it was pretty good. I did get the Oreo and it was a little sweet. I liked the frosting better. I think it was just too sweet for me. I think I would have liked more of it. The Butter Pecan was a little too sweet for my liking. My husband got the Butter Pecan and he enjoyed it. They do have a small food menu but I didn't think to try it. I can't wait to go back and try the other flavors. Also, the service was pretty good. I would definitely go back.

Food,4.0,OR,"It turns out World Market has a wine tasting about once a month.  Somehow I swear I've made every single one for the past 6 months.  Luck?  Probably not, I just love to come here so much that I'm here almost every Saturday, and some of those happen to be wine tasting time.

Why should you go... well, they have some pretty cool fruniture, and really fantastic seasonal stuff.  For example, it is summer right now and they have some of the cutest unbrellas, tables, and outside table ware/accessories.  I recently bought some clear plastic wine glasses that look pretty classy but won't break if I accidentally drop them on the pool deck.  Also, if there is some popular foreign food item that you love, but you can't find (curry ketchup, veggiemite, york gold tea, asian candies... etc.) they always seem to have what you're looking for.  These items also make great gifts.

In addition, I also find the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  Even if I don't buy anything a trip here seems refreshing, but how often do I go in and buy NOTHING.... ummm, almost never."
Food,3.0,OR,"So, we stopped by this place one day thinking this was a permanent farmer's market or something.  But, once we walked in, we realized it was an Indian grocery store.
We couldn't be more thrilled cause we just recently moved to a nearby apt complex.

I agree with EllenM, they have very inexpensive produce and a good variety as well.  But, because of how new this place is and low foot traffic, some of the specialty produce isn't all that fresh.  Oh, they don't always put out all their produce or the freshest stuff.  If you want something that you don't find or would like more fresh stuff, they will get them from their cooler/freezer. So, just ask.

The owners/staff are definitely very friendly.

For an indian grocery store, this by far have the cheapest prices for reputable brand items in the norristown area.  And, they are slowly growing and bringing in more items and variety.  So, even though they may not have a great variety of items yet, you can get all your basics.

As mentioned earlier, definitely don't forget to check out their jams and dried fruits section.  You won't regret it."
Food,4.0,OR,"Honestly, I was prepared to hate this Sno-ball.  I had a cheesecake stuffed snoball (the unique draw of this Sno-la) before and was not thrilled with the combination.  I went back today, ordered a regular snoball with condensed milk and I have to say, this place ranks right up there with the best of New Orleans Sno-ball makers.

I took a change with the Key Lime Cream flavor which looked unnaturally florescent with condensed milk.  Without the distraction of a too cold, gooey cheesecake center, this is just a dang good snoball.  Super soft, fine ice and the exact flavor I was hoping for.  I was skeptical with the amount of lime green syrup added but despite my assumptions, the syrup was not too sweet.  I guess they know what they're doing.

Upsides to Sno-la, great location (for me), a really large and unique variety of flavors, plus toppings and fillings you don't see elsewhere like cheesecake, whipped cream, fresh fruit, cookies, etc.  I feel confident enough in their quality now that I might even give cheesecake another try.  The Berry Chantilly looks really appealing!  Two thumbs up Sno-la!"

Food,3.0,OR,"DON'T GET GAS FROM HERE IT'S BAD!!!

Getting gas from this place was the worst experience. We were on a road trip on our way home with our three dogs and stopped to fill up (premium) at Speedway on Valencia and I-10. After filling up and getting back on the road, two miles on I-10 our car stopped. It just wouldn't go anymore. This is a dangerous two lane highway! After the ordeal (hours) of finally getting a tow truck and car towed to the dealership, we found a pet friendly hotel and were able to get to the airport and rent a car (we still had to get to Phoenix). It turns out it was bad gas, our repair bill came out to $1400, we spent $100 on a hotel, $300 on a car rental and had to get our car repaired in Tucson. Not to mention the nightmare experience we had due to Speedway's inferior quality of gas. 

My husband called the station to find out about getting reimbursed and they said, yes, it was bad gas that other people were calling in also; then gave him another number to call. 

This place deserves negative stars!"
Food,4.5,OR,"The place to get fresh vegetables in Center City. Period. Unless you actually live next to the Italian Market this is the best and most convenient place to get your produce. They take credit, have great selection and good stuff, and are really cheap!

People have voted both ""Yes"" and ""No"" on wheelchair accessibility, so I think I should elaborate. There are no stairs or ledges that would prevent a person in a wheelchair from coming into the store. Most of the aisles are also reasonably wide, and a person in a wheelchair probably wouldn't have too much trouble reaching most of the stuff. So it's pretty accessible. until you put other people in it. Iovine's is almost literally packed on weekends, and it's hard to walk through the aisles with a small basket, let alone navigate them in a wheelchair. They're just too popular for their own good, and they're not big enough to handle the Saturday crowds. Those in wheelchairs (or scooters or even walkers) are best off hitting it during off-peak hours, like weekday mornings. Overall an awesome place to get fresh fruit and veggies."
Food,4.0,OR,"No one likes making groceries (yes, that's what we call in Louisiana), but when you've got to do it, you might as well enjoy it.  And enjoy it you will, at this location of the Fresh Market.  

I've been in hundreds of food stores around the country and this one compares favorably with the best of the best.  First, the space they occupy couldn't be any cooler.  It's like shopping in your favorite bookstore, but with an unbelievable selection of gourmet foods and beverages.  As you'd expect, the perimeter departments are the stars of the show, particularly produce, floral, meat, seafood and deli.  The bakery and cheese departments are pretty good, but not world-class.  The second floor wine and beer market is very cool.  Awesome seating area up there too, but I don't see the store leadership taking full advantage of the space (wine tastings, cooking classes, etc.).  

The checkouts are usually friendly and efficient, but you don't tend to get much service anywhere else in the store, unless you specifically ask for it.

The overall shopping experience is with the trip up St Charles via driving or streetcar."

Food,4.5,OR,"Let me just explain that for those who don't really get Trader Joe's, well, its just awesome. They have all of your basic foods, most of them in healthier form. Think organic, farm-raised, natural, etc. However, a recent study by the popular blogger, The Food Babe, had said that some of TJ's products have some chemicals in them. But you'll find a great selection on plenty of foods. Even better, a lot of it is reasonably priced. I'll give you a fine example: their peanut butter, which can save you $3 then buying the organic p.b. from Target across the parking lot. 

The staff is friendly, and they always look like they're having fun. Coincidentally, I recently read that Trader Joe's is one of the Top 100 Best Places to Work, according to some big-named publication. Its always busy at this location, plus the parking lot can be quite a hassle. I've started taking the Metrolink to the Commons, so that can erase a bit of a headache for those who drive there. My only other complaint: this is the closest location for me (I live in Glen Carbon, IL!), even though there's an Aldi in my town."
Food,4.5,OR,"My friends and I did not enjoy the doughnuts here. I am a doughnut fanatic, so I was really pumped to visit a new indie shop. When we walked in, it smelled really good, which is always the first thing I take note of to determine if a bake shop is legit.

Unfortunately, the doughnuts did not impress. It's a bad sign when you don't finish a doughnut, and a couple of them went unfinished. They all look great, but there's something off about the dough itself. And they left too much of a greasy print in the box. The peanut-topped one we got tasted a little stale. The worst part was biting into something you think is gonna be fluffy and delicious, but it just gives way and sort of sinks into nothing. That was unfortunately our experience with the yeast doughnuts.

The shop itself seemed a little rundown. The tables were not very clean. It sort of looked like a 24/7 diner. We asked for waters, and my friend was brought a dirty glass. 

I like to try out indie places, so the chains don't eat up all the business. But we'll not be heading back to Fray's."

The kids played mini-golf, had pizza/cake, and did batting cages and had an awesome time.  I think the adults had as much fun as the kids in the batting cages.  Luckily we had enough parents who helped escort the kids around the golf course and keep score (something I hadn't really thought of prior!).  We did it at 11am so it was not crowded.  The pizzas provided were small (they order from Pizza Hut) so I would order extra to make sure you have enough.

That being said the people in the deli are saints. They have to put up with so much but still try so hard to stay upbeat. The wait is long for the deli... actually all lines are super long.

I haven't been to an Aldi that I didn't like, but this location is certainly the best.

I freaking love Aldi. I only go occasionally, but when I do, I always leave so excited at the savings. You can't get everything there, but you can get much more than you'd expect at prices that will make you feel like kind of a chump for paying what you pay at the other grocery stores.

Some of my favorite steals include blue cheese crumbles for like $1.99 and bagged premium lettuce for the same. I love the roasted almonds, salad dressing and all condiments. I've tried boneless chicken breasts and 90% lean hamburger on several occasions and the meat's good quality and about $3.00 less than other stores a pack. Produce is a steal - I love getting berries during summer for like .99 cents.

Food,4.5,OR,"Alright look, I like ice cream. I actually love ice cream. These kind of ice cream shops, using fresh ingredients and creating inventive flavors (hellloooo green tomato!) are my absolute dream. I'm sorry Creole Creamery in New Orleans, but there's a new king (or is it queen) in town!

The folks at Jeni's are so nice and willing to let you sample as much as you'd like. I hate the places that limit you and look at you like you should know what you want as soon as you read the name. Seriously, come one, if that's the case limit the menu!  I opted for two half scoops (a small) of roasted strawberry and the Brown Butter & Almond Brittle. Both were out of this world, but the strawberry might have been the best strawberry I've ever had. Everything we tried was simply amazing and its a very hard thing to choose, but the bottom line is you have to choose to go. If you aren't planning on going to East Nashville, change your plans, its a must. Best part of experiencing Jeni's. I find out they distribute pints to NC."
Food,3.0,OR,"I've been waiting months for this store to open up and boy, has it been worth the wait! The store is organized in a logical manner and it is very easy to navigate once you have the lay of the land. What I especially like is the natural foods section - very generous space is given to organic foods and health and beauty aids. The produce is high quality and reasonably priced. The meat section is huge and offers a great selection. I have not had a chance to sample the salad bars yet, though it's great to have Starbucks in the store! The cashiers are friendly and polite and employees on the floor seem willing to assist. I believe that there was definitely a need for a new supermarket in the 19083 zip code and this store does not disappoint.

The beer garden is great - there is a huge selection of regional and microbreweries. 

A nice bonus is the Giant Gas Station, where you can redeem points on your bonus card for a discount on gasoline. 

I look forward to many years of shopping at this Giant location - it's the biggest and the best Giant in this region."
Food,4.0,OR,"Real talk: I always thought that Hobbs was a great idea, but that it was a notion that could benefit from some improvement. I got to sorta vicariously witness its growth through friends who've worked here, but I think they've finally found their niche. Service is great, whoever was working the floor this morning seemed to have a strong relationship with some regulars who walked in (as well as strangers like myself). It's not as cheap as the neighboring Dunkin Donuts, but they're not outrageously expensive either and I'm sure whatever readers this review might have know a thing or two about supporting local business. My muffin and coffee were standard and good. What really prompted me to write this was that they gave me a free Fentimans! (P.s. Swarthmore: Fentimans is a delicious line of colas that is less abundant in the burbs, please recognize a good thing when it is bestowed upon you and drink these so that they don't sit there! If this seems alarming or you're feenin for your typical cola I would suggest buying the curiosity cola and using it to construct a bumpin root beer float). Short story even shorter: give Hobbs a chance."

I love the fact that it is a little bit more traditional for my taste, but I love the fact that they have some cool unique drinks and coffee drinks that are made in house. The coffee is great too. I'm not a huge coffee drinker but this place makes it a point to try different things from the menu.

Food,3.0,OR,"For the last year, I've sometimes gone here because it's closer to my work than Starbucks, but it's worth my time to avoid this and go to Starbucks from now on. The service and product here has steadily declined. The last three times I came I averaged a 15 minute wait for an iced coffee and pastry. Whether I go in or drive thru makes no difference. The staff is nice enough, but I blame management. To have only 2 baristas during the busy early morning shift is beyond me. The set up for the baristas to serve is inefficient, for example, when the person has to walk away to the drive thru window get sweetener because it doesn't seem to be kept in the prep area. The place looks run down and there is old dirt lining the floor around the edges of the food case, counters etc.  Last week the doughnuts were stale. I also have an issue with the prices. Their large iced coffee is no cheaper than Starbucks, but is smaller than a large at SB. I want to support local businesses, but unfortunately I think this PJs will be a last resort from now on."
Food,3.5,OR,"Until now, I had only had Ben & Jerry's from the freezer section of the grocery store even though I used to work in the area where this Ben & Jerry's is located. The problem with the location is parking, as is the problem with most of the restaurants in the area. Good luck finding a free parking spot!

My most favorite thing with Ben & Jerry's in the freezer section of the grocery store is reading the names and descriptions of the flavors. While the store offers all the awesomely named flavors, only a few include the description of the ingredients on the sign. I'm sure if I had asked the nice guy behind the counter what all was in each, he would have gladly answered, but it took the fun out of it for me not to be able to read them myself. Besides, who wants to be the one to bug the guy behind the counter with a bunch of different questions?  

The service was very friendly, and the atmopshere is nice. Points lost for location and lack of descriptions. I think I'll stick with the freezer section next time unless I am already parked in the area."

Food,4.0,OR,"My daughter had beignets from Cafe du Monde as a must-do item while in NOLA. We had stopped by Jackson Square around 9:30 a.m. on a Friday. The (I think) original Cafe du Monde location then had a waiting line about 100 yards long (for a table?) along the sidewalk, in the sun.  We skipped that. 

Later in the day as an alternate, we walked from our hotel down Poydras Street to the River and, venturing through the hotel there, arrived at the Riverwalk mall.  After further hiking, we eventually found their food court, which features a satellite location of Cafe du Monde.  

There was only one party ahead of us in the line here, plus it was indoors and air-conditioned!  My daughter got an order of 3 beignets and we looked for a table but their limited dine-in area was full (of large parties). We found a table in a nearby common area. She had one of the beignets and I tried a bit of a 2nd. Her verdict was that they over-used the powdered sugar and that she'd had a superior beignet in a breakfast place back home. These weren't bad, but were perhaps just over-hyped."
Food,3.5,OR,"This store is great!  I would say to the ladies who have issued complaints about thier toddlers being tired - PLEASE do not bring your tired toddlers to the store.  It is the patrons who can ruin a shopping experience much faster than an employee.
I just moved to Boise and had never heard of WinCo Foods.  This store is great for a number of reasons: 1) their prices are great 2) you can ask any employee in the store where an item is and they not only can tell you but will walk you to it if you want them to 3)  One reason they can keep prices so low is that they don't take credit cards and they don't hire people to bag your groceries.  4) A lot of their produce is locally grown and very fresh.  When it begins to get over ripe - it is discounted to the bone so I don't mind picking out a few over ripe strawberries for $99/lb. 5) Employees and Checkers have a smile and a good attitude.

The only thing that would make this store better would be if people would leave their children home when grocery shopping."
Food,4.5,OR,"This was close to the Science Center.  There espresso-based drinks were very good and they would top it off with foam art :)  They use a special system to make each unique cup of coffee.  I can't remember what it is, but the device is fairly small and they push the coffee through using their muscles.  

They have a good selection of loose teas to choose from.  My husband has issues with coffee so has been forced to become a tea drinker and is super picky about his teas, since he wants them to be similar to coffee in taste and fullness.  He found one that met that criteria there and loved it so much, he contacted the maker of the tea and ordered some for home.  

They also had 2-3 gluten-free pastry options which is extremely rare for coffee shops.  I had one and it was really good (even more rare at a coffee shop).

The staff was super friendly.  It was a great experience all-around so we ended up going there 2 days in a row.  The next time we are in town, we will be sure to go there again."

After cruising into this massive hangar of a building that probably has it's own zip code and has at least one and possibly two starbucks,

I ended riding my bike around the store for about 30min, popped a few wheelies, ate some ice cream, picked up some toys and rode my bike right out the store. Nobody even blinked an eye. All in all it was a surreal experience that I don't need to replicate.

Originally, we tried to contact the one in the Olde Sproul Shopping plaza but no one picked up the phone.  This one was my next choice and the guy said he was still open until 9.  

When we get there, the place is all dark.  I think there is was a neon sign that said open.  Since they had 9 blueberry? minis instead of 10 around 6 pm on 1/2/21, this place gave 3 extra minis of a different flavor.  My relatives got the impression that they were running out of food.  So the person in the store decided to make the store dark so that less people would be coming in.  

I thought that maybe they were having problems with their power.

The idea that I called this place beforehand and they didn't tell me about any power outage or such gave me that typical American stereotypical vibe that there might be someone of foreign origin at this particular store who may be great at running a store or business but that there can be some kinks in fluent communication and expression."

Culpepper's for dinner, then Ted Drewes for dessert - I'm a happy man. I've never seen them without lines 6 deep, and that's with 6 or 8 windows operating! Still, they move quickly and prices are amazingly good, so it's definitely worth it. Ted Drewes has been a local fixture for so long that you'll see 3 generations of people hanging around eating and chatting - there's no seating, so it's either standing or sitting on the hood/trunk of your car. (With that many people milling around parking can be challenging.)

The frozen custard itself is amazing. Delicious and as smooth and rich as the highest-quality ice cream you've ever had. A large range of excellent toppings and mix-ins are available. I thought my tart cherry and hot fudge (""Cardinal Sin"") was good until I tried my dad's raspberry; if he hadn't turned his back on me and walked away (!) after my one bite, he might not have gotten any more.

I decided to order it in a misto shake with vanilla ice cream. It was made very fast and came out nice and cool! 
It was very sweet, but the vanilla ice cream somewhat balanced it out. It was a nice tasty treat though it was filling. 

The staff here was very nice and made all of the items very quickly, but of quality. The lady was also very nice. 

Unfortunately, they did not sell soft-pretzels at this location and did not have any seating. Most other Rita's, at least have a few benches. Still, there is a playground and some benches across the street.

Urban farmer's markets have changed drastically in the past 5 years.   They've gone from being strictly places to buy fresh produce/eggs/meat to a 50/50 split of that stuff and food/drink vendors.   And I applaud the change.    Today's farmer's markets are events for the whole family.   Carmel's is no slouch in this respect.   There were at least 10 food/drink vendors there so everyone in your family will surely be able to find something for breakfast/brunch/lunch.   The way the vendors are lined up (in a big rectangle) around the green is conducive to having a little picnic on the grass and listening to the live music from the local band playing on one end of the green.

The market is located steps from the Monon trail so you can ride your bike and not worry about parking (the market sets up a temporary bike corral area for the market)."

However, I have 2 real complaints.

1.  At first It hought they seemed to care about our health and safety.  Even though masks are no longer required in Philadelphia, you have to wear a mask to place an order.  While they seem to care about COVID, they don't care about our general health.  The person who handed over the ice cream was filthy.  His shirt was covered in who knows what and his pants were ripped and shredded (not as though it was done for style).  Let's just say I know if he wears boxers or briefs -- I saw more of his undergarments than his jeans when he turned around because the jeans were shreaded on his backside.  Yuck!

2.  When he handed me the ice cream, he gave no napkins.  I asked him for some napkins, so he handed over 1 napkin for each order of ice cream.  When I mentioned that I needed extra because I had kids, he handed over 1 more napkin.  You would think with their prices, they could afford the napkins."
Food,4.0,OR,"When I really want a treat, I always know that Tanya will have a wonderful peanutbutter concoction available for me.  Whether it's the traditional peanutbutter chocolate milkshake, a peanutbutter banana smoothie, or just plain peanutbutter frozen yogurt; I can always get my PB fix here in the ""creamiest"" way.  I know I'm a bit of a nut for peanutbutter; but if there is anyone else out there like me, they'll love this place.  

And yes, for the more ""normal"" tastes - they always have a wonderful array of sweet and fruity flavors from which to choose.  If I was in a fruity mood, I would likely choose the Hawaiian Smoothie made with pineapple and mango.

As for my kids... they usually try all the flavors and then get a chocolate vanilla twist.  But, they keep it exciting by choosing lots of fun toppings.  You can make your own sundaes here.  But watch out... when you get to the register, you pay by the ounce and those tantalizingly artistic treats, piled high, will cost you plenty. Excellent marketing... no small cups available.

Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked to seafood perfection. The prices for the platters we tried were $20.00-32.00 if I'm not mistaken. It's take out only but they can't seem to answer their phones to order ahead so you're stuck sitting in the middle of Camden waiting for your food and the cops are more than happy to question you instantly as to why you're there which gets old but it can't be avoided.  It's also kinda nasty looking inside but it just needs some TLC.  --  The only reason(s) I'm giving it four stars is due to the location, they NEVER answer their phone and the guy ripped me off on the price of shrimp, kinda treated me poorly and made it very clear I didn't really belong there.

Food,4.0,OR,"So far, this is the largest korean market I've been to in Tampa area. They do roll Kimbap (korean all cooked sushi rolls) every day BUT you need to get to the store early or they run out! Don't freal out because you see the sushi roll on the counter. This type DOES NOT need to be refrigerated for a little while. Completely safe & I've never gotten sick. Sticking it in the fridge will ruin the rice anyway. They have a decent selection of side dishes. I have only tried their small container of kimchi & for my personal taste, I thought it was too bland because I like mine very spicy. I do make my own though but I like when I can find a place in town that happens to make it to my taste. I love getting the asian body scubber but they only have the same brand everyone else in town does that hurts my skin because its too darn rough. I'm looking for a soft one like I found in CA. As for people complaining about expired things, I am always in the habit of checking every date even at Publix. So, it's human error & can happen anywhere."
Food,3.5,OR,"This is probably the safest, cleanest and best stocked Winn Dixie in the city.  Because it is in River Ridge, it has a very nice clientele and good staff.  

They have a large selection of prepared food (the fam likes the rotisserie chickens), bakery, deli and seafood.

I find their produce section a little above average.  Luckily there is a Breaux Mart down the road in River Ridge so between the two stores you can generally find whatever you're looking for.

I like this Winn Dixie's selection of meats and they always have head-on large boiled shrimp for ~$3-$5 a package that I pick up every time I'm there.

As with all Winn-Dixie's, you need to have their Rewards Card in order to get the best prices and the gas savings deal is incredible.

I am always shocked at the amount of specialty items they carry at this store.  In the past few months, fresh clams were just about the only item I haven't been able to find.

Before Katrina this location was open 24 hours which was awesome.  I don't think there are any 24 hour grocery stores around any longer (not even Wal-Mart). That would bump this 4 star store up to a 5!"

Food,1.5,OR,"10 PM & later- DON'T GO
10 PM & earlier- Try not to go

10 PM self checkout closes meaning EVERYONE has to go through the few lines that are open... this Walmart is the closest to BAD AREAS.
A single person in line could need to split purchases between cards, vouchers & cash with multiple people splitting more ways.  Plus- cashiers are dealing with a lot of merchandise being returned at time of purchase (not enough money... purchase not approved on EBT or vouchers or whatever).  All of this takes time on an already extremely long line.   People can't play this stuff as much @ self checkout.

This is just a far more dirty & disorganized Walmart.
Customers shove back merchandise on shelfs anywhere & end up hiding items.  3 Bean Salad in a can took me 20 minutes & an employee 10 minutes to find hidden behind items not for that isle.  Consistently like this.  Employees are usually helpful, but they're usually as dumbfounded as me.

However, I do find item stacked in wrong bins & areas by store employees also.  I get excited by the price & then read that the sign is describing a different item.

The person speaking was a pharmacist who had, presumably, just clocked out. The counter guy, who is super nice asks her, ""Why didn't he fill it before he left?"" She repeats herself word for word. ""The pharmacist went to lunch for an hour. He won't be back for at least 20 minutes. Nothing we can do."" Shrug. Who cares?Next!

This is the first time I have ever sampled gelato, and I became an instant fan the moment the first tiny spoonful hit my taste buds.  I cannot wait to go back and try a new flavor and/or flavor combo.  I went with Tiramisu and chocolate, and it was simply delicious.  

The ambiance is nice and cozy - very similar to a coffee shop, and it was not crowded by any means.  The staff were very cordial and allowed us to sample a few different flavors before deciding.  They also gave us recommendations as far as flavor combos go, which certainly helped me decide.  

Overall, it was a wonderful dessert experience.  It is definitely a nice place to go for a quick bite to eat.

the cake was so amazing that all our guests were raving about it after an incredibly stuffing meal. it was firm, dense, as a wedding cake should be (imo), but somehow didn't feel very heavy. the chocolate cake is dark and intense, and the raspberry meringue buttercream is the perfect balance of tart and buttery. i wanted to follow the tradition and freeze part of that top tier for the first anniversary because it was so good. but that was totally not happening as our guests devoured all of it. decided we just have to go back and order that same tier again for our anniversary. it was so good I can't stop thinking about it almost a year after the wedding. can't wait for the anniversary cake!"

Food,2.0,OR,"A Starbucks like any other Starbucks. This is the one I visit when I work in the mall, and there isn't anything special about it, but there's nothing I have found particularly awful, either. I mostly visit here as oppossed to Tim Hortons or Seond Cup because of the My Starbucks Rewards program.

The lineups can get pretty ridiculous, obviously, since it's in a mall. They also tend to have only one person on till, even when it does get crazy, which is a bit annoying, especially if you're going there on your break and don't exactly have 15 minutes to spend standing in line to order and again waiting for that order. But most of the servers I've had have been very friendly and good at their jobs. There are one or two there that I dread getting, but that's the same anywhere.

My coffee usually tastes just as I expect it to, and only once or twice have they gotten anything on my order wrong (and they are always happy to fix it). A good option if you're in the mall and want a drink or snack. (Though don't hold out hope of them having the new-ish bistro boxes in stock - they're sold out more often than not!)"

Food,2.0,OR,"Convenient location to where I live and businesses I travel to, this gas station has been one of my ""go-tos"" since moving to Tampa. The layout of the outdoor part of the station itself is nice, pretty spacious and easily accessible. I have experienced that the station has undergone some ownership/management changes since I've come here and even closed down briefly but it's back in action! It's basically what you'd find at a gas station with staple items in the shop but the gas prices I find are usually on the lower end of the price spectrum. The staff I've encountered are friendly and helpful.

There is a car wash which does a good basic job. It's the type where you elect to get it from the pump when prompted with a question if you're interested in one-if you select ""yes"" then you're furnished with a code to use at the entrance of the car wash. It by no means delivers a car wash of a professional level but it will get those bugs of your car and stains off your windshield.

Obviously there was a lot of money put into this facility and course, it all looks great and is now the home to the University of Arizona Men's & Women's golf programs (Bear Down!!), which is impressive. 

The actually course design itself is nothing to write home about...every hole feels somewhat similar, mostly straight forward holes with no doglegs, forced carries, elevation changes that make a golf course dynamic. The course condition however was immaculate and I was very impressed.

The real reason this place gets 3 stars is the Troon Golf Management. We received a cold welcome and were treated as if we had never played golf before, which is standard at most Troon Golf courses. There is a sign at the entrance requiring you to use the bag drop, which is just a ploy for additional tips given the parking lot is literally 20 feet from the bag drop. Lastly, when we finished our round we were harassed by the staff to allow them to clean our clubs. When I told the staffer I was fine, he decided to make a snide comment about there being a blade of grass on my clubs. Hilarious.

Florissant has its surprises.  When hanging in the county, one might not have high hopes for good places for meals and treats.  However, my old neck of the woods has some pretty good stops, and Doozles Frozen Cusard is one of them.

I won't lie.  Doozles comes secondary to Fritz's.  It's always been the natural order of things.  Not that Doozles doesn't do its thing well, but I've always preferred Fritz's over Doozles.  It's an age-old Florissant conversation!

One thing that separates Doozles from Fritz's is the variety.  You're pretty well limited to frozen custard at its friendly rival.  Doozles has custard and ice cream in both scoops and soft serve.  The assortment of treats is endless!

One of my favorite things to get there is the bubble gum ice cream.  Yes, I am 32 and still eating bubble gum flavored ice cream.  I love it!  However, the hard ice creams range from regular vanilla all the way to moose tracks and orange sherbet.

Food,2.5,OR,"This is one of my favorite Targets in the area. It's probably second behind the Smyrna location, but that's a Super Target, so it's not a fair fight. This Target feels a little larger than your average store. This store also seems to have more checkout people on the registers than other stores, at least recently. 

They've got a Starbucks if you're into that. The produce & meat section always seems fresh. I'm a little disappointed in their clearance located on the end caps. You never really find that good of a deal. Lots of 15% or 30% off but you never really see any 50% or the elusive 70% off. But I still like to hunt. 

One of my big pet peeves of this store is the parking lot. It's a pain in the ass to get in & I feel like they've got too many stores in the strip mall for the size of the lot. It's always an experience trying to get in, park, then get back out into Old Hickory Blvd. You can enter and exit the lot at the Brentwood Commons Way and Old Hickory intersection, and come in kind of the back side of Target, I find that to be a lot faster and less frustrating."

I had a maple glaze and a chocolate croissant. Both were fantastic. I'm not a fan of croissants, but this was the perfect balance of sweetness and sweetness. My husband had a bacon and cheese croissant, which was very good, as well as a cinnamon raisin.

Food,4.5,OR,"I've been going here since the Japanese Festival in 2008. Occasionally I come back mostly for the festival but I've also visited for the Chinese Festival and only yesterday, with a friend from out of town.

The gardens seem to get better and better with each visit. You would think you've seen it all but they add more exhibits and plants or maybe because it's so large I missed out on certain nooks previously. 

There are two cafes to eat at during your stay (and believe me, after all that walking you will work up an appetite). One in the main building on the top floor and one just outside a few blocks down. I haven't been able to go to either since they're always so busy. We tried to eat on premises but there was a 50 minute wait time and we were too hungry for that. Another time.

I would recommend visiting April-May because that's when the weather is nice and plants are coming into bloom. It's hard to visit and completely enjoy the gardens in the summer with the heat. I've never visited during the winter yet but I would like to.

Food,3.5,OR,"Starbucks, you failed me. 

When I usually stop here on Saturdays, the parking lot is full, people are parking next door at Lion's Choice, and the drive-thru is snaked out to the street. Yet I still get in and out quickly, with a correct order.

Today, Memorial Day, the lot was half empty, no cars next door at Lion's Choice, and only 2 cars in front of me in the drive-thru.

I ordered my usual venti caramel macchiato and pulled around. I could see right away that there was a problem with the first car's order and they were remaking it. The car in front of me went without incident, but I waited a full ten minutes after paying to be served. They made the order for the car  behind me, then the one for the car behind that. The server verified that I had a venti caramel macch, and still I waited for them to make it. When it finally came I put it into the cupholder, tipped, and left. 

Um, yeah, Starbucks, do you REALLY think I can't tell the difference between a caramel macch and a vanilla soy latte? Yep, after all that they still got my order wrong.

They have a great produce section and it's always clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. I usually go to the meat and seafood section for the produce. The produce is great and the seafood is fresh. I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I love their meat department. I love their produce.

So. we ended up at the busiest ice cream parlor in town. The line was only 40 minutes long but felt longer because my lack of fire for the cold stuff. I played it smart though and vultured off everyone else's orders. My wife ordered hydrox cookie with rocky road. Scoops are big, but they rightfully should be for the cost of a cupful of creamy cow. Good flavors of cookies and cream with the rocky road chocolate. My mother got the green tea ice cream straight up, homie. It was indeed true to the flavor with seemingly no artificial sweetening and natural tea flavor from the cup #truth. Finally I vultured the butter pecan scoop on a waffle cone that my mother in law ordered. Great chunks of pecan with a swirling blast of butter and. oh what do I know about ice cream???!! It was good. Overall good ice cream. For me it is not worth the wait unless I am trying to please a visitor.

Food,4.5,OR,"THIS PLACE!! Let me start this off by saying, I can tend to be kind of a baked good snob, which probably isn't a good thing because that gives away just how often I eat baked goods.. way more than my body probably cares for, but I just can't help myself!

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, this place checks all the boxes! Be aware, this review is specifically for the quality of their baked goods, and the service.. it was a small place so the atmosphere was nothing crazy, and during COVID times there wasn't even any seating.. but it's all good, because these baked goods were to die for!

They specialized in croissant type of baked goods, which can be REALLY GOOD if prepared right (rare) or REALLY BAD if prepared wrong (common). This place was one of the rare ones, the croissants were super flaky and crunchy on the outside, but once you bit into them it was all soft and doughy goodness, thinking about them makes me want to fly back down to Reno right now (checking tickets). 

Not only were the baked goods delicious, but the service was very friendly and helpful. This is definitely on a short list of my favorite bakeries, can't wait to be back!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Top notch meadery in the center of the newly ascendant Tampa Heights area. I was honestly never much of a mead fan but had to try this out based on the national level attention that Garagiste has had since their opening was announced. 

First off there is parking directly off Florida Ave to the south of the building (otherwise there is street parking and 2 outdoor lots one block over to the west. 

The mead: They offer both 3 and 6 oz pours (quite ample given the high abv and sweetness). Their PB&J variants were simply awesome. Three were on tap and I tried the strawberry PB&J and grape PB&J. The nose of strong, natural, fresh peanuts hit me as soon as they placed the glass in front of me. I felt suddenly like a kid biting into a grape PB&J sandwich upon the first sip. I will focus on trying all PB&J's in future visits. However I did try the blueberry vanilla - great fresh taste and quality. Certainly worth it but their PB&J is not to be missed. 

Keep in mind there is food nearby at Ulele and The Hall and Hidden Springs brewery is 2 buildings down. Yes, I'm just trying to point out how up and coming this area is."

Food,5.0,OR,"Why 5 stars? Because this ice cream is as good as it gets in Tampa Bay.

   ---   ---   ---

After dinner nearby, my wife and I were craving something sweet because that's what happens approximately 100.00% of the time. I had already been thinking ahead and did a little research before we started eating to see if there were maybe any new dessert spots in Ybor. Indeed there was and it happened to be Chill Bros, sporting a 5-star overall average.

As I do when I walk into an ice cream shop, I really wanted to sample virtually every flavor they had, but I narrowed down my choices to just a few. I really liked each flavor that I sampled, but I couldn't resist the guava pastel or the double down oreo.

Both of these were pretty much as perfect as ice cream gets. I couldn't imagine enjoying dessert much more than this. 

My wife ended up doing a chocolate chip sake, but sadly, she had the opposite experience. Her shake was very watery and we both assumed it was user-error on the part of the person making it. I felt bad for the wife, but despite that hiccup, I was in heaven and couldn't give Chill Bros anything other than 5-stars."
Food,2.5,OR,"Aetna/CVS has some serious issues filling prescriptions due staff cuts and overworking their staff.  In my opinion, the possibility of prescriptions being mis-filled is a real risk!  After having issues of having my wife's prescriptions at the CVS at 8809 New Tampa Blvd (see related review with additional details), I was sent to this store near the Wire Grass Mall.  Once there, I was told that it would take them 3 days to fill my wife's prescriptions.  After telling them my wife's doctor prescribed the prescriptions to be started today, one for diabetes testing, and another for prednisone for an allergic reaction, the store acquiesed and agreed to filled the prescription, but it would take an hour.  While waiting for the prescriptions to be filled, I found out the reason the store was 3 days behind in filling prescriptions was that Aetna/CVS had cut their staff by 50%, and people were working extended hours to try to catch up.  Historically, CVS has had issue with mis-filled prescriptions.  It seems to me that the risk of this reoccurring is increased as a result of the staff cuts at this store and various others in the area.  Consequently, I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GO TO CVS TO FILL PRESCRIPTIONS!"

Food,4.5,OR,"The kid behind the counter didn't act friendly the first time I was there.  He gave me kind of a sullen glare when I returned the following week for the next book in the series I was reading.  I have blonde hair - maybe that offended him.  Or maybe he was resentful about having to work in a bookstore instead of, say, a salt mine.  I read fantasy...and my partner and I dared to ask him if he'd seen a certain book.  That seemed to offend him mightily.

The inside of this place might offend me, too, if I worked there.  It's kind of not much more than a bunch of shelves with aging books crammed on and stacked around the edges in no real sense of order.  It's dim and a little bit on the dirty side.  No wonder our cardigan-wearing friend up front seemed so depressed and angry.

I love bookstores, and I always, always, always give them the benefit of the doubt.  But I've found far better ones here in Tampa, staffed by people who seem far happier to be selling me my nerdy fantasy books.

F.y.i their blueberry loaf warmed up in the morning with just a tad of butter is pure heaven!

The drinks are pretty good as well. I had their vanilla chai and I feel like it would definitely give Starbucks a run for it's money. I have also indulged in their banana split hot chocolate which is great for dipping cookies in....if you can't tell by now im pretty in love with this place.

The staff at this location seemed very nice. I was helped by two different people and they both had big smiles on their face. I wonder if it has something to do with being around cookies all day? Don't just take my word for it though...go try it for yourself and be prepared to fall in love with cookies all over again."
Food,4.5,OR,"This place is SO MUCH FUN! They have so many options for teas and coffee, I always read their whole menu and think about what I should get then end up getting the same thing (honey milk tea, non dairy creamer, 50% sweet).

I don't like boba balls in general so I get it without those but if you like them, they have the best ones here. The vibe is always so fun! They have wifi (the password is teatime101) so you can bring your laptop and get some work done. They also have a lot of games you can play, I love Uno, connect 4, Jenga, and Cards Against Humanity. 

They have a loyalty card you can get so you stamp for each one you buy and eventually get a free drink. They're also open late (until 11pm) so it's a great place to hang out or study with a friend.

When the place gets really crowded it takes a little longer to get a seat but it never takes too long. They have a restroom that's usually clean, the temperature inside is a little cooler than room temperature. Also, the décor is so cute inside and the employees are all amazing and super friendly! 

All in all, best boba place in Tampa! (and possibly the world)."

I realllly love milk teas. Whether it be Matcha aka finely ground Green Tea or Thai Tea, I love milk teas! The cool thing about this place is their shaker! A special machine that shakes the milk teas to perfection! Finally the teas wouldn't be complete without what makes them unique, the boba. Boba is tapioca, solidified into spheres and then sweetened usually with honey. Chewy little sweet snacks to accompany your awesome milk tea! They also have popping boba that are filled with juice and pop when you bite them. Both are great, but nothing beats a good milk tea with original brown, honey sweetened chewy boba.

Make a u-turn right out of the parking lot of those ""other"" Indianapolis breweries and head to Bier for some of the best craft beer this state has to offer. 

I've been complaining for quite a while about the lack of creativity shown by most breweries around here. The same beers over, and over, and over.  You can throw that tired formula out the window now. These guys are bringing it with much more than the usual IPA, wheat, amber, and porter. 

You like dunkles? How about two different dunkles on draft, one made with rye? Will that work for you? How about a smoked brown, a Belgian pale, or a stout that was recently named the best in the state at a local competition? Oh, cream ale is your thing? Stop on in for a delicious brew that kicks the ass of that ""other"" cream ale in town.

The people at the deli are quite helpful.  However, I have had less than helpful experiences.  Most recently, I was looking for cilantro.  I found an employee and asked if she could help.  She asked a manager, who let me know that he had both fresh and dried cilantro.  When I asked him if he would mind showing me where the fresh cilantro was kept (since I couldn't find it) he walked to the produce section and asked another worker, who replied ""we're all out.""  Instead of offering to show me to the dried cilantro (which they had none of anyway), or let me know when they might receive fresh stock, he told me, ""well, cilantro is the same thing as parsley, anyway.""  Then proceeded to walk off.  Pardon?  If that were the case, then cilantro would be called parsley, would it not?

Atmosphere: This Dutch Bros is a fun one because, while they may have more staff members on hand during the busy shifts, it seems like they keep the music more low-key with the volume down. I REALLY appreciate that! The drive-thru line, if it gets long, is a bit hard to drive around as the lot set-up is a little weird, but it's not anything to detract me from going back.

Service: Fast, easy service. These guys try as hard as they can to move the line through and it's greatly appreciated!

Food,4.0,CG,"Totally worth a stop. We had an amazing time and will be back. Thank you!Very rude. Went in at around 3:15pm and they had a sign on the door that said it was closed. It was not a sign on the door. This is the first time I've been to a Starbucks with a sign saying open until 11. So I walked out. I asked for a coffee and she said yes. I asked for a muffin and she said I had to have it before I got my drink. I said I don't want muffins, she just said ""no"". I asked her for a muffin and she said ""it's not ready. I'll be right with you. "" I said to her she said ""no. "" She said I had to have it. I asked for a muffin. I said no and she said ""no"" and walked away. When I went to get my drink I noticed a sign stating that they were closed. This is how you treat customers and they don't want to be there."
Food,3.5,CG,I live 20 steps away and have been craving ice cream for a long time. I was excited to find this place. The place is small and is a little tight. The ice cream is pretty good. It's in a very cool strip mall. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice. I ended up going with the waffle cone and it was a little over $6 for a waffle cone. I was happy to get a waffle cone. I got the chocolate chunk and the vanilla bean. The waffle cone was very good. The ice cream is very creamy and has a nice flavor. I really liked the waffle cone. I also liked the waffle cone. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.They have the best service I've had at a Starbucks in the city. I have never been treated so poorly. They always have a smile on their face. The baristas are always so nice and their drinks are always right. I always come here and try to stop at least once a week to get some caffeine.I don't know what I'm
Food,4.0,OR,"Best Dive Bar in Tampa... hands down. Where else can you rub elbows with homeless people in a laid-back atmosphere? When you walk into the Hub you might be tempted to turn right around. It may make you feel like you are in the part of a crime show where something bad happens that they have to investigate.  It's harmless though. I love the cross section of people. You will find south Tampa types, an older crowd, hipsters and homeless people all coexisting in the smokey, juke box  music filled cave. There's a fooseball table but be prepared to wait. There is always a line of people waiting for a turn. My personal favorite is the Galaga machine.

They have really strong, cheap drinks but I prefer the $3 PBR tall boys. I don't know if that's because I liked PBR or something about this venue leads me to think I like PBR, 90s rock and second hand smoke.

I went in on a random Saturday and discovered the band, Red Rockits. They are amazing and it was the perfect venue to see them. If you ever find out they are playing, GO, and then let me know!

If you are looking for a change in pace you should definitely check out the Hub. Bring Cash, they don't take credit cards!"
Food,4.5,OR,"I'd rank H&C as one of the best coffee shops in Indy. They roast beans off-site in SoBro and they are obsessively fresh - bags are dated with the roast date and are pulled off the shelf after two weeks.  You'll have a hard time finding fresher beans with this much selection.

If you're in the mood for brewed coffee, get one of their single-origin beans made in the Clover.  They're one of the very independent shops in the country to have a Clover brewer, so take advantage and try something new!  If you're in the mood for something with milk and you've only ever had Starbucks latte's, try a traditional Cappuccino or a Flat White to see what a real barista can do.  They also have large selection of high quality teas if that's your calling.

Baked goods are best bought in the morning - fresh baked every day but they don't keep well. Atmosphere is alright, a long narrow shop that can feel either incredibly busy or barren.  The local art has been rotating a bit faster these days which helps, and the music selection here has gotten significantly better.  A note for some reviewers - any shop that's playing Spotify or Pandora is breaking the law. Just a little pet peeve of mine."
Food,4.0,CG,"There's a cute new donut shop in the Reading Terminal Market.

The staff is friendly and the donuts are very fresh. The donuts are fresh and tasty. The donuts are worth the visit. It's a little pricey for a donut but worth it.Great location.  Staff is friendly.  I like that they are open 24 hours.  It's great to have a locally owned coffee shop nearby.  The coffee is good and the staff is very friendly.  I recommend this place.I've been here twice, and I haven't had a bad experience.  The first time, I ordered a couple of donuts and my husband ordered a breakfast sandwich.  Both were delicious.  The second time, he ordered the breakfast sandwich and I had a pastry.  Both were excellent, but I'd rather not get a breakfast sandwich.  I'll go back to get the breakfast sandwich next time I'm in the area.

The first time, the sandwich was very good.  The second time, it was way too hot and dry. "
Food,3.5,CG,"I can't believe I'm the only one in the area. I will be going back!Very rude. Went in for the first time yesterday.  The lady behind the counter was very rude.  She had no idea what to do.  I asked if she could help me and she said no.  I was standing there and she looked at me and said I was so busy.  I just walked away and went to the register to go get some ice cream.  I'm not sure if I'll be back, but I will be back.This is a great little local spot.  The staff is friendly, and the place is laid back.  We were there on a Saturday night, and there was a huge selection of beers and wine.  We were also able to get a few bottles of their hard liquor from the cooler.  My husband and I stopped in and had a beer and a bottle of the Riesling.  We also had some really good cider and cider and the staff was friendly.  We will be back to try some of the beers!I"
Food,5.0,OR,"A highly specialized artisanal butcher is finally in Tucson!!!  Now, Ben Forbes has been providing amazing meat products to Tucson for several years, and he does it so well.  His shop is now located downtown behind Thunder Canyon Brewery, so it is super convenient to shop there.
He is also a wonderful steward of meat products, knowing where all of his products come from.  He supports the local 4H by buying their animals for processing and sale, as well.  From Wagyu steaks to Kobe hot dogs (not kidding - these are the best hot dogs I've ever had!) to specialty sausages, Forbes has it all.  Before every camping trip, I visit his shop to pick up a Wagyu steak and those amazing hot dogs, and I am never disappointed.  Oh, and the bacon is better than any bacon I've tried.
He also takes special orders (I've ordered pork crown roasts from him for Christmas celebrations, and they are so good).  He also raises his own hogs, and he does so completely humanely.  He is able to offer advice on how best to prepare the products he sells, as well.  
I can never say enough great things about Mr. Forbes and his shop, as I know what I am buying is going to be perfect."
Food,4.0,OR,"This is such a serene spot with all the good Cali vibes that you would expect. This spot is located on Stearns Warf and has such a welcoming atmosphere. You can choose to do a glass, bottle, or flights of wine while sitting outdoors and taking in the sun (or in our case, some clouds - but still beautiful). You'll likely see some dolphins swim by too which just adds to the experience, but back to the wine. We wanted to taste as much as we can without getting too tipsy so we each got a flight - 1 of the Deep Sea Reserve and the other of the Conway Reserve. If you're into the more mild/fruity flavors, go with the Deep Sea Reserve. If you're into reds, go with the Conway. I'm not a wine connoisseur but I didn't taste a wine I didn't like. We ended up buying a bottle of the Conway Pinot Noir. So good. I would have given this place 5 stars if they had snacks or small plates, but either way, I'd recommend this spot for sure. I went with one of my girl friends and it was the perfect place to relax and catch up. Tip: Be sure to say hi to the pup that is also a part of this family operation."
Food,4.0,CG,"I first visited this place on a trip to the beach. We had a small group of friends here and we had a great time. The staff was friendly and the wine was great. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view. The only negative was that we were not greeted by the bartender. Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a good beer. This place is a must try if you're in the area. This is my favorite coffee shop in the Philadelphia area. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The coffee is always perfect and the pastries are always good. They also have a great selection of baked goods. They do a great job of offering to make your coffee delicious. This is the only place I've had a pastry that I have found that I have never tried before. I haven't tried their baked goods yet but I'm excited to try them!What a great place to go for a relaxing afternoon. We went during the day and had a great time. Our server was very friendly and attentive."
Food,4.5,CG,"Even though this place is a little more expensive than other places in town, it's worth the extra mile from where I live. The ice cream is the best, the place is clean and the staff is friendly. Definitely a place to come for some frozen yogurt!It was a lot of fun to watch the line go by and get a free beer after having some beers. I got a flight of 4 beers and I chose the 4th. The pretzel was good, but the pretzel was a little too salty for my liking. I'll definitely be back, but I wouldn't recommend it. The ice cream is really good! The staff is super friendly and the flavors are awesome! I got the cookies and cream and my son got the Oreo. Definitely a place I will go back to!This place is pretty awesome! I was going to buy my son a birthday cake here, but I was not able to finish my order. I ordered the chocolate cake for a friend's birthday and it was delicious. The cake was moist and moist and the cake was well-tasted."
Food,3.5,OR,"Usually I go to this Starbucks often, and it's pretty good. But this time it was really bad, like REALLY BAD. The lady taking my order was nice and helpful, but the lady who made the drinks did an awful job. It tasted rancid almost. Same thing with my boyfriend's drink, they tasted the same type of gross. I couldn't even drink it, it was so bad. I'm sure the girl making it was new but still- if you're making drinks you should know what you're doing. I was extremely disappointed and am praying next time I come here my drink tastes better. The cake pop was really good though. Anyways, I called them to complain about the drinks being super bad, and no answer. So then I called again, still no answer. I called FIVE TIMES AND NO ANDWER!!! I was furious. So we drove back and complained and apparently they ""don't take calls after business hours""! I'm sorry but if the same number calls you five times in a row YOU ANSWER!! Anyways, the lady who remade our drinks, Heather, did a fantastic job and I am pleased. Heather and her drink making skills are the only reason that I'm giving 2 stars, otherwise it would be 1 for sheer lack of customer respect and improper drink training on employees."
Food,4.0,OR,"The process is bumpy and unclear. I should have read the last and most recent reviews on this winery. It may be helpful if they have a greeter or host that goes over the process and then lead you into the tasting room. Maybe a queue of sorts so it's clear who's next. You can leave literature about the process, just something better than what's going on today. After standing at the counter for about five minutes someone acknowledged me and said they'll be right with me. OK they were slightly busy and I can roll with it. The person that helped us was nice enough but unlike other wineries they lacked the necessary enthusiasm to encourage me in making a purchase. Based on the mediocrity of the product they need to do a better job of talking it up because the taste and quality is not a driver.

The outside ambience is set up nicely spaced out tables with umbrellas. It's the perfect set up for the Thursday night series of wine and music. Since I am not a white wine drinker I can't get a fair critique so I will move on to the Cabernet which I found to be flavorless without body almost watered down. The cheese board and spinach dip was just OK. Overall this was a overpriced bust."
Food,3.5,CG,"Ok, if any of you are an IPA fan, you know that I am a fan! 

The food is delicious. The fries and fries are amazing, and the fries are sooo good. 

The beer is good. If you are looking for something refreshing, the best option is the beer porter. It is a great way to start a day off. They have a great selection of beer, as well as some guest taps. 

The service is great. I would highly recommend the outdoor patio, as it is super quiet, and is usually a great spot to hang out. 

I have been here several times, and I am very happy I did. I love the atmosphere. I can't wait to go back and try some more.I am a huge fan of the new Yummy Bubble Tea in Reno. The location is convenient to my home and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I like the variety of teas they offer and the fact that they are known for their teas. My favorite is the teas of the week, mango"
Food,3.5,CG,"Second visit, the first was a little disappointing. First off, it was kind of a slow day. We waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes and the person who took our order was nice. The other person who waited on us was extremely rude. This was our first time coming here and we felt uncomfortable as we were waiting for our coffee. There was a line out the door and it moved very quickly. The person who took our order was very friendly and gave us a couple of suggestions for our drinks. I'm not sure if he was just annoyed that we were waiting for our drinks and he was really nice. I really liked the coffee though because of the natural light. I'll be back for sure.This place is my favorite coffee shop in the area. I've had a few bad experiences here. I have been waiting for the owner to open a new location. He is amazing, he always has the best recommendations and will even let you try them. The atmosphere is chill and the baristas are great. The atmosphere is very welcoming. I love that it and would be a great for families"
Food,4.5,OR,"This may be the one review that when i gave it 5 stars i would literally agree with woohoo as good as it gets.

The premise of this boutique brewpub is ahead of its time. Local guys putting out a great product. I had the pleasure to get to VI early and got to spend a good deal of time talking with the owners. Very approachable and willing to share information about the beer, their process and just have a good conversation. Everything about this place is great. Location is right on the main drag in Mt Holly. The bar itself has a great old charm to it yet is very spacious to fit a ton of people there. The price structure/token system is very reasonable...which leads me to the beer. 

The quality of the beer this place is putting out is second to none. They have nailed every beer style they had on tap when I was there. I may have to put the brewers under a polygraph to believe that their tripel is more than 5%. No hot alcohol, no boozy aftertaste, just crisp belgian flavor and a nice alcohol sweetness to finish. 

This place also has a great answer to my happy hour hunger. The pizza place across the street will gladly deliver to their neighbors. 

Definitely a new beer destination."
Food,2.0,OR,"Whenever I have a new beer I truly enjoy, I think, wow, if there's this one that I've never had before that's this good, I bet there are even more out there like it. But I've also been introduced to beers that just don't cut it, so when I discovered Craft Beer Club, where they suffer the bad beers so we don't have to, I was hopeful. So I get 4 different styles of beer, 3 bottles each -- every month, and it's true, the beertasters at CBC do not send the stuff that's not so good from the nearly 2,000 small breweries in the U.S. Just because they're called ""craft"" and they have a clever name and a cute label doesn't mean they actually know what they're doing. Okay, one of the 4 is usually too light for me, but I'm biased toward porters and stouts, so your mileage may differ. But my wife has consistently liked the lighter beers, so they're not going to waste. And they are definitely from breweries I've not heard of or aren't likely to get to any time soon even if I want to (Key West!). And one month I got beers from our hometown brewery, Santa Fe Brewery, and they did pick well. A great gift, a great way to one-up your beer snob friends!"
Food,2.0,CG,"I know it's Walmart.... but this place is the worst. I will never shop here again. If you go to this Walmart... you will be told by the manager ""you can't go to this Walmart"".  It's a total scam.This place is really good! I had the Banana foster and it was really good! I also got the Vanilla Bean with coconut milk. It was very good. It had a very creamy texture and the coffee was smooth and flavorful. Definitely recommend!I've been to this store a few times.  I love that they have a parking lot in front and a couple other spots.  The employees are super friendly and helpful.

I had to wait at the pharmacy for over an hour to get my prescription.  I had to wait 20 minutes to get the prescription.  I had to wait for the pharmacist to come and call me back and get it.  She was extremely rude to me and rude.  I will never go back."
Food,1.5,CG,"Awful. My friend and I go here at least once a week. We always have to wait 30-45 minutes for the same thing, and they're always out of the same thing. We go to this store because we love it. The one thing I really don't like is that the workers don't really know what to do, which is weird because they are so so busy. They make my drinks, but I'm sure it's because they don't want to be there. The only reason I go here is because they're too busy, which is why I never feel like I'm being interrupted by a long line. They also have a lot of great baked goods. They do have some other items and they're also very good for those of us who don't want to eat. My only gripe is the parking lot is a bit of a hassle. I'd rather drive to a mall and have the same experience. I've been to this location a few times and they always have a lot of good stuff, but lately they were out of the most popular items that I needed."
Food,3.5,OR,"I'm so bummed to see all these low ratings. Unfortunately, it seems like most people are disappointed by the higher prices at Whole Foods. I can understand that many people have families to feed and sometimes Whole Foods isn't the friendliest on the pocketbook. However, I hope that people can stop and really think about what they are paying for. Whole Foods has been dedicated to supporting local businesses and local economy for years. They really pioneered this movement. They try to source as much product locally, whether it's dry food, fresh produce, lotions or soap! Sure, some things come from California or are imported, but let's not forget we do live in a globalized economy. For example: the organic blueberries you buy here are no more expensive than Safeway or AJ's. I know we are all  looking for a good deal, but no one ever said buying good quality was cheap! I spent over $10 dollars at the farmers market on a handful of Zucchini Flowers...I was a little shocked, but to me it was worth it to support a local vendor. Things I love at Whole Foods:  I love their salad bar and picking up a hot meal when I'm too lazy to cook. Their cheese selection is excellent. Did I mention they have an excellent gluten free selection too!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I started going to Z'otz probably about 8-10 years ago and it still is my favorite coffee shop anywhere. The inside is made up of a number of separate rooms, which is great because you can typically find a spot as a table in an environment that suits you. The very back room is typically more quiet and has students in it. 

To some, the decor--which is darker and more unconventional-- can be strange. I personally love the decor of Z'otz. It gives a funkier, edgy vibe, unlike the chains that all look the same and boring.

Nondairy enthusiast rejoice! Not only do they have soy milk, they also have almond-- both plain and vanilla. And unlike most places, you are required to pay extra for the non-dairy milks. Most people I know that love Z'otz believe it has the best iced coffee in the city, and I agree. I also recommend trying the Zombie or White Zombie and their lattes. While not all of their tea is loose leaf, the variety is pretty extensive. I also like that they have a ton of Monin flavors, so I can get many different Italian sodas. Try the toasted marshmallow! 

One last note-- if you are working on a computer, make sure to ask for the wifi password everytime you come in. The wifi password changes daily."
Food,4.5,OR,"Pretty much anywhere that I can order a basket of pickles and chips alongside some creative small batch beer is excellent in my book. I can't believe I've lived down the street from here for months and only recently checked this place out! It was packed when we came, late afternoon on a Saturday. 
Crime and Punishment has a totally awesome Russian theme going on, and some really creative and tasty beers to go along with that theme. There is a Grodziske, where in the description of the brewing it is suggested it tastes like ""sausage lemonade."" I was thinking, wait a second, beer shouldn't taste like that! But who am I to say what beer should and shouldn't taste like?! This beer tasted exactly like sausage lemonade. I can't believe I'm saying that, but it's true. There is also a beet beer which is surprisingly delicious, a brown ale, a Belgian strong dark, and a single hop ale. And many others. 
I am honestly impressed by what they are doing here in this small space on Girard ave. I really want to come back and eat more of that delicious eastern European food and taste new beers. There are pierogies and borsht calling my name on Girard ave, and kinda like the sausage beer, that is not something I thought I'd ever say."
Food,4.5,CG,"We came here on a weekend afternoon and the line was out the door! The guy working the front was so nice and the place was clean and inviting! We got the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was delicious! I would definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!I love love this place. They have the most delicious ice cream in the area. I've had the cheesecake ice cream, and I love the salted caramel. I like that they have a ton of flavors to choose from, and the staff is friendly. I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but I've found some of the flavors to be a little too sweet. I'd recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough, and the salted caramel. It's a cute little shop and I'll be back!Went to this location today with my boyfriend.  We decided to go to the Starbucks on the other side of the street.

Food,3.5,CG,Hidden gem in South Phillly! We have been going here for years now and always have a great experience. I've had the best experience of a Walgreens ever. I was in and out of there within 10 minutes. The staff was extremely helpful. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. I was amazed at how fast the staff was and how fast the check out process was. I went to pick up some random items and they didn't have a single item I was looking for. I went back to the store and was told they had one. I was so amazed that they didn't have one. So I went back to the store and asked if they had any. I was told they don't have one. I went back to the store to ask for it and was told they had one. I went back to the store and was told that they had one and they had one. I was so shocked that I thought it was strange that they didn't have one. So I went back and they had two different brands. They didn't have one and I didn't find one.
Food,4.5,OR,"It feels like home.

Fritz's Frozen Custard is a Florissant institution.  As I've mentioned before, I grew up in Florissant, and I was raised on Fritz's turtles!  Quality frozen custard, covered with hot fudge, caramel, pecans, and a cherry on top!  If I didn't have money for the turtle, I would just order a plain cone, white or chocolate, and they would stack that custard up to the sky!  And I would be a happy boy.

Now I realize that I have already proclaimed Ted Drewe's the frozen custard king.  Nonetheless, that proclamation doesn't take away from what Fritz's does.  It's hard to compete with royality, but proximity plays a big part of my love for this custard stand.  Chippewa was a long way from my home in Florissant, so why drive twenty miles for custard when it was already in my backyard?

Still, Fritz's doesn't disappoint.  Their product is great.  It is one of the few thing that I miss about living in North County, the others being Pirrone's Pizza and Old Town Donuts.  With my parents still holding strong in Flotown, I make it a priority to enjoy these three establishments whenever possible.

If you live in North County, you already know about these wonderful places.  If not, check out Fritz's and have yourself a turtle!"
Food,4.5,OR,"Stopped by for some drinks, and to take a look next door at the brewing supplies. They sell plenty of wines, ciders, and meads here, and of course, they have these on tap to taste, as well as two featured beers.

You can get a flight of four for $5 (of wine and/or cider) which is such a great deal. The ciders were very tasty, we tried the Wild [Blood] Orange and the Vino Cider Rose- the first was semi sweet, and the second was dry. They were both very refreshing and flavorful. We also tried the Obsidian (the maker's favorite) which was unique, and the Old Vine Zin, which was also pretty good. Service was very informative and friendly. You can mix ciders and wines in the flight, but you cannot mix either of those two with the meads. We opted not to taste any meads today.

They also have events throughout the month, which are posted on the wall. Your best bet is to reserve a spot ahead of time. Some of the events are free, such as bingo night and trivia, while some may have a price (wine and cheese making class). Overall, great little place. My only complaint is there is a very limited supply of beer to taste. We'll probably be back sometime once they've got new things to taste on tap."
Food,4.5,CG,"I was told by many people that the only reason I was in the mood for a fruit smoothie is because I had to get a smoothie with the flavor of the day. This is not the case. It was just a bad experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone.I was looking for a quick stop for a quick coffee and pastry while visiting the beach. I walked in and was surprised to see that there was a small seating area with a few tables and chairs. 

The young lady who helped me was very nice and helpful. She was able to answer any questions I had about the coffee. She was also very kind and helpful. 

I ended up getting a chai latte. I loved it! It was a bit of a warm day, but it was still very good. I didn't get a bite of it. I'll definitely be back.

I have been looking for a bakery for a while.  We stopped by on a whim and decided to stop by.  I was looking for a bakery to hang out with friends and I was pleasantly surprised by the selection.  I tried the chocolate cake donut and it was delicious.  My favorite."
Food,4.0,OR,"Sugar Drop is such a fun store! I love going here instead of the huge big box stores for my baking supplies. Shopping local is so much better! The shop is small but they have all the basics and great selections of unique cookie cutters and sprinkles. They are also great for tips and advice on whatever you want to make. I showed them a picture of a cake I'm going to try out and they gave me a few pointers. 

Recently I was in looking for a cancer ribbon cookie cutter. A very nice woman helped me find it (of course it was right in front of my face!) and asked me what I was making cookies for. I explained I had a manager at work with ovarian cancer and that we were making cookies to raise some money to help her out with the costs. We talked for a bit, and she left as I checked out. As I finished up, the woman came back and gave me $10, saying she wanted to pay it forward and be the first to donate because she had just gone through breast cancer treatment. I was so touched by her generosity! It's little things like this that make me love supporting local business. The customer service and care from the lovely ladies at Sugar Drop is amazing!!"
Food,4.0,OR,"I think this place deserves more credit than given on Yelp! They caught our attention since a live band was playing both nights we visited State Street! You can stand on the sidelines (and out of the walk way) to enjoy the live music for free. However, you won't be able to purchase drinks. You can also pay a cover fee of $8 per person to be seated in their closed off, out door section to vibe out and enjoy drinks. I don't think the cover fee was that bad. After all, you're basically enjoying a live performance. People pay hundreds of dollars to enjoy their favorite artists, why can't we pay a couple of dollars to support local bands and a local bar? 

I also think drinks were normal price, no more or no less than what other restaurants/bars charge (I think). I enjoyed a whiskey mule with thyme in it for the first time! What an elegant and unique touch. 

On Sunday, the singer mentioned that the owner of Music Alley opened the place in 2019 (don't quote me) and was able to keep the place throughout shutdown! I think that's amazing, so that people like us can enjoy the concept the owner had envisioned even after the hard times in 2020/2021. 

If musically inclined people turn you on, this place is for you!"

If you are in the area, they have the best wine in town.I was so excited to see this place open in the same strip mall. I was so happy to have found it. It's a small, small, industrial type store and it has a very nice layout. I was surprised to see the beer selection was extremely small, but it was well stocked and priced. 

The staff were very friendly. I liked the fact that they let you sample beers before making a purchase. They also had a wide variety of canned and bottled beers that were sold on their shelves. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique beer to try.This is a great bakery!  I have been looking for a bakery for a while.

Food,4.5,OR,"I am a HUGE graeter's fan and have been since encountering it several years ago. I was so excited about them opening a location in Indianapolis that on one of the coldest days this year (in the worst winter I can remember), I made a bunch of family members go with me to the store. I don't like to oversell because that can create unjustified expectations, but you cannot help but gush about how wonderful and delicious Graeter's is (and how it is the best ice cream in the world!!). (Some members of my family were highly skeptical. ) 

While I would absolutely give the ice cream 5 stars (made the same way since 1870, 2 gallons at a time; creamiest ice cream ever), I have to give the store 4 stars because both restrooms were closed, which was inconvenient! I'm sure that something was beyond the owner's control, but he could have at least rented a portable restroom or something for his first week in business and the store's grand opening. The store is clean and also sells Jelly Belly products. There were fresh roses everywhere (we went 2 days after St. Valentine's Day). The people behind the counter were pleasant. It's quite a trek for me, but I will probably make the trip again soon. On average, it cost $4 per person. (Those skeptics in my family became believers."
Food,4.5,OR,"This is my very first time trying out Tsaocaa. I mean I heard about Tsaocaa few years ago from a friend but I never thought of trying them. Until Tsaocaa open another location in Hmart of Elkins Park. I frequent that Paris Baguette often, one day I decided to try Tsaocaa. 

First time I went, I remember it was their grand opening. It was like 3 guys working there. I don't know if it was a bad day, but all three guys aura were ""off"" in a way, pretty unwelcoming. Nonetheless, the Pineapple tea were still good. 

Second time, it was 2 girls and 1 guy working there. The guy say something to my hubby as if he knows him, usually Asians don't say anything to my hub at all, so that was unexpected but we like that. And the 2 girls were VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY! They didn't rush any of us when we placed our orders. Plus they even recommend something to my 6 year old. We got the Rose Milk Tea, Black Sugar Milk Tea, Colorful Tea, and Strawberry Slush. My family enjoy all of our drinks very much. We will be back!

Hubby wanna try their waffles but they were sold out. The girls told us their machine were down. I like that they were sympathetic about it, we will try that next time."
Food,4.0,CG,"As I end my days here, I go to this Walmart a lot, and I go to the other locations.  The people that work here are the most friendly and helpful.  The only thing I can complain about is that it's a little pricey.  But you get what you pay for.  I love the fact that they are open 24 hours.  It's great that they offer a few items that I can't find at Walmart.  It's very convenient if you want to stock up on something that you're not sure what to buy.

However, the last time I was there, I noticed that they have been out of my favorite items.  I ended up going back and got a $5 gift card for my family.  I've had a few bad experiences here, and the ones that I've had at this Walmart are very good.

I'm not a big fan of Walmart, and this one is convenient for me.  It's a small store, and I don't have to say it's bad, but I would prefer to find a different ones, and not to go"
Food,3.0,CG,"I have been using this location for the last two years. The first time we went, we had to get our medicine and then the next day when we were going to go to another store. I had to wait about an hour to get my prescription filled. I was also told it would be ready in the next day. I was told it would be ready in the next day. The next day, we went to pick up our prescription. I was told the prescription would be ready at 11:20. We went to pick up the prescription that was ready in the middle of the night. The second time, we were told it would be ready in 5 minutes. This is not the first time that I have been treated this way. I would have known better if I had known it was the same day. So, we went to pick up the prescription and waited about 20 minutes. The pharmacist made our way to tell us that she was going to call the next day."
Food,4.0,OR,"My first visit was on Mother's Day in the afternoon, and I was impressed...I will add it to my list of must-visit-regularly grocery stores because I like what they represent. I admit it would be very convenient if I could find ALL of my favorite brands in one super lower priced, giant superstore...but I don't like how that story unfolded, so Sprouts will be added to my regular round of smaller, less offensive, more friendly and socially responsible grocery stores to visit.

It was busy but we had no trouble finding parking; love the short shopping carts that helped making maneuvering through people and aisles easier. I decided to come on a whim with a friend, so I didn't have a shopping list or an agenda; I just found things that I had to have (that I really didn't), like organic/fair trade liquid soap, organic ""face energizer,"" real cane sugar sodas, and a large bag of milk chocolate covered almonds. I recognized brands and items I'd expected to find at a similar local market when it opened (because they'd offered those items in their sister store in California 25 years ago) and was happy to find them at reasonable prices here.

I really didn't get to explore the entire store, but I plan to go back soon and take a trip down every aisle and add to my review soon."
Food,3.0,OR,"I like this location because it's not as busy as other locations and the layout is better. There are 2 entrances/exits and they are spacious. Parking is abundant here too. There's a second level that's wheelchair/stroller accessible with a lounge overlooking the store and this location has a community room that you can book events or register for their culinary classes. Second level also has a walk in clinic for family medicine/general practitioner. Washrooms are on both levels too. I haven't been tried at other locations, but this one gives a free chocolate chip cookie to your kid at the bakery (great distraction so I can do more grocery shopping while they snack). Stock can be hit or miss (out of stock items or not the best looking produce), but I like the fact that they do flyer comparisons themselves and price match so that I don't have to.
It's usually organized whenever I shop here and I don't usually need to ask staff for help. Checkout time is alright and the self checkout staff are quick enough to be assisting before I flag them for help. 
I wish their drugstore cosmetics section would improve as it pales in comparison to the south common location. I've had no issues using their click n collect services either as they will confirm any substitutions if they're out of stock on something."

I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and freshness. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. I was looking for a quick stop for a quick coffee and pastry while visiting the beach. I walked in and was surprised to see that there was a small seating area with a few tables and chairs. The coffee is made by a local roaster who is very knowledgable about their coffee. I ordered a milk tea with oat milk and it was delicious! I ordered a iced mocha and a cappuccino. I got a caramel latte with oat milk and it was delicious. My friend got the peach lemonade. Both were good. I don't really like sweet drinks so this was my first time trying it. The shop is small and small but very clean. There is plenty of seating for customers to sit at the tables. The inside is also a very clean.
Food,3.0,OR,"So this is the first Liquor Store in Mullica Hill, and I was really looking forward to it as it would eliminate so much driving to other towns and such for the dinner party essentials. However, that being said, I really wish this place didn't exist at all. The layout of the place looks like you're shopping in the Grim Reaper's safety house. Additionally, the first time I went, it was mid week about a month ago, the staff was extremely rude and he was NO help to me in finding exactly what I needed. When I asked for help he sauntered out of his seat like I was a CHORE. Then, when I asked more questions about the liquor, he literally had no idea, and didn't care about answering either. Out of convenience, I decided to go the following week, around the same same time. Maybe they would have a different staff member working, my fingers were crossed. Hesitantly, I made my way into the liquor store and the staff behind the counter literally just looked at me.... no greeting, no ""How may I help you?"", nothing. So instead of buying something I just made my way around the store and left without buying anything. Their variety isn't great at all anyway. Overall, I learned that driving a further distance is worth it if I'm avoiding this place."
Food,4.0,OR,"Woodwright brewing company is located right off main street and skinner in downtown Dunedin, in the greater Tampa Bay area close to many other Dunedin breweries. Woodwright brews 11 ales locally in house. We got a flight of 4 brews including the Mandarina which had citrus undertones, Belgian blonde, hefeweizen, and sour Gose. All were very good. They were playing some incredible indie and alternative rock like ""I got soul, but I'm not a soldier"" by the Killers, fix you by Cold Play, Hozier, Mumford and sons, little monsters, and other great alt rock hits. There us only 4 parking spots available in their parking lot buy the bartender said we could Park at the bike shop across the street. Woodwright had a nice handy man carpentry feel with a circular table saw blade outside, a hammer on the door handle, upside down Christmas tree hanging, wood leaf pendant lights, pictures of various tools, raw exposed wood, and a nice wrap around natural light wood deck with umbrellas. The bar was pretty busy but the bartender helped us pick out drinks right away without any wait and was super friendly. I was a little disappointed Woodright didn't have a wheat or chocolate stout.

They had a few TVs outside which was nice. I would come back to try some of the other beers. I ended up going with the Pilsner and it was a little sweet. I liked the Pilsner and it was pretty strong. I also got a ginger beer which was very tasty. I'd definitely recommend trying it out if you're in the area. I'm from California and have been to a lot of boba places. I love to get boba in my area and this was a huge success. It's a cute little shop and has a good variety of boba. I got the lychee with boba. It was good but not amazing.

Food,3.5,OR,"So the place is absolutely grand! The way they have thought things through is great. However, it was so noisy in there because of the acoustics. Maybe it was just the excitement of it just being open, but I could barely hear the intercom over the band playing music to celebrate the grand opening. 

They layout is kind of small, but that's what most downtown area businesses look like, wherever you are. But the place is very nice and has a Whole Foods-esque feel to it, with a wine bar upstairs. As an interior design student I was very intrigued with how they did things. The way of having the cash registers all facing towards each other got pretty chaotic, especially at a new store at the time. It must be nice for the cashiers to see each other rather than the back of their heads though!

All in all, it was a great store. I met people who are locals in the area explaining how wonderful it was to have a nice grocery store they can just walk to. I also met people from out of town, which is also nice to know people who don't know the area well can feel alright picking up food at an unfamiliar grocery store. Schnucks revitalized the downtown grocery store business and social scene and brought it to a whole new level! :)"

Food,4.0,OR,"If Datz does creative takes on burgers, sandwiches, and comfort food; then Dough does the equivalent for dessert. This place definitely has some of the most unique desserts you can find in Tampa. Sure you have your regular ice cream and doughnut flavors. But how often can you find Fruity Pebble Doughnuts or Butterbeer Ice Cream? Probably not often unless you come here. I swung by here after eating dinner next door and got some cookies and cream ice cream and some cold brewed coffee. Normally cookies and cream ice cream is probably more cream than cookie. But here, it's the opposite. You actually have a good ratio of cream to cookie, especially when you get large chunks of whole cookies in your ice cream. It's what makes it so good because you have this fantastic contrast between crunchy cookie and smooth ice cream. Now when I talk about smooth, I can't skip out on the cold brew. Even without cream, the coffee was really smooth with a pleasant bitterness but no unpleasant lingering flavors. Unlike a lot of other places, Dough doesn't fill your cup full of ice to the point where your coffee is watered down. Here, you get a good balance of ice to liquid so you can stay cool while getting the impact of the caffeine. Will I be back? Most definitely. You can count on it."
Food,4.5,OR,"What a gem this place is! It gets strong nostalgia points because it reminds me so much of a great used-book/used-record store in Denton, TX (Recycled Books). That wouldn't be the case, though, if they weren't both great. Mojo is a deceptively spacious place with a charming maze of (of course) used books and records mostly, but there are the odd used toys and cool novelties, too. The staff has always been very nice. My limited buyings and sellings tell me that they give a fair price for used books and, likewise, sell at good prices. The coffee is decent. The baked goods, from small, independent bakers around town, I gather, are often excellent. Perhaps my favorite thing, from among the many excellent things, about Mojo is the music selection that the staff has to play. It's like an ideal mix of old favorites that I hadn't heard in years and new (to me) esoteric stuff that piques my interest and makes me want to learn more about it. I can usually go there to get a coffee and a pastry, see what cool tunes they'll surprise me with, and do some research/teaching prep for a while. 

Mojo seems to embody everything good about small business. I'm grateful that it still seems to be getting by in these difficult and weird economic times. I hope that it continues to do so."
Food,4.5,OR,"5 stars for the best rum tasting tour I've ever been on! We decided to try this place out and made it to the last tour of the day at 4 pm. The tour cost $15 per person.

We started the tour with a trivia game where anytime we answered a question correctly we were rewarded with a drink. A lot of it was history related and let's just say the boyfriend was winning by a long shot (he's such a nerd and I love it). I've done many others tours before and it was a fun interactive way to start out.

The location itself is on the small side. Our tour guide Bob was very knowlegable and answered all of our questions. He was open to hearing our opinions on other rums or liquiors.

We walked through the back area of see how the rums are barreled, how the alcohol is made and the bottling process. 

I can't believe all the different labels created on these bottles. I liked how the label is more similar now so that it's easily recognizable in the store but adding a little different art on the back label. I really enjoyed the spiced rum, much better than Captian Morgan. My close second would be the Gingeroo, even better if you mix them together!

All around one of my favorite tours I've been on, I definitely recommend a visit!"
Food,3.5,CG,"This newly built Starbucks is a real shame. It is a bit more of a drive through than the other locations.  The drive through is also very slow.  There is no seating inside, and it is not in a very busy area.  This location is still very clean.

I do recommend this location, and will continue to come back.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I did not think the coffee was good.  It was too bitter to drink, and it tasted a little bitter.  It was very bitter, which is why I chose to give it four stars.  However, I was not impressed with the service.

Food,4.5,OR,"This might be my second home.  When they first opened years ago, I was afraid to come here.  I thought it was some weirdo place that would cost an arm and a leg.  I am so happy that I ventured in, and that they eventually expanded as well. Now, as a mom dealing with food allergies, this is my go-to grocery store.  I do most of my shopping here--the prices beat Whole Foods into the ground, comparatively.  Lots of organic selections, not quite as much junk as a regular store.  Plus, what other place will open up the food for you to try right there if you're not sure you want to buy it?

The staff here is awesome.  Like any other TJs I've been to, it can get crowded, and people go in to this weird zone when shopping there.  They randomly stop in the middle of aisles and read packages or simply stare.  Seasoned vets know what they want and where it is.    I highly recommend not going anytime after 11:30 am, and definitely not on weekends.  I don't like crowds personally.  Monday morning at 9?  You will breeze right through!  And you can even stop and read stuff in a TJs induced haze if you need to, and people can still walk around you."

Food,3.0,OR,"This Target is easily one of the worst that I have ever been to. They only get two stars because of the exceptionally clean women's restroom. 

There are lots of factors I look for as a shopper and consumer.  Cleanliness of the store, product availability, customer service etc. This store failed horribly on all points.  

Imagine walking into a Target store on an episode of The Walking Dead and you'll get my drift here. There were so many empty spaces on the shelves, you could probably sleep on most of them. Product availability? Whats that here? Absolutely nothing.  Literally nothing on the shelves and if you did find something you needed, you'd have to use the price scanner because nothing was where it was supposed to be.  In every aisle were full carts of trash and misplaced items. It appeared as if the Rapture had taken place .  

None of the associates were doing anything but walking around talking about Love and Hip Hop. The one girl walked past me talking as if her friend wasn't standing right next to her.  I work in retail so I'm sure some of the associates were on a break but a store this size, Im certain they all weren't on break. 

Long lines, limited number of cashiers, filthy and understocked  store means I will not be a returning customer."
Food,4.5,OR,"This is a unique brewery, serving unique beers.  
They have 12 handles so many options on draft but imo all funky or sour selections.  

This is where the unique comes in, we tried the samplers so to hit as many choices as possible.  Funky greens IPA, Mixed Greens IPA, their watermelon gose and the bineary scale 2x IPA.  

They all were unique and different in both looks and taste, if you enjoy beer that tastes like not-beer then this is the place.  I believe it was the yeast strains and style they brewed in that made the differences per the info from the informative staff.  

I have no issues with a sour or unique flavor profile but really wanted a beer menu that was not all unique. I wanted to dabble in a taster and then return back to more mainstream craft selection of beer but that was not available at SG.   This lack of selection drove my rating.  

The staff was great - very informative, friendly and seemed to enjoy what they were doing and helping the constant flow of patrons.  

As you can see by their overall ratings they have a enthusiastic crowd that loves the uniqueness of their brews - if your taste or palate hasn't evolved you may want to stick with some of the other fine Nashville breweries."

I just wish they had more vegetarian options!Great experience, friendly staff, good selection of wine, and a friendly staff. You can tell they care about the products they carry, and it shows. We went here on a Saturday afternoon, and they had a lot of great wines to choose from, and I highly recommend going to a place like this if you're in the area. The only downside is that they are pretty expensive, but I'm happy to say that they are worth the money. We have been going to this store for years and have always loved the selection of produce and meat and the freshness of the staff. However, the prices for meat is high and service is always poor. This store is always out of low quality."
Food,3.5,OR,"Their fresh home-made ice cream is to die for. They have an assortment of flavors, as well as seasonal flavors (I'm personally a big fan of their key lime pie ice cream) that are all amazing. They will also let you test out the flavors if you wish!

If you end up loving a certain flavor so much, they actually have pre-packaged containers of the flavors in the fridge so you can bring some home...instead of having to come in every hour to grab another cup/cone.

Unlike other typical ice cream places, they sell their ice cream by weight, so it could get a little pricey if you buy mountain. Trust me though, it's totally understandable if you do end up doing that. 

The place itself is literally a farm, so you can rest assured that their ice cream is really made fresh. A few of my friends actually worked here so they let me in on it. 

Another thing that you have to try when you go here is the chocolate milk! I actually hate chocolate milk, but when my friend (who was working there at the time) suggested me to try it, I did and I did not regret it. It wasn't too overly chocolate-y and it was so creamy and smooth, but it wasn't thick. Every time I come here, I always bring a jug home.

They will make my medication, but I have to go to the pharmacy because it is closer to where I live. I will continue to shop at Rite Aid. They need to hire more people. They have a good selection of items, but the pharmacy is not very helpful. I'm sure I will continue to go to Rite Aid. I have had a few issues with the pharmacy, but I think they are just going to be difficult to fill. If you have a prescription that is not ready in 24 hours, you should not have to wait in line.

Unless you are the most oblivious human being alive, you MUST notice that people aren't responding to the rudeness of your staff ? So HIRE DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! There are a ton of jobless people out there who can put a, possibly fake, smile on their face for a few freaking hours of the day. Clearly, your current staff can't even muster a fake tolerance for your customers. It is not rocket science. You have what could have been consistent customers below commenting on how they attempted to be a regular of your establishment, that is new and needs that right now, and they were each and every time either over charged or treated horribly. Guess what, this is not okay. I suggest that you NJ people who tried to support your local business community, continue to cross the bridge here to Philly to get your bubble tea because I will bet this place closes in less than a year if the owner doesn't WAKE UP and smell the Taro."

(it was a takeaway tasting) The day of the wedding we had 3 staff members on site, they were all professionally dressed and incredibly well mannered. The food was hot and delicious. Many of our guests said that it was the best food they've ever had at a wedding. For $22 a head I really can't complain with that. We had SOOOO many leftovers I have enough ratatouille in the freezer for 10 dinners. The only downside of the service would have to be that they didnt come and pick up all the leftover dishes. It wasn't a huge deal to drop the dessert stuff back there but if we didn't have a truck it would have taken two carloads. 
Our catering bill came to just over $2500, this included all the food for 70 people, the chafing dishes, all cutlery and dishes, coffee service, and 3 staff members who were at the hall for about 4 hours. 
In the beginning, it was a little difficult to get a hold of them, but once I established that I was going to go with them, I recieved emails regularly and was always called back within a day after leaving a message.

I learned that the driver of the car was the ""best bartender ever""...at least that's what he said when he introduced the driver to his co-""worker"". 
I learned that they all love Fireball. 
That the driver really liked the chicken, bacon, ranch croissant...so much so that it made me want one...not that I could order.

Ten seconds later, a mysterious chef appeared from behind the kitchen curtain, slid a plate of free mini doughnuts onto the counter, and disappeared as smooth as KC and the Sunshine Band, leaving us all to gape in wonder at his benevolent gift of four fresh, hot balls of fried dough. I burned my mouth, but I don't care. Those things were DELISH. I could eat an entire bucket of the cinnamon sugar ones. It was a great first impression!

Afro lady asked if it was our first time in, which I always think is a great way to make a customer feel at ease in an establishment. Sometimes you walk into a new restaurant and feel judged for taking so long to order, you dig?

We really should have gone with the doughnuts. I don't know what long-dead spirit of disco possessed us, but we ordered a funnel cake to split between the three of us. Don't get me wrong, it was yummy, but it was nowhere near as pillowy and delicious as the doughnuts. I'll really need to venture out for a bucket of them at some point!

Walking in, I was immediately taken with the huge selection of fresh produce. They have a wide variety of everything you would want- and a large variety of peppers for all of your cooking needs. They have a fantastic bakery case full of Latin American goodies. One thing that stood out to me was stuffed cheese bread. Talk about a must have!

I also liked that they had a wide selection of neat looking cookies and snacks that I had never heard of, but looked delicious. They had this one thing that was a cookie sandwich filled with strawberry marshmallow. Although I was tempted, I didn't cave in, but I might have to go back and pick these up. As others have said, the meat section is incredible. If you are a fan of beef tongue, they have a whole pile of it. Go nuts. haha.

One section of this market that I will definitely be trying in the future is the cafeteria. Here you can get Latin American hot dishes of all types and there is a nice area where you can sit and eat. Everything seemed well priced and the tables looked nice and clean.

While this market isn't as lush with goodies as Ideal, I would definitely say that it's worth checking out, if you're in the area."
Food,3.0,OR,"Nice Starbucks location- convenient to a lot of things (City Park, Hynes school, etc.) and has everything you expect in a standard Starbucks (consistent coffee, efficient baristas, quick service, etc.)

Things that stand out about this particular Starbucks:

- lots of covered outdoor seating! On a nice day, this is a BIG plus- the fact that the outdoor area is covered makes a huge difference, too- you can go out there when it's pouring rain or hot direct sun and still stay comfortable. There's indoor seating too, including a counter along the windows if you're there on your own and just need a place to sit for a few minutes.

- Convenient parking- there are a few spots directly in front of the front door, and the neighborhood has lots of parking if the little lot is already full.

- Free Wi-fi....this is pretty common at coffee shops in town, but it's nice to know that yes, the wireless access is free here.

Obviously, Starbucks isn't a particularly local experience, but sometimes you just want a coffee drink that tastes the exact same as yesterday...so Starbucks it is. 

A slight bit of local interest is the ""Katrina line"" painted along the wall all around the outside of the coffee shop- this gives you an indication of how high the water was during the flood, just in case you were wondering about how much water this area of town got (hint- a lot!)"

We averaged no less than 1.5 grocery orders a week via Instacart and, when possible, curbside, This time I've gotta give a (another?) shout-out to the nest and seafood folks. They keep it well stocked with a variety of cuts (beef, pork, chicken, seafood) ""by the pound"" and small-small family sized packages.

Pre-marinated in a few sauces (we got Jerk and Black Garlic) at about $5 a pound, you can't find an easier more delicious meal. 

Convection baked these on a wire rack at 400 degrees for 45-50 minutes and they were perfect! I only wished I had some of the marinade to toss the wings in after!

Very torn between three and four stars given the quality of the experience here....but the place is called ""scoop"" so I feel the quality of the ice cream has to be primary.

When we walked in Rita's we were greeted by about 3-4 very friendly employees.  We didn't know what we wanted, and it took a minute to understand what they offer.  It is very tight inside (narrow & deep space), & I was glad it wasn't crowded or I would have been uncomfortable in there.

The interior I noticed is very lovely with stylish, yet comfy black chairs and checkered floor. Clean, but not sterile. You can either sit at the coffee bar or grab a table. My first visit I decided to sit outside (their outdoor location is great, even when raining because its covered) or inside. Today I sat inside. I've had their Vanilla Iced Latte once, and liked it, but was hoping to try something more unique (since this is what I look for in a coffee house). I had them add honey to my vanilla latte this time. I love how their coffees are bold in flavor, but not burnt tasting or over powering. The sweetness of the vanilla complemented the coffee well, but I loved how the honey added more complexity to the flavor. Kind of reminds me how my honey nut cheerios made my milk taste.

You see the look in the cashiers eyes, just hoping and praying the manager on duty will pop out of their invisible bubble to help them, but nope they have disappeared into the back break room and are too busy exploring the world of Narnia. 

Ugh and the pharmacy is even worse! The last time I was there, a guy in front of me was returning all these items or getting them discounted or something of that nature, BUT he was not picking up his drugs. Like I get you buying a couple of small items when you pick up your order, but to sit there and make the Pharm Tech discount everything and re-ring it all back in is not the place for the pharmacy. I actually couldn't pick up my order b/c after 15 minutes of waiting for this guy to get his act together, I was running late for work. Take that business to the front of the store, not the pharmacy."
Food,3.5,CG,"Many months ago, I tried to go to the store and was told by the cashier that the store is closed.  The store is open and is open 24 hours.  I go to the customer service desk and they tell me that they are closed.  I ask if they have the product I need and they say yes.  I ask if they had it and they tell me that I just need to call customer service.  They go to the customer service desk and tell me that it is ready.  I ask if they have it, they say yes, but I tell them that I don't have it.  They go to the customer service desk and tell me that they are closed.  I say I don't know if they would be able to answer the phone or not.    I go to the customer service desk and ask if they have it.  They said no.  I have been waiting in line for 25 minutes, and they just told me they are closed.  I get up and go to the customer service desk, tell them that I have a product and they are not in stock, I want to stock it and I can't be on my job."

I got the Nutella Latte with almond milk and it was good, but nothing special. I liked the coffee flavor and the texture of the espresso. I did get a medium latte with oat milk and it was good. It had a good flavor. But the coffee was way too sweet. I prefer the sweet coffee to sweet cream. I would definitely come back here for a latte. I'm a huge fan of Starbucks. I love their customer service and the atmosphere. It's a great place to come for coffee and to meet up with friends. There's free wifi and I've had a few issues with my order. It's very clean and the people are nice. The seating is pretty small, but that's not really the case here. It's pretty big and has a lot of seating. The interior is bright and modern. The seating is also pretty nice, so you can sit in the cafe and eat your coffee or sit and be in the back patio and enjoy the outdoor patio."
Food,4.5,OR,"Womp, womp, womp.....is probably the best way to describe this tour. 

The boyfriend and I were on our way home and we would pass by STL, so I decided why not drop by Budweiser for their tour! I love beer, breweries, and it is on the way home...so why not?!?!  The parking lot was pretty packed on a Monday afternoon. We were approached by the beer tour guides to see if we were interested in a tour. We ended up opting for the 10 dollar fresh day tour. There is a free tour, but with this tour you get a fresh bottle of Bud to bring home and the tour is longer. 

We killed time before our tour walking through their musuem. So when the tour began we were excited. To be honest, one guide was great while the other one seemed like he was reading everything from a script. 

As for beer samples,  you get two dixie cups of bud or bud light and a full glass of one of their beers at the end. Don't even ask for a refill cause you will get a big fat no. This tour pretty much sucked, since every brewery tour I've been on has allowed unlimited samples or at least 6 samples. Sure you get to see the Clydesdales horses, but overall this tour was lackluster. Well on the brightside, we got our bottle of bud wrapped up like a christmas gift."
Food,4.5,OR,"Came across this cute little cafe when we showed up at Yogorino next door to find out that they had closed for good. *sad face* Thankfully, Lil' Pop Shop was next door to fulfill my sweet cravings. 

The cafe is a lot bigger than I thought. When you walk in, there are steps on the right that lead into their dining area/lounge where you can hang out or even study. They have a variety of popsicle flavors & 2 different sizes; small & regular. In addition to popsicles, they serve coffee, lattes, & other baked goods. 

My BF had the Caramel Brownie & I had the Mint Chocolate. The mint chocolate tasted light & delicious. You can taste the fresh mint leaves they used to make it. It was definitely refreshing to eat. My BF's popsicle was tasty too. These are guilt-free sweets in my book. It doesn't taste fatty or overly sweet. Definitely made it on my top 5 for desserts in Philly. 

As for the customer service, the lady there was not very friendly. She had a BRF (look it up on Urban Dictionary if you don't know what I'm talking about lol). She didn't greet any incoming or outgoing customers. She was giving dirty looks at the kids and appeared to be impatient with customers deciding what to get. She didn't offer any help whatsoever. That's the reason for the 4 stars. Fix your face & fix your attitude lady."

The ice cream was amazing and I can't wait to try more flavors. If you're looking for something sweet, definitely go.I love this place!  I love the fact that it is a little far from my home, but I can still get a slice and slice of heaven!  I love the fact that it is locally owned and operated, so I will definitely be back for more!  I usually buy their chocolates from here, but recently they have been sold out.  It is a fun little shop that is now a bakery/bakery.  I can't wait to try their other flavors!Went here for the first time today and was impressed with the service and the food. The owner was very nice and informative.

The staff is always so friendly and the ice cream is delicious. The staff is always so nice and friendly. 

You can get a large scoop of ice cream if you want to share. You can also get 2 scoops of ice cream if you want to share with friends. 

We love supporting local businesses!This is a great place to get some work done or catch up with friends. They have a great selection of coffee, pastries, and muffins. They have a lot of outdoor seating and a few tables outside if you want to sit at. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet spot to study or read or do some work.This place is pretty awesome! I was going to buy my wife a birthday cake here, but I was not able to find a place to buy it, so I just bought a couple of small cakes and they were delicious!

Food,4.0,OR,"I am so glad that Fabio, the idiot at this location showed me how much little respect TJ's employees can show their customers. Thanks to this dunce, who hides his fears behind his tattoos on his forearms, I stopped shopping at TJ's after 30 years and now go to Sprouts. I knew about Sprouts but somehow never shopped there. Now, I do and also hate myself for having wasted thousands of dollars at TJ's after realizing that everything at Sprouts is better and less expensive.
I have been shopping at Sprouts for some time now and truly appreciate their superior products.
Not only that but I save money too. Around 12-15% to be exact every time I go there. That extra $30-40 I get now every month, helps me filling up my car with gas. 
If you're like me, a senior citizen and a veteran and pretty much buy the same foods every week, switch from TJ's to Sprouts. You will get the same amount, as good or better and save money. 
Yeah, screw you TJ's and tell your bully Fabio not to put their hands on your customers like he did with me. I dare you putting your hands on the elderly ever again! Obviously he never got punished for assaulting people but that could change anytime. 
Physically assaulting your customers is dangerous and counterproductive for your business.

Food,4.5,OR,"I could go on about the positive experience my husband and I had here. We wanted to just get lost on the motorcycle and ride. We stopped and I searched ""wineries near me"" in yelp and we realized we passed Monroeville winery. We did turn around and we were sad there wasn't more advertisement or signs. We went inside and were instantly greeted by kind and polite staff. I think they could tell we were never there before, so they made us feel comfortable and showed us the ropes with a wine tasting. 

They were very knowledgeable with the wine and made great suggestions. We left with 5 bottles and great stories. My husband is a marine veteran and we were sharing stories about the woman's son who is also in the military. We connected with them on a level that they even recognized us when we seen them at the West Deptford Wine Down festival last weekend. We bought another 2 bottles at the festival and recommended them to many friends we seen there. We will be returning here for sure, but next time more prepared with friends and food! 

I almost forgot to review the actual WINE!!!! It was delicious!!! The Apple, cranberry, and one of the reds (customer favorite) were my absolute favorites. The dry wines were good too! I'm sad I didn't know about them sooner!!! 

My only advice would be better signs at the road to attract more customers."
Food,5.0,CG,"This relatively new coffee shop, has the best coffee in Nashville. 

The staff is always so friendly and the coffee is always delicious. The staff is always so nice and polite. 

The only thing I wish they would improve was the service. I ordered a double espresso and a double espresso with soy milk. I got the double espresso with soy milk and it was very good. It had a very strong almond flavor and tasted like watered down milk. I prefer soy milk and I prefer almond milk. The coffee is very strong, which is why I never feel the need to drink it again. 

Overall, it's a great place to meet up with a friend or just hang out. I would recommend it if you're in the area and want a good cup of coffee. 

The decor is nice, but I would prefer to sit inside and enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of tea.What a fantastic idea! We came in for a wine tasting and got to try some of their beers.

I got the chocolate chunk and the vanilla bean. The ice cream was really good and I liked that the flavors were a little too sweet. They also offer a wide variety of toppings. I also liked the fact that they had free samples and we could sample any flavor before deciding on the one we wanted. I will definitely be back!This place is pretty awesome!

Food,4.0,OR,"The Growler stations has me coming back again and again, I just cannot get enough of that fresh craft beer. I drive past this place on my way home from work and the thought of putting a big growler of some delicious beer in my fridge is irresistible! 

The rest of the store is huge! They have a cigar humidor and all the new flavors and special additions of various liquors. They have a huge wine selection, and overall the new store is flat out spectacular. 

They staff has all been friendly, and Kirk at the growler station a couple weeks back deserve huge brownie points for putting up with all my questions.

They have a beer tasting from 6-8 on Jan 23rd, and I plan to check that out only if my potential plans to see then Lightning shoot some puck fall apart. I think it costs $10 but you should double check that.

The two complaints I have are...and understand it is outside the stores control...but (1) we need bigger growlers, I guess we have to write our state legislators about that one, but come on, let ABC sell big growlers, and (2) why did ABC have to sell out of the Porch Peach Lounger! It was such a good craft brew. Maybe they need more than 12 choices, but nevertheless they have a great selection and very helpful twitter updates.

I love the new store and the growler station and I will keep coming back!"
Food,4.0,OR,"You first walk in and greeted with a ""hello welcome to Yogurt Beach"" with a friendly smile.  Then you head over to the array of yogurt flavors.  The young employees greet you with a sample of any of the flavors of yogurt or sometimes answer any nutritional questions you may have about the yogurt.  I almsot forgot to mention the variety of toppings they cover.  From fresh fruit (I'm certain its fresh) to candy pieces and several hard toppings like caramel hot fudge. I play safe with a light topping of chocolate sauce.  my favorite flavors so far has been red velvet.  Your serving is according to weight.  I like the fact they have a regular punch card, but makes it more tempting to keep coming back.  Since I'm on a diet, i'm gonna have to make my trips to YB as a treat then a regular. Anyways, I also wanted to comment on the ambiance. The tables are replicas of surf boards. Most the tables have tall standing chairs. I did notice at least two lower standing tables with several chairs. I'm not keen on sitting on the higher level tables so i get fro-yo and sit at the lower table.  I like the quality of the establishment. The front door has a sign ""family owned and operated"". the employees are friendly and make everyone that comes thru the door feel like their at home."

They have a few flavors to choose from, and some of them are some of the best I've ever had. I haven't tried the ice cream, but I've heard great things about it. I've tried some of the other flavors, and all of them are delicious. The prices are comparable to other ice cream shops. You can't beat the quality, and I usually end up with more than enough. I've also been in there a couple times. They have a ton of different flavors to choose from. I've also tried the peanut butter fudge, and it was really good! I also love that they have a good variety of flavors. I love the location and the people that work there. I've had some great experiences there, but they seem to be getting more and more business.

I recommend the salted caramel and the pistachio ice cream. I love their ice cream. I would highly recommend the caramel. You won't regret it!I was just in town visiting from out of town and this place was recommended by a friend. I'm glad I stopped in and I was pleasantly surprised to find it. I went in to the counter to ask for a sample of the strawberry lemonade and the clerk suggested a cookie with caramel syrup. I wasn't sure what to order but I was not disappointed!

Food,4.5,OR,"4.5 stars. I love Ices! I recall the first time I was ever invited to come here, my initial confusion at my friend's invitation. You want to go to where??? ISIS?!?!? Somehow that joke never gets old as I introduce friends to this place who have never heard of it before and they mishear it the same way.

Ices sets itself apart by using liquid nitrogen in its ice cream making process, which they claim produces a much more creamy and smoothly textured product. Although I can't vouch for the science behind their claims, I feel that whatever it is that's going on indeed produces an exquisitely creamy and delicate dessert. You also can't go wrong with any of their flavors but my favorites have to be thin mint (when they have it) and cookies and cream. Their campfire s'mores flavor is crazy too because they put some actual smoke in the dish and then cover it up for you to enjoy the smoky effect. It turns out really cool and amazing but honestly the smoke flavor gets a little overwhelming after a while.

So if you haven't tried this place yet, definitely come! In terms of taste alone it's probably my favorite in STL. The -.5 star comes from its price, which I think is slightly above what it should be. But they do give you a good amount of ice cream in each serving and I suppose you are paying a premium for the liquid nitrogen."
Food,4.0,OR,"Friends brought us here to check out the building and ambience. Sure, the outside is lit up with lights and the trees with lights give you the Christmas feeling even though it was 1-20-17 when we visited. 

Inside there is a bar upon entry and you can take a look at the menu which is straight in front of you as you walk in. Chalkboard style like 98% of other breweries are doing. 

I had the IPA which was decent. We had one and moved on. Somehow it went from quiet little quaint place to loud and uber hipster in under an hour. 

There is a sailboat hanging from the ceiling upstairs. There are tables and chairs including a couch upstairs. There are tables on the main floor and outside there are lots of chairs. Enjoy the fire which will keep you warm on those cool FL nights. 

Prices were decent. Beer was decent. Ambience of the building was decent. If you dislike hipster loud patrons don't go on a Friday at 8 PM. 

We probably would not return. There was nothing mind-blowing about their beer. Don't get me wrong, the beer was decent, but with the amount of breweries out there we can't justify returning when there are so many we have left to try. 

I believe people talk most about the building. At least that is what our group was talking about. That is what turned them on to this place to begin with."

The beer was a bit on the bitter side, but I didn't have to wait long to get my growler filled. I liked the fact that it was not just a beer, but it was a brewery. I was hoping it would be a great place to get a growler of something new and to try something new. It was a nice surprise to see how it was made. I wish they had more options for growler fills, but I will definitely be back.My friend and I went to this location during my recent trip to Nashville, and were not disappointed.

Food,4.5,OR,"Hmm.  I'm a bit late in my review, went a few months ago so perhaps things have changed but I have very mixed feelings on this place.  Starting with the good.  The bar is laid out nicely for the building they are re-purposing and there is a nice deck.  The bartender we had was friendly and gave us good service.  Beer was ok.

Now to the not so good.  We met someone on our way in that I believe was the owner and/or manager.  I give him credit for saying hi initially and trying to make us feel welcome but after that he came in and was acting a bit odd.  Was drinking quite a bit.  I'll leave it at that.

Second, the food truck left right when we got there, it was early, and we were starving.  I'm not that surprised because there was a light crowd, but it was disappointing.  They had a few things at bar but they had much to be desired.  We ended up getting some nachos with microwaved nacho cheese.  Not that we're health nuts but I think they could do better than what they offered.  Get some precut meats and cheeses possibly?  Perhaps you can get someone to pre-make some simple sandwiches and throw a handful of chips with it?

We may try again for a drink after we've already have had dinner and see how things have progressed."
Food,4.5,OR,"Took me forever to write this review but Cigar City was my favorite brewery I have been to. I flew in to Florida from Chicago for a wedding and made it a priority to stop here when I had some free time. 

This place was doppppe! I was surprised that it was a lot smaller than I expected. First thing I noticed was that they don't serve food...but have different food trucks roll in instead. Great idea since you get a variety. The inside of this place was really nice. There was a small gift shop where I grabbed some new glassware as well as some bombers to go. I grabbed some Sugar Plum which ended up being a great beer. 

I hit up the bar shortly after and did a flight. I tried 4 different beers but the one that stuck out the most was a one off beer they made. It was a red velvet stout. I don't remember the exact name of the beer but holy crap, it was delicious. It basically tasted like you were drinking cake haha, the mouth feel was also a little thicker than normal stouts which added a lot to the experience drinking it. Good stuff. 

If you're in to craft beer you NEED to go to Cigar City. It would be like going to Chicago and not visiting Goose Island. I didn't do the brewery tour and I regret it. If you have time do the tour as well!"

Helena Bakery is also located inside of it which is a huge perk since most of the other places around don't serve food.  We got a table and after looking at their tasting options decided to just grab a glass of wine instead.  

The service was extremely slow, I went up to the bar to order and they were busy, so I didn't expect fast service but it took them forever to even acknowledge me.  When one of the bartenders finally came over I ordered the Fess Parker Rose.  He asked it I wanted it sparkling or dry and I opted for sparkling.  It was definitely a good rose but it was $18 for a glass!  That threw me off a little, on the menu they had 2 roses, one was $10 and one was $12, I guess since I asked for sparkling it was way more expensive.  If I would have known I would have just gotten the dry one.  My friend got a Riesling and she liked it, nothing special but a good wine for sure.

The only reason I'd come back here is because they have the food, otherwise I'd rather go somewhere where the service is better and the prices are more within the $10/glass range."
Food,4.5,OR,"I love to see places serving AZ wine. I stopped in with my family on Black Friday, and there was a decent amount of people in, but the atmosphere still felt warm and intimate. We had no problem finding a table to accommodate our group of five. They can definitely handle a large group, but this would make a good date night spot, too. There were two or three staffers, and the one lady who worked with us was very nice and welcoming. They have 10-15 wines available (white and red, and one rose) and five beers on tap, as well as some nonalcoholic drinks in a cooler. You can also purchase light snacks like cheese and crackers or popcorn. A couple tables were using services like DoorDash or Postmates for food delivery, which is a good idea.

Wines can be ordered by the glass or bottle ($3 corking fee), or choose a tasting of five wines for $12. We shared a bottle of Zarpara Sangiovese, and my dad tried the blind tasting they had. It was a cool idea; try three wines and guess the varietals. He said one tasted like it may have been open too long. I enjoyed the Sangio, and they had an okay variety from different wineries. I would've liked to see more Northern AZ wineries featured. I only saw a red from Page Springs. I would love to see something from Burning Tree or Javelina Leap up north.

Hands down the best ice cream around. We stopped by on a whim and the ice cream was so good. It was good, but not worth the price. The small was $3. 75 for a medium. It was $4. 75 for a medium.

We had the opportunity to meet up with the owners, and the owner was very friendly and helpful. We ended up getting a free scoop of their Butter Cake and Chocolate Chip. The Butter Cake and Chocolate Chip were excellent, and the Chocolate Chip had a lot of flavor to them. We will definitely be back.Came here for the first time today. The prices are very reasonable. The store is very clean and organized. The staff was very nice and helpful. I was able to find a specific item I needed. I ended up getting a bottle of some great wine to take home. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other products.There's a reason for this place. My parents have been coming here for years. I was going to buy groceries in the store and when I saw that the prices were posted on the wall of the store, I thought that was a good idea.

Food,3.0,OR,"Mine is about the same as Matthews below. I received a nasty email from the company though two days after I placed the order and was full of lies. 1st lie - they stated that the groupon clearly stated it wasnt good until after Feb 14th - Called groupon and they said that is not the case and they will also contact Fancy Fortune Cookies about this, I have also a screen shot from the screen when purchasing the groupon that said it is good the day after purchase. 2nd lie - They stated that their website ""clearly"" showed the cookies being out of stock - I also have printed screen shots of ALL of the screens when placing my order and not one says anything about being out of stock or any warning that my order would not arrive the next day. (I paid $29. 00 in shipping for next day). Also, the only place on the website I could find anything about being out of stock was if I clicked 1 of the at least 50 links on their page. I have left 2 messages and sent 2 email (chat's) since Friday 2/10 and only have recieved a mass communications email that was rude and inaccurate. -Like Matthew said below Save your time & money.

Food,2.5,OR,"While I am not generally the type of person to ""Go Ham"" over a grocery chain, I am totes in love with this newly renovated Acme (used to be Super Fresh). While part of my reasoning may be in part biased slash based by default on exceptionally negative experiences (i. e. the stupid amount of money I've been forced to spend over the years and become accustomed to as the ""norm"" at Rittenhouse Market), I have to say that this place is a total 180 from the former Super Fresh. For city living, this has got to be the closest I've ever come to suburban grocery prices. Produce is fresh and they have a beautiful flower selection that can go toe-to-toe with Whole Foods 95% of the time. Great weekly specials and deals and, as a nerdy HR professional, I have to wonder what kind of staff training they put their people through, because the level of customer service and simply ""smiling"" cashiers is a pleasant shock in comparison to the disgruntled staff from Super Fresh days. Living only a few blocks away, I frequent this location almost daily. Also, a lesser known tip for people in the area:  if you have guests coming from out of town and struggle on advising them where to park, the Acme garage is only $10 for the day (and I think $18 overnight) if you buy $10 worth of groceries in the store."

The flavors are different from the typical ice cream shop ice cream flavors, but they do have unique flavors that I have never heard of before. They also have homemade coffee drinks which are delicious. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I love the concept of this place. They have a ton of flavors and toppings to choose from. There is a lot of seating for people to enjoy. I wish they had more options for ice cream as I haven't tried any of the other flavors. They also have a pretty wide variety of toppings to choose from.

Food,4.5,OR,"This place is super adorable!  Our friend who's a fishtown resident brought us to her ""favorite little ice cream place"" when we were visiting for the day in July 2017.  It was hot and we wanted a refreshing treat.  

The ice cream sandwich reputation proceeds them - and I was stoked to see what the flavors for that day were.  As I'm writing this, I'm having the hardest time remembering WHY I didn't actually order a sandwich!  The flavors that day were a lemon verbena blackberry on a sugar cookies, a blueberry on cardamom grahams, and the black & white which was chocolate and vanilla ice cream with chocolate chip cookies.  For some reason, (brain damage being the only plausible reason) I opted for a single scoop.  

There was a flavor called, the Ramble tamble which was chocolate ice cream with salted caramel and buckwheat graham cracker crumble, served delightfully in a homemade waffle cone.  I remember this vividly, and it was perfection.  The buckwheat graham cracker was amazing - a nice crunch with a slight edge of saltiness without taking away from the chocolate and salted caramel tango. Maybe it wasn't brain damage...I must have just wanted chocolate.

Regardless, I'm so excited to go back and try one of their cookie sandwiches!  The women working behind the counter were super friendly and helpful - plus they let us taste everything too!  A definite stop if you're in the fishtown area!"

We waited about 5 minutes for our drinks and then the lady who took our order was so rude and rude. It was clear she didn't want to be there. I ordered a double espresso and a double espresso with soy milk and it was horrible. I didn't realize how bad the drinks were. It was so bad that I had to go to Starbucks and get another one. I don't understand why this is how the staff treated me. I'm not sure why she is here anymore. She was rude and rude. She was talking to me and not giving me my coffee for free. I understand this isn't a place to go for coffee but I didn't like how it tasted. My partner also ordered a birthday cake from here and was told she would have to wait for him to come over and order the cake. She didn't say anything. She was very rude and nasty. She didn't even know what we wanted to order. I felt bad for her and would never go back to this location.

It's a shame because I am not sure if they have a good selection of alcohol, but if I am in the area, I will definitely come back. I think I'll probably stick with their wine club. I have been going here for over 10 years and it is the best location ever. The staff is always friendly and the ice cream is excellent.

Food,4.5,OR,"My first visit to Coppertail was during a brew hub tour on a Sunday afternoon.  I was only there for an hour, but loved all of the beers that I sampled.  My husband and I were able to get a seat at the bar, along with 5 others from the tour.  The location is easy to find on a corner near IKEA.  The interior is spacious and a bit of the farmhouse industrial style with wood and steel accents.

The last time I visited Tampa, Coppertail was a must visit again.  This time my husband and I visited on a Wednesday afternoon and got seats at the bar.  When we arrived it wasn't too busy, but a few hours later and it was packed out.  The one flaw that I saw was regarding the time it takes to get a beer when it's busier.  The issues are these: they could use more staff behind the bar during the ""happy hour"" (there was 1.5 while we were there.  The .5 is because one was hanging out on the other side of the bar for the majority of the time), a set place to approach the bar to order a drink (if you weren't sitting at the bar), or staff to take orders from those sitting at tables throughout the bar.

Overall though, this is my favorite brewery location to visit in the Tampa area and would highly recommend a visit there if you are in the area."
Food,4.0,OR,"BEST FROYO. AHHH! and ppl will yell at me for this, but i like it over pinkberry and even red mango. 

to date, i gave this honor to tutti frutti in the city, but this place blows all other froyo in philly away. i tried the blood orange, raspberry, chocolate sorbet, and peanut butter and they were all delicious. the bf had original, vanilla as well and he was also delivering praise in spades.  

my favorite combination was the blood orange with strawberries, blueberries, green tea mochi with a teensy corner of chocolate crunchy awesomesauce (yeah, that is what they actually call it). the other half of my cup had snickers, reese's peanut butter cups, and cookie dough with chocolate sorbet and it was also quite delicious. 

aside from the huge range of froyos available, the toppings bar is ridiculous. they have a ridiculous selection of 'awesomesauces' which consist of candy or nuts in a chocolate-y or creamy base, chopped fruits, nuts, all the candy selections you can think of, mochi AND green tea mochi (i've never seen this anywhere else), and more things i can't even recall with my feeble brain. just know, whatever you want, they have it. 

the only thing you have to fear is if you are an indecisive person. because there are soooo many froyo flavors (8-10?) and sooooooooo many toppings (like 30?!) that choosing will be difficult. then again, since the cups are so huge, you could  theoretically just get everything and taste it all."

I was told that I would have to wait another hour to get my refund. I was very disappointed. I was told to call customer service to make sure the manager would get the refund.

There's a lot of organic/vegan options here. This is not a market I go to often because it's closer to my home. 

The produce is the best around, and the prices are great. They have a lot of local products and some organic items that are cheaper elsewhere.

Food,4.5,OR,"I did this tour when I was probably 10 or 11 years old.  The only thing I remember was the Clydesdales of course.  But in all the times as an adult coming back through St Louis, I hadn't gotten back over here.  And my wife had never seen a large scale brewery before, only micro-brews.  So we made it a point to come.

Suffice to say, it's free (bonus) but I would have happily paid for this tour.  it's over an hour long, walking tour down hill and then a trolley takes you back up for your tasting.  The tasting were two FULL SIZE glasses of beers on tap, and some in bottles.  Also their new Lime-rita (eew) in a can.  

We had a blast, actually learned a ton, and the gift shop were normal prices.  But they have a build-your-own 6-pack area so you can mix and match some of the brews you liked, or didn't get to taste.  Fun!  We picked that up with some tasting glasses for fun later in the week at home.  

The only (slight) complaint is how scripted the tour guides were.  But they run tours every 15 minutes.  I can only imagine.  But the girl kept forgetting her 'lines' which made me cringe a bit.

Here's why: I've only ever been able to find my fave Lypsyl chapstick here; a small parking lot out front means I can pick up my meds on the way home from work instead of having to go home first and then walk there; the scale of the store is much smaller in both store size and number of customers so I'm not overwhelmed and there is hardly ever a line; and the staff is helpful and nice (one time a female worker even came up to me while I was struggling to be bold and pick out the perfect red lipstick to join the ranks of Gwen Stefani and the rest of the cool girls and conspiratorially leaned in and let me know their beauty guarantee is for real--just bring it back with the receipt and get a refund*). 

CVS ExtraCare Bucks, coupons, and Beauty Guarantee are worth mentioning even if they apply to every CVS because they're still pretty cool.

I think the Thai tea is one of the best tea I've ever had. The raspberry shortcake was perfect and not too sweet. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a sweet treat. I would definitely come back and try more of their teas. They also have a lot of great baked goods. This is a must-see if you're in the area. I've never been to a Starbucks before and was a bit skeptical about the coffee from this location. I decided to try this place and was not disappointed. I was greeted by a friendly staff member.

The place is cute, and the owner is very nice. He has great recommendations for drinks and will make recommendations based on what you're looking for.

The only thing that I'd suggest is to bring your own bags, as they can't accept credit cards!

Food,4.0,OR,"I like Trader Joe's and go to this one more than others.  The biggest downside is the parking area which can be really crowded.  Also when you are leaving the parking lot, if you want to turn left to go north, traffic can be very heavy and moves quickly.  Inside the parking lot, it isn't set up very well as there can be 3 cars coming together from different directions and things can get clogged.  Once you get past the parking challenge, however, the store is very nice.  The selection isn't huge but you can find some things you won't find in other stores.  I have found that the Trader Joe's brand items are particularly good.  Some of my favorite things at the store are the ready-made salads, Trader Joe's ice cream-especially pumpkin, the soups-love the carrot ginger, tomato red pepper in particular, and some of the frozen items.  The produce appears to be fresh.  There are usually samples of drinks and food offered which is a fun way to get to know some of the things available.   They have a lot of natural items-things with less or no preservatives.  I usually go for some specific things that I like but often find something new that I  come to like a lot as well and many seasonable items.  I also like the flowers and plants.

The line was out the door and the tiny parking lot was full but there was free street parking.

I knew the line would move fast and was worth it so no worries there. Plus, I could see the menu sign through the window and it's a tough choice -- they have a lot of delicious sounding flavors.

Could have chosen 90% of the options but went with two double scoop containers to go -- peanut butter chip, chocolate chip, dark chocolate paso brittle and churro con leche. 

The woman waiting on me was super friendly and helpful. Since I got it to go, she gave me extra cups to serve the scoops.

They also have frozen yogurt but since that's everywhere in SoCal, I went for the good stuff. They also offer toppings but the ice cream is rich and loaded with ingredients so I don't see the reason for toppings.

They have tons of celebrity photos including several Presidents going back to Eisenhower and JFK. It's been there since 1949 (the year after In-N-Out first opened). 

Took the ice cream back to my hotel room. My favorite two were the peanut butter and churro options. My wife liked the chocolate chip. Young daughter just ate what was in front of her, it was all over her face and she seemed happy.

A big crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Personally I think $2 for a bagel is pricey, but they seem busy enough so I guess people are willing to pay the price.  

We went at 8am on a Saturday and they were so busy the line was out the door.  But the line moved fast.  My daughter and I got a sesame bagel with lox cream cheese ($4), an everything bagel ($2) and a coffee ($2).  They even gave my little one a mini bagel on the house (note they do not sell mini bagels but I think it was just what they do with little bits of extra dough).  

We brought our goodies home and it was so good. We took a little of the spread from the sesame bagel and put it on the mini. It was perfect for breakfast.  The everything is waiting to be eaten but I hear it calling our names.... The coffee was also good.

The space is small...no space to eat inside so it's take out only. But you can watch them making the bagels so there is some fun while you wait.  Employees were friendly!

I've also had issues with the pharmacy. I've had issues with one of the pharmacy techs, who's always on the phone with a hard time deciding on what to do to get my meds filled. I've never been able to get the meds filled and it's always a long wait. They never have it ready. I'm not sure if they're going to do this to me or to them, but I've never had an issue with any of the staff.

It's also not the best place to shop.

Then I picked up some cute St.Patrick's day cards for my pen pals. I love their stationary selection for all the holidays and special occasions. I buy almost all of my cards here.

Finally, it was time to hit the Easter aisle. I was in desperate need of those cadbury mini eggs. I don't know about you but I hoard these to have during the off season and ever since my stash ran out I've been dying for it to be Easter again. The first week of March turned out to be the perfect time for Easter candy to appear! It was my lucky day. Two bags of those and a carton of Russell Stover's milk chocolate marshmallow eggs then I was ready to check out. 

They make this so easy with plenty of cashiers and they actually like when you use your reusable bags. Yes, I am one of those nuts. I hate plastic bags. Not many stores make it as convenient to use your reusable bags and Target even rewards me for them by gifting me .5cents a bag. It's not much but it is a nice pat on the back for working towards being more environmental friendly. Target gets an A+ for this visit."

Snowrolls is great for young kids. They have a shelf to the left of the entrance that has games, Snowrolls coloring sheets and crayons and even a model car that my soon to be two year old would not put down during our entire visit.

So with all this good, why only three stars? While Snowrolls is good at what they do, their rolled ice cream style isn't something I would seek out on a regular basis. I prefer the creamy, hand dipped ice cream style. My daughter seems to have this same reaction as she only ate one bite of her ice cream during our last visit. Snowrolls is also pretty expensive compared to other vegan ice cream options in the area.

All in all, Snowrolls seems good at what they do and I'm excited they brought their rolled ice cream to New Tampa. You just won't find me going out of my way to eat their style of ice cream."

The shop is adorable and so cute. The staff was super friendly and the shop was so cute. The shop is small and quaint. It's a perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. I would recommend stopping by if you're in the area.I love this place! I came here to do a quick dessert and I have a hard time deciding on what to get since I don't have a lot of options. They also have a great selection of other dessert options. I got a chocolate truffle ice cream with cream and cookie dough. It was delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone.I went here to pick up a gift for my family. We ended up leaving empty handed. I have no idea how long this business has been around and they have no clue how to handle the pandemic. It is very disorganized. I was expecting more of a lot more and more. I was very disappointed with the service. The cashier was very rude and didn't even smile or even greet us. They only gave me with a hello when we asked what I was in a question. When we were leaving. I got a look at the register"
Food,3.5,OR,"Subzero gets 5 stars for unique presentation -- it's like going to a hibachi grill for ice cream! It's a fun experience watching your ice cream go from liquid base to frozen treat right before your eyes. If you don't enjoy the big WHOOOSH of liquid nitrogen filling the air, then well, you just don't know how to have fun.

I also give 5 stars for dietary options. I eat everything, obviously, but I see how it'd be harder to find tasty frozen goodies if you were vegan, lactose intolerant, paleo, dieting, whatever. This place offers soy and almond milks, in addition to low fat milk, yogurt, custard, etc., which is nice for peeps with dietary restrictions.

That being said, if you're one who eats everything and wants to maximize flavor, I recommend you get the custard or premium ice cream base instead of being all virtuous and getting some low fat nonsense. Also get mix-ins that spread well, like chocolate sauce, strawberries, etc. Read the other reviews that talk about blandness, and you'll get where I'm going with this.

I still recommend you check this place out at least once, just because the process is fun, and it's something different from normal self-serve fro yo. Be prepared for a wait during busy times (i.e. summer in general). It takes a sec to measure out the goodies and do the whole freezy routine for each customer, so the line moves slowly. Luckily, the woman who I assume is the owner is adorable and chatty, so she'll make you feel right at home."
Food,3.5,CG,"This review isn't about the ice cream, the ice cream itself. The ice cream is a little too sweet for my liking. The ice cream is not great, it's just not worth it. I came here for the first time today and had the first time a couple of times. I ordered the waffle cone and it was a little over-sweet for my liking. The waffle cone was good. It was $4. 50 for a small cone. I would probably order the waffle cone again, but I was disappointed. I was a little disappointed by the ice cream itself. It was a little too sweet for my liking. I would have given this place a 5 if I could. It was a bit pricey for a cone, but it was worth it. I'd probably choose another ice cream place in the area. My friend and I went to this location during a recent trip to Nashville. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only thing I didn't like was that the service was slow. The drinks were very slow, which was a bit slow, the place was packed, but not very crowded. I would go back to this location again. I'm not my first time to this location."
Food,4.0,OR,"It's very rare to find a liquor store with both a huge selection and great prices. If you've spent time in Southern California, Corkdorks has a similar selection to BevMo! but with better prices. They have an incredible selection of beer, wine, and liquor, so there is something for everyone. 

I consistently find my favorite California and Oregon wines for prices that are either lower than or equal to what I paid in-state for them. They also have some unusual, hard-to-find wines and beers. I'm from the Willamette Valley and I have frequently come across older Oregon pinots that are nearly impossible to find outside of Oregon wine country.

In addition to the already good prices, Corkdorks regularly has sales on certain sizes of different liquors. I recently bought a handle (1.75L) of Bombay Sapphire for less than $10 more than the regular sized fifth (.75L). I also look out for sales on some of my go-to wines.

The customer service at Corkdorks is top-notch. Whenever I'm looking for a specific wine, an employee approaches me within minutes and immediately finds it, which is quite impressive given the size of the store's selection. The employees are super helpful and love talking about the products. If you like to be left alone or are just looking, it might feel like they are hounding you. However, they are genuinely just trying to be helpful. If you already know what you want, they have a great online ordering feature and will even bring everything out to your car when you arrive to pick it up."

Food,4.5,OR,"Three stars to Bacchanal for an awesome environment: a little out of the way (though in close proximity to a Blue Bike station right off the river walk), but once you've arrived, you're in the most relaxed backyard with a great energy. The simple strung Christmas lights look super pretty, and the semi-random mix of tables and chairs makes everything very cozy. They have jazz every day, and even if you arrive while the artists are taking a break, you can relax on the patio and maybe even read a book while you wait for the music to resume.

No stars to Bacchanal from me for drinks, but I'm not a wine drinker, so what do you expect? That's not really Bacchanal's fault! They had exactly one cider option (which was really more of a wine blend). I had two cocktails from the bar upstairs and while they tasted good, neither was particularly strong.

One star to Bacchanal for a great system for cheese boards. I've never experienced this before but it's my new favorite thing: choose your own cheeses from the cooler (you decide the type and size, which ultimately informs the price), take them to the cashier, and they plate them for you and provide accoutrements (which does come along with an additional fee, which may have been a little on the pricy side, but ultimately it was worth it). 

Total: four well deserved stars! We would definitely come back here, but based on our own preferences, we wouldn't be drinking. It would be all about the environment and the music!"
Food,4.0,OR,"One of my law school graduation gifts was a $200 Total Wine gift card. I honestly don't know what was more exciting-- graduating or having a shopping spree at Total Wine.

I decided I wanted to use my gift card to stock my home bar with the basics--tequila, vodka, gin, rum, and some liqueurs. I don't often buy liquor, so I decided to go with brands I knew-- Kettle One, Bombay Sapphire, etc.

One of the Total Wine folks on the floor asked me if I needed any help. I told him my mission was stocking my home bar. He then recommended some brands that he thought were better than the ones I picked out, not to mention cheaper. He took time to show me where his recommendations were and why he liked them. Not only was it great that he was super helpful, but how often do you go shopping and the sales person actually helps you to try and save money?

Thanks to his recommendations, I had plenty left over to also grab several bottles of wine, and peruse the craft beer aisle for some single servings I had been wanting to try.

The store itself has a great selection, and is a pretty good size. Also, I went to this location a second time, and the customer service was great again. My only wish is that they would display the Arizona wines more prominently, especially considering Tucson's proximity to the Southern Arizona winemakers. They are tucked in the last row towards the back of the store, where they are literally gathering dust."

Food,3.5,OR,"I have lived in this area and shopped at this Publix for about 6 months now so feel I know the store pretty well. Chain grocery are all about the same. Similar organization and aisles. So, I'll just talk about what works for me and what doesn't. 

Deli-wish the sushi guy would wear his mask over his nose. There is a woman in the deli who helps get deli meats. She is super nice and cute the right thickness and puts in in the bag neatly-important for someone who's picky about these things. Thank you! 

Produce-there is a gentleman who manages produce that is so kind and helpful-and he knows his products. He has recommended produce to me and they have always been perfect! These are the touches that make me enjoy a trip to a store! 

Meat-The meat department seems smaller than most stores I've shopped. They don't have a lot of selection. However, most of the meat we have had is really good. 

Aisles-They do a good job keeping things stocked. I have been told that they will order things if you ask.  

Bakery-I've liked the things I've tried. They make good rye bread and pastries. Not fond of the baguettes as they are very soft and airy. 

Beer, Wine & Spirits- They have a good selection of all and more at Publix Liquors next door.

Food,4.0,OR,"Having been here repeatedly for lunch with a couple of friends who were working in the area along with me, I felt that it was time to re-review this Wegmans, specifically for the food bar this time.

Wegmans' food bars are always a thing of awesomeness. They have a ridiculous spread of fresh, good tasting food, and the prices, while on the higher end, are certainly justified by the quality (in my mind, at least).

My personal favorites are the veggie egg rolls, the soups, and the roasted veggies. In particular, they have a seasoned yellow rice, which, when paired with the roasted veggies, makes for a match made in heaven. Really.

Beyond that, the sushi bar is very nice, with handmade rolls being churned out right in front of you. And if you want a slightly customized roll, just go ahead and ask. So long as it isn't too wacky (I may or may not have tried asking for a french fry and mozz. stick roll - hint: they'll say no), they'll do their best to comply, such as with a spicy veggie roll, which is really really good.

As always, be sure to time your visits carefully, since the lunch rush inundates this place with all the local office folk, but even as such, it's definitely worth coming by. One nice thing - they have an extensive beer selection for anyone who's into that thing, although I've heard that the pricing may not be all that awesome. Regardless, it's nice to have the option!

TLDR: Great place, good food, wide variety, pricey (but worth it)"

I like that they have a separate section for your donut holes, which is great for those who want to try different flavors!

Overall, it's a great place to shop for a donut. I'm glad I stopped by and I'd recommend it to everyone. I hope they get to the point where I can order a dozen, and have them shipped to me.This place is amazing!! They have great flavors, and they have a very nice selection of toppings!

Food,4.5,OR,"I have been to various Trader Joe's in the US from my years living in Boston, SF Bay area, and Philly metro area.  

As far as Trader Joe's locations go, this is a pretty run of the mill one.   It is clean, neat, and generally well-stocked as you would expect any Trader Joe's.  Selection is pretty good but not quite as varied or as large as some of the bigger locations I have been.   

The aisles are a little smaller than some of the others Trader Joe's I have been to which makes getting around a bit tricky when it gets really crowded.  

What I find most difficult is how many people linger in the aisles (it really doesn't make a difference what can of soup you get) forever but this is just a Midwest/St. Louis thing I still have to get used to.  In Boston, they would run you down without mercy. 

If you are cooking from scratch and need fresh ingredients, I would still recommend going to Whole Foods nearby instead especially if you need an ingredient or two off the beaten path or want a wider choice of fresh seafood.   

As others have mentioned too, the Promenade is just a horribly designed parking lot that is kind of weirdly sloped and seemingly has people going every which way.   

Work of advice: Don't take small kids here unless you can go at off-hours during the week and avoid it during the weekend afternoons because it does get pretty crowded."

I was with a friend and we were going out to lunch and she started talking about how good the food was here, raving about the French fries.   When you go in, you order at the counter and if you get food, you will pick it up at the container window (don't worry, they'll tell you where to go).  I did tell them what type of beer that I like and they steered me to one that was like it.

She ordered a repeat of what she had had the other day which was the chicken sandwich.  I ordered a double hamburger (I was hungry).  Your condiments are at the window where you get your food.  We both had French fries with our orders.  The French fries are what you would call shoestring fries and I'll have to admit, they were delicious.  My hamburger was delicious also and more than enough since I ordered a double.  Her chicken sandwich looked so good that I have decided that I will order that the next time I come here.

The seating is all shaded, and most of it is comfortable.  There's also some relatively new, decent, shared seating with longer tables inside the building, near Stella Java/Sonora SnoCones.  Seating inside was much needed for a long time, so it's good to see that it has been added!

The shops inside of the Mercado are locally owned and they make fantastic products.  You can get everything from breakfast burritos to lunch to fancy dinner to dessert to coffee here, and all at different shops!  It's awesome!  There's also some shops to buy knick knacks, furniture, and decorations.  Most stuff is more rustic in style, which is not for me, but I still love walking through the shops.

This location is easy to access from many avenues. 
The associated are friendly, however I watched many that were not busy and standing around as people shopped. At this particular time there was an elderly woman approaching, well trying to approach the checkout lanes in a motorized cart that was badly in need of a recharge to its batteries..
It was quite obvious she was in need of assistance as this woman was using her foot to propel the dying vehicle.  
I was in the middle of my transaction in a lane being hurried along to swipe my card as I saw this poor woman in distress. 
No associate made any attempt to come to this womans aid. 
Unfortunately this is not the only public place where I have witnessed such utter disregard to help someone in need. 
Shame on those who are there with pretend smiles collecting a paycheck at the end of each week. 
As far as the stores' overall appearance and product choices?  HORRIBLE
The shelves had many holes where products should have been. Not just a few things. The store was out of so many things. 
I can see instance where the store has been shopped hard and restocking hasnt been done, or a few items on sale are now out of stock. But this was an abundance of items that were just out of stock.

The owner was awesome.  She was very, humble, helpful, and friendly. She told me about the shops future plans, which included smoothies (probably October) and a veggie bar.

I highly recommend getting here early because they do not have an infinite supply of daily fresh fruit and have been known to run out of some of the popular fruits before closing time.

Food,4.0,OR,"I headed over to Caffe Luce to meet up with a friend yesterday afternoon, and I was craving for some coffee.  For someone who drinks coffee for pure enjoyment (can't take much caffeine), I like a drink that is smooth, sweet, and creamy.  And anything beyond that is a bonus.  So, I ordered a decaf white mocha with soy...it was absolutely delicious.  Not only that, it looked beautiful.  The barista actually poured the soy milk in strategically, creating a very organic, leaf-like pattern at the top of my drink.  I said, ""Thanks for making this beautiful!"" and he replied, ""I try my best to not make it ugly.""  Well, he's doing a darn good job, I'd say.  

Something great about the menu is their sizes...chain coffee shops force you to buy a drink that you may not finish, forcing you to waste coffee and pay more for it.  It's different at Caffe Luce.  They have an 8-ounce size, which is beautiful because for some reason, I can't ever finish a drink that is more than 10 ounces unless I share it with someone.  You can tell Caffe Luce takes coffee seriously because they want their patrons to have the size they want and something they'll drink to the last drop, which is precisely what I did with my decaf white mocha with soy.  

When I was there yesterday, every table inside was taken, and I was okay with it.  I'm just glad that this local business is staying busy because it certainly deserves to be."

My grandfather enjoyed it and he bought various old school brands by the handle to pour directly in his cans of diet cola on weekend afternoons. Why else would I have always laughed when I shared homeroom in middle school with a poor kid named Evan Williams.)

From the bourbon standpoint, their variety is vast while I cannot confirm or deny they have more than chain stores like Total Wine which get the majority of my business when it comes to buying spirits and wine.

It is probably unfair to compare a store like this to the larger package stores, especially on price, so I'll simply compliment Whiskey Willy's on the cleanliness and organization of the interior. Many independent stores of this size are nasty, cluttered with a vibe of an impending return to prohibition...but WW's makes a much better presentation overall.

They do lose a star from me from the attitude and knowledge of the one employee during my visit, who either did not know a basic difference between items or simply answered yes to the one in my hand to make a sale.

I'm only assuming Culver's next door won't let you walk inside and add a snort or two of the Early Times you bought at Whiskey Willy's to that fountain beverage while you enjoy one of their combo meals. However, there is always that outdoor patio if one works quickly and discreetly."
Food,4.0,CG,"I'm really disappointed in this location. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the staff is so rude. The people behind the counter are the most ignorant people you'll ever encounter. They are rude and will not help you. I wish I could give it 5 stars. I don't know how they manage to hire them.I have never had a bad experience at this location. My husband and I went to the drive thru on a Saturday afternoon around 11:30pm and it was very busy. The line was long, but moved very quickly. The coffee was good, and the service was fast. I would recommend this location to anyone.This is my favorite place to get some fro yo and to pick up a few things. I've never had an issue with any of the staff here. They are always very friendly and help out with a few questions. I love the selection of flavors they have available. I also love their smoothies, and the prices are a bit on the high side. I love the variety of toppings and they have so many different combinations of toppings. My favorite is the large dark chocolate and ginger, mint and chocolate.This place is my new to St Louis tradition! I'm never had a favorite place to go here and will go.

Food,3.5,CG,"I am sooo livid right now. The only reason I don't give this place a 4 star is because I am very close to a Starbucks and have had better experiences. The staff is nice and the drinks are great. I like the coffee shop atmosphere. This is my new favorite Starbucks.I was looking for a quick stop for a quick coffee and made a recommendation to come check this place out. It's right next to the train station. It's an adorable little shop with lots of seating. There is a couple of couches, but I'm not sure what the feel of this place is. I ordered a milk tea with bubbles, it was not as good as I expected it to be. The bubbles were a bit small for my liking, and the bubbles were not even warm. My friend ordered a sugar free tea with bubbles, which I was not impressed with. I'll go back to try the other drinks. I will definitely come back.Best ice cream in town. My wife and I got the chocolate chip cookie dough and it was so good. The staff was friendly and the ice cream was creamy. The waffle cone was creamy and creamy and delicious.This place is my new to St Louis, but I'm never had a fan.   I don't go to this place is in St Louis."
Food,4.5,OR,"Came here a while ago with a group of my friends for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday one weekend. It's a small cute little coffee shop that sells acai bowls and some bagel sandwiches. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, both are pretty limited. On Saturday, we came at a later time in the morning and the place was pretty packed, there was nowhere to sit or really wait. One of my friends got one of the acai bowls on the first day ( I apologize I don't remember which one but I believe its the most popular/basic one) and enjoyed it, though noting it has more of a strawberry base, which was unique. On the second day, we came right when it opened and ordered a large number of bagel sandwiches, primarily the works and the caprese. Since it's a small coffee shop and they only had two workers, it took a while for our order to be ready and they ran out of eggs to use in the sandwiches (that's the only reason I'm giving taking away a star). But the workers were super sweet and tried to make our orders as fast as they could, and the bagel sandwiches did taste awesome (I ordered mine on a sun-dried tomato bagel which made it fantastic). On another note, they don't have restrooms and I had to go to another restaurant to use theirs (not sure if it was allowed or not).  Overall, really liked the cafe just wish it was a bit larger to accomodate more people and allow more people to enjoy their products!"
Food,5.0,OR,"My husband surprised me with this tour for my birthday last weekend. I have always wanted to go to Santa Barbara's wine country and his idea of taking a tour was perfect. Lisa, our guide and certified sommelier, was great! She had great information and history throughout our trip. The drive was beautiful and she made it even better by pointing out sights & sharing stories. In the beginning she asked us if we knew what kind of wines we enjoyed and from there she took us to our first winery. She made sure to observe what we enjoyed and disliked and tailored the rest of our trip to our tastes. She led us to what are now our fave wines (by the way,  my husband and I have different tastes). 

We were picked up from our hotel and We went to 4 wineries. She also had us pick from a lunch menu before the trip and we enjoyed our delicious sandwiches at a picnic table at one of the wineries. She provided plenty of water and made sure to take a picture of us at every winery. Which, was great, because we kept forgetting to take pictures ourselves. 

During the tastings, she would step out and just let us enjoy ourselves. You can tell she has a good relationship with the wineries and we were able to take a behind the scenes tour through one of them. 

The ride was very very comfortable. I highly recommend this tour! They also have a wine, cheese and chocolate tour in Ventura, which we will definitely be going to someday."
Food,3.5,CG,"I love me some Tarjay! We have been going to this place since they opened up a few years ago. The staff is always friendly and the store is always clean. The only thing that is disappointing is that the produce is always gone. This is why I am not going back. They need to find some new people to make the store better. I think they need to get some new staff. This is the only place I have been to that has better customer service. I would be a regular customer. I've never been to a Dunkin Donuts before and I've been to a lot of other locations in the area. I'm not a fan of Dunkin Donuts and this location is my favorite. It's located in a convenient location on the second floor of the mall, the only one in the area is about a mile from the drive thru. The location is convenient and has the drive thru and is always pretty clean. The staff is always friendly and efficient. They have a lot of seating inside and outside if you want to sit outside. The inside is also very clean. The inside is also has a very spacious and I've never seen a Starbucks that's. The location is in a little old school and the drive thru the back on the second floor."

I have had to wait for her to come over and tell me to leave because I am not sure if she is a manager or not.  I have never felt so bad for her.  I will definitely not be coming back to this store.  The other star is for the location.  It is not great.  I am not sure why I would give this place less stars if they would have more food options.  I will go to another location.This is a very cool place with good drinks. I've been coming here since it opened and have not been disappointed. I love their smoothies, smoothies, and juices.

Food,4.0,OR,"Fun concept.  Cold night so line wrapped around inside but it moved fast.  
Party of four...I accidentally tasted everyone's.  Not a bad flavor...cookie or ice cream in the bunch.  
I thought heating the whole ice cream sandwich at the end would make a huge mess.  Wrong.  Just made the cookie taste like it was fresh out of the oven.  The cinnamon oatmeal cookie was full of flavor. Brownie soft and good (and I'm picky when it comes to brownies).  The donut was a novelty but didn't do it for me. All of the ice cream was good. 
Will definitely go back 

First visit got five stars but my return tonight doesn't make me want to come back.  Staffing was horrible.  The people aren't mean but definitely not friendly.  There was a five plus minute wait for a cashier to step up.  No cashier at all.  One of the cookie makers started to check people out as people who had not even ordered were saying we need a cashier. She checked out two people and went back to doing orders so another wait with NO cashier. Meanwhile 2/3 cookies that had been heated got cold and #3 didn't even get offered to be heated. After tonight I'm not sure I'll return. 

Returned looking for my favorite oatmeal cookie.  They said the gooey butter is a better seller and they no longer have oatmeal. Tried gooey butter.  I know it's a St. Louis thing but not for me.  Brownie not for me.  Darn...no oatmeal...I'm out."
Food,4.5,OR,"I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of ""tree huggers"" and ""earth children"", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while."

The customer service is excellent. I am from Seattle and I come to Starbucks often. I always get a great service. I also love the fact that they are always so busy. I just wish there was more seating. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because of the music. The music is really loud and not enough to keep you in a place to sit and watch. The staff is super friendly and they have a Starbucks. The location is great and the employees are always helpful. This Starbucks is always clean and well stocked. My only gripe is the parking lot is a bit of a pain. Overall, this location is a very nice location to grab a quick drink. This is the best place for a single serving of beer. They have a lot of different beers on tap and they have a large selection of beers on tap. My favorite is the Hefeweizen. They have a growler which is the IPA which is the blonde which is their wheat ale and hefeweizen. The green lager. It is the blonde."
Food,3.5,OR,"Smiths, how I wish you were ANY other supermarket.

Let me touch base on a couple things:

Pharmacy - they drive me nuts here, the technicians seem resentful of their job here.  They move slow and have a crappy attitude.  On top of that getting them to match the price from somewhere else can be a hair-pulling, time wasting experience.   Even if I have the same prescription month over month, they still try and upcharge me to whatever the most expensive cost is so I have to jump through the same hoops for them to give me the lower price.  It just gets really aggrivating.

Produce - stuff usually looks and or is, expired.   It's also horribly overpriced for the quality you are going to get.   You will get lucky and find some good items now and then but all in all, I'd tell you to go elsewhere.

Canned/Boxed foods:   This is where it get's gross.    Almost every time I purchase something here I get an item that is expired, not just a few days but in most cases MONTHS have past.   We got a jar of olives that expired 9 months prior.  NINE MONTHS.    They had the audacity to give us a hard time when we tried to return them.

A couple of positives:

Other than the pharmacy techs, staff here is friendly and helpful.

Gas is cheap, especially if you have points built up.  I love that I don't have to drive all the way to Costco for gas anymore.

Kroger - step up your game!"

Food,3.0,OR,"I paid $35 for the Whole Thing car wash at the Town & Country location of Waterway the other day. It comes with a ""redo"" coupon that you can use within 5 days, so I went to the Creve Coeur location for this second cleaning. 

The Town & Country employees did a fine job getting all the big spots, but the car was still dusty in the cup holders and on the doors, and it needed extra spot vacuuming on the carpets. It clearly was not thoroughly complete from the first go, but it was still a huge improvement from the way I had arrived, and I know the team there worked hard on it for quite a while. 

Second time, here in Creve Coeur, I was shocked at how quickly I was told the job was complete! When I went to ""inspect"" the work that they'd done, I was not delighted or amused. The car looked exactly the same way it did when I dropped it off. The doors and cup holders were still dusty, the salt on the carpet (that I had already pointed out) was not removed, and the few spots of dirt on my rugs still remain. On my first visit, I saw a huge improvement from my arrival to my departure. At Creve Coeur, there was no difference... the staff has simply rushed this through and did not pay attention to detail whatsoever. 

I am going to look into other local car wash and detailing services. I'd rather pay more money for a very thorough job than pay $35 for two washes that didn't match my expectations."

However, I have to say, the cake is pretty mediocre. It is hard to get a cake from a bakery. I was charged $3.50 for a cake that was a bit overpriced. I had to call customer service to complain about the cake being just overpriced. I am sure it is just a matter of personal preference, but I have to say that I do not think they have a wide variety of options. I was just in a rush to get there and they had no problem getting my order right. I don't know if they had some other options though, but I would say if you are in the area I would recommend a bakery.Went to this location today with my boyfriend.  We decided to go to the Starbucks on the other side of the street but decided to go to this one on the other side of the street.  The staff was friendly, but not very helpful.  I had to ask for one of the barista to put the order out, I ordered the other one and she just said ""I don't remember.  they don't remember what it, he didn't remember what I remember it.  so I asked for my drink it was on the other."

HOWEVER, I must say this one in particular kinda sucks. I do not  know whether or not they just are not good at customer service, or dont know what customer service is but I have not had many pleasant experiences here. I unfortunately still frequent it because its the only one around here. 

example noted: I get my free drink monthly from my gold starbucks card and I happily order my Toffee Nut latte... me standing there for a good 10 minutes waiting for my drink as the ""barista"" chuckles and laughs with fellow co workers as she makes drinks..one, two , three, four people get their drinks and me.. still standing... waiting.. no one noticing. not the chuckling barista. THEN... when no one else is there finally!!!
finally!! she asks what am I waiting for??? 

reality check starbucks barista girl. in NYC this would not have happened. second the drink was sub par and third I should have gotten a voucher for another free drink considering the amount of time and lack of acknowledgment you gave me.

I'll never get tired of the repurposed factory look, but I always prefer when they can leave out the sterilized steel so the space has an identity greater than ""warehouse."" This place does it well. I do hope they build out a patio at some point -- maybe over some of the underutilized parking lot -- but I'm at least glad they can open the front to get some fresh air in. The place really shines when there's live music. They pick the right tunes for the space, and I easily pick Indiana City as my brewery of choice on a free night if it's a night where there's a show.

The beer itself is better than good, but maybe a couple of hairs shy of great. I don't know how to talk about beer without sounding like a pretentious wine-o, but although I can always find beers that I like here, I don't generally find ones I love. I don't care for stouts and porters, so the Shadow Boxer isn't my bag, but I've heard good reviews from friends who are into it. The others are pretty standard fair -- the flavors aren't too complex, but they aren't dull, either.

If you're on a beer tour of Indianapolis, keep Indiana City as a stopover, but keep it simple so you can enjoy the space. Start off with a few sips of different beers to find one you like, and stick with pints of that for the night."

Very friendly to answer questions about ingredients if you have any but most of that info is plastered on the wall so just look around. Parking: it's right on the rowan campus so tons of foot traffic. Plenty of parking whether street or parking garage. It is free for 2 hours in the area so there shouldn't be any issues. Food: bowls are sooo fresh, they make it right there. Fruits have all been delicious. I've tried the special bowls, the coconut bowls and the açaí, all with varying toppings. Still waiting to try the green bowls and some of the chia bowls. Sooo many to choose from. I tried the chia bowls today and it grew on me, initially was off putting, but by the 4-5 bite, it was actually pretty good. Prices: a little bit more pricey than it should be. It is right on campus so I imagine this may need to eventually be adjusted unless I'm oblivious to the worth of the average student around here. Overall, a great place, I enjoy the freshness of everything. I have a loyal card and can't wait for my free bowl cause free always is best.

They also have the supreme (made of pecans instead of peanuts) and a peanut butter goo goo.  I'm a fan of the original one.  The PB seemed to have too much PB for me.  My hubby loves PB (he loves reese's cups), but goo goo pb was way too much PB for him to enjoy it as a candy bar.

When we went, they also had special summer chef series goo goo, which were remixed recipes made by famous chefs.  The flavors were interesting.  Some had potato chips.  I was lucky enough to try the pretzel one and another with the hazelnut and rice crispy.  I hope they keep those flavors around.  

I enjoyed the little history that was on the wall, the area where you can watch how goo goo clusters are made, the free samples, and the packaging/bag.  The chocolates can be pricey but each goo goo can feed 2 people IMO.  I brought some home for my fam and friends and they all liked the original goo goo.  It's a great souvenir!

The reason for the 4 stars is for lack of signage.  For a newbie/tourist, I needed more description on the shelf and a price tag that actually corresponds to what's on the shelf (they were mismatched).  There was also the lack of friendliness and attentiveness of the workers when we were there.  They were not approachable nor welcoming."

Food,4.5,OR,"Seven years and 22+ check-ins later and I realize I had wrongly only granted this sweet local biz four stars. This is one of my favorite places in town and I'm gonna right that wrong.

On my most recent visit, we were looking for a chill place to de-Carnival. You know what I mean. We wanted to avoid the Lundi Gras revelry and just relax in one of those sweet window seats. This place is a true locals hang. Yes, it's a wine shop, with a great selection of bottles (and quality affordable ones at that), but I like to order by the glass and enjoy the scene because there's always interesting conversation and meet-ups happening. It was a more quiet night, but there was a dog that we made friends with. I mean, he ran away from his people who were gathered at the long bar to sit on our laps! Never had that happen to me before, but there's the magic of Faubourg Wines. 

There's always something delicious by the glass and it's only 5 bucks. Where are you going to get a deal like that in town? My first glass was a sparkling red, similar to a dry Lambrusco. Apparently it was a rare bottle and sorry to say, that they are probably not getting more of it. I like that it makes things seem extra special. And anyway, you can follow that glass up with another excellent $5 red, white or sparkling.

The decor is great and it's definitely a great place to get some work done. There are plenty of tables to sit and have a coffee. The place is also very cute and clean. There's a bar area outside if you want to stay for a while. I can't wait to come back!I LOVE this place! The coffee is amazing, the service is great, and the atmosphere is super cute. They have a big patio with tables and chairs. I love the rustic feel and the great natural light. I'll be back for sure!This place is my favorite coffee place in the area. I've had a few bad experiences here, and the coffee is great, but I haven't had any of the pastries here. The atmosphere is really cozy and chill, and the staff are super friendly. I highly recommend this place for coffee and pastries.I'm always a fan of this store and would never go to a different store, but today I will be back for the Sams or the other stores on my job to Sams.  if I'm not going to the one location.

Food,3.5,OR,"Funky location at a fork in the road. Hard to get into this location if you're on Curlew coming from McMullen booth to Tampa rd. You would either need to make a U-turn on Tampa then make a left turn OR turn left into the Dollar Tree / Marshall's parking lot, drive down to the Tampa rd side then turn right onto Tampa rd and turn an immediate right into the Starbucks parking lot. If you're coming from Hillsborough to Tampa Rd or Curlew it's fine.

Now that I think of it...I don't know if I've ever been to a Starbucks drive thru that was ""normal."" 

When I have an early Dr. Appt in Clearwater I come here on my way home as I'm usually rushing to get to a scheduled conference call or I'm just too lazy to park and get out that early in the morning.

This location is not as much of a hassle as the one on Memorial & Hillsborough, but it shares a parking lot with a Panera Bread and has the potential of getting congested. 

The baristas at the window are nice enough and I've only had luke warm mochas from here once in a while. Today my Toffee Nut Mocha was nice and hot! I'm not sure who used to supply Starbucks pastries, but I've never been a huge fan of the pastries because they are usually to rich and they linger with the taste of preservatives. Recently Starbucks just started carrying this line of French pastries that they call 'La Boulange' which includes a chocolate croissant. I get it hot, so although it's good, it's deflated the way that microwaves deflate pastries."

I do recommend to anyone that is in the area.This was a wonderful experience. It was a wonderful experience. I had a great time. Our tour guide, Bob, was great! I'm a HUGE fan of whiskey, and I was very excited to see that this was a local business. Bob was knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and passionate about the product. The guy who took our tour was very knowledgable and friendly. He explained the different liquors. The owner, I learned about the process and the history of the history of the distillery and history of the distillery and made the way they were created and the products. He gave us in detail about the history of the history of the whole process of the distillery,"
Food,4.5,OR,"Can I give this place 392 stars? I almost don't want to write this review cuz i want to keep this gem to myself....butttttt Mike & Tom deserve this review. 

We were on a LIME scooter ride on the greenbelt, and this little set up caught our eye. We paused and discussed going over to check it out. A guy at the bar yelled to us ""It's better over here! We have beer!"" Come to find out this was co-owner Mike who is such a great person. We were roped in! 

We sat at the cool bar on the tree stump stools (this place is SO COOL!) and were immediately sold. Tom was talking about these drinks called Boozies. (my new favorite thing) I of course had to try one. They come in grapefruit or cranberry. GO FOR THE GRAPEFRUIT! And this is what I drank ALL. DAY. $7/can. Didn't even care. 

They brought out 2 cornhole boards and we ruled the court! Probably played 20 games and met so many cool and new people in the process. A band started up around 7, and it was a great vibe. 

other notes - 
- only 2 portapotties, but were relatively clean.
- Boozies, and 3 beers from Western Collective. The IPA was good! 
- food trucks & live music! 
- amazing view of the river
- big umbrellas for shade / if that's your thing.  

Mike and Tom deserve major high fives for this rad place. What might look like a gravel lot with some old spools & tree stumps - officially kicked off my 2019 summer. Planning on coming back every time I'm in town! Thank you for the memories!"

The Cinnamon Toast Crunch has a very mild cinnamon flavor with a strong cinnamon flavor.  It has a very mild cinnamon taste and is very sweet.  It's very moist and sweet.

Food,4.5,OR,"I called to make an order for a birthday party and requested a ""donut shaped cake"". Although polite there was some confusion on what kind of donut I wanted. I wanted a donut cake. A cake in the shape of a donut with the center hole. Surely a bakery would be able to and make it. I saw tons of donut birthday cakes on Pinterest and thought nothing of giving them a call. For some strange reason they refused the ""hole in the center"" idea. Stating they could make a regular circle flat cake and decorate it to ""look"" like a donut. Huh? No. I wanted an actual cake in the shape of a donut. The individual I was talking to asked me how many guest I was having and suggested a one tier cake. In a circle. Decorated to look like a donut. : / I politely hung up and said thank you. After looking at their website I realized that all the cakes were basically tier cakes in circle or square shapes with decorations on top. I wasn't really that impressed. I ended up buying a donut shape pan on Amazon, saved a ton of money and made the cake myself. It wasn't hard at all. No I'm not a baker. Not even close. The pan cost about 15$. I still don't understand why they couldn't just make a donut cake and why the baker insisted that she make a flat tier cake in the shape of a donut. ?? Aside from that I've never eaten anything from here so I can't review the taste of their baked goods. However following my experience I won't be calling them again."
Food,2.0,CG,"I agree with everyone else, this place is a chain. I will say that the variety of flavors is a bit limited. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. The only thing that I do think is that the prices are a bit high. I think this is the only place I can get a sweet tooth. I think it's a great place to study or meet up with friends. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a sweet treat. Love this place!  The coffee is amazing, the service is great, and the atmosphere is super cute. I highly recommend this spot!  They have a great selection of coffee, and some great baked goods. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's not close to my house and I live a few blocks away and don't have much of a drive. I would recommend coming here if you're in the area. I was just in town visiting family and wanted to stop in for a coffee before a game of basketball. I went to Starbucks and was greeted by the friendly staff and was greeted by a very nice older gentleman. The coffee was excellent and was very smooth and I loved it. iced. The atmosphere was a good.

Food,5.0,OR,"Meridian now has two empanada joints on Fairview and I had to try them out. Empanada Club is easily accessible off of Fairview with tons of parking available. The restaurant is on the end of a strip mall allowing for it to have tons of window seating inside. As you enter the restaurant you will be greeted with a super friendly employee that will walk you through their menu and answer any questions. Inside you will find plenty of seating and a very clean restaurant. You will find the customer service to be amazing and friendly. After getting my tour of the menu I ordered the traditional and the chicken/chimichurri along with both dipping sauces. The traditional was filled with tasty beef, olives, and an egg. The combination works to my disbelief. The tart olive was a great punch inside the little pie of goodness. The chicken item was my favorite of the two (they have 7 other flavors I need to try still). The chicken was juicy and the sauce was great. The two sauces were a great addition to the pies with their chimichurri sauce as my favorite. The sauces add a bit of moisture to the bites which is helpful as the dough was sometimes a bit dry. The only caution I have is the paper that they seved the empanada's on. Once you get the paper wet or tear it from the knife, it's over. a mess of paper and shredding begins. Either grab that empanada by the hand and go finger food style, or cautiously cut your empanadas on the paper. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody as  I plan on going back many times."

All the usual suspects can be found in the aisles - obscure candies, beautiful cookies and cakes, canned EVERYTHING, inexpensive produce and spices, and of course the  fresh fish in the back. BUT - it's the vegetarian frozen food section that slays me. Ham, duck, lamb, fish, meatball, turkey - you name it, it exists in veg form. They have canned vege mutton (delicious) and my favorite canned quail eggs - about 11 different brands. For those who walk in and NEED TO FEED THEIR FACE IMMEDIAMENTE - there is a little corner with roasting ducks ready to be made into a platter for eat-in or take-away. I am so lucky to have this store 2 blocks from my apartment.

This is another list review.

Pros:

1. The counter staff was friendly...that's it.

Cons:

1. My car wash, which I paid $22 for, was a disappointment. The exterior was OK, but the machine wash takes care of most of that. The interior was the problem. The dash was still dusty, the windshield was not clean to the edges and it felt like for what I paid they didn't do anything. The car was already in decent shape, but for $22 I got about $10 of service. To make matters worse, that parking lot had some black slushy stuff on it (from the weather I'm sure) and the guy left a nice dark footprint on my ""clean"" floormat. I know I'm being kinda picky, but I am a car person...and I am very particular when it comes to my vehicles. It was the first time at a car wash that I actually split the tip I was going to leave and kept the rest. If you know me, I love to tip and show my appreciation, not today.

2. The patrons were for lack of a better term...douche bags. It's like all the pretentious people of Kirkwood, Glendale and Ladue all showed up at the same time as I did to get their cars washed. They were not friendly and very off-putting.

3. The facility must cost a fortune, and that's why such a cheap wash costs so much. There is a massive Jelly Belly dispenser inside for jeebus sake!!!

I normally go to Cardinal car wash, and now I know why. I only went to Water Way because Cardinal was closed. I will just wait in the future...or hit up a touch wash at a reputable gas station."
Food,4.0,OR,"Wegmans is my small town oasis.  It's like if Whole Foods and Acme had a baby.  You can find honest to god ANYTHING here.  This is truly one-stop shopping, whether you're vegan, gluten-free, all organic, or couldn't care less.  My mom loves shopping here when she knows I'm coming home.  She can get all her usual stuff, and also grab vegan cheese for me.  The bakery is great, I love their sourdough.  They even have a small bulk section, so I don't have to buy a big bag of expensive nuts when I only need half a cup.  I've found everything from Go Max Go peanut butter cups to Hurraw! lip balm to Pacifica candles here, this place is amazing.

And then there's the prepared foods.  There's so much good stuff!  It's one of the few places I feel cool with grabbing sushi from a supermarket, and they usually have awesome and inventive vegan rolls, like mango and tofu.  The seaweed salad is on point, too, and it's turned my mom into a seaweed believer.  My husband loves the Indian hot bar.  It's not the best, but it's comforting and it hits the spot.

AND THEN there's the beer.  There are crazy laws in Pennsylvania that prevent grocery stores from selling alcohol, but Wegman's craftily put a pub and a beverage store within their store, making the impossible possible.  I can get Einstok and Dogfish Head and Yuengling, AND all of my groceries.  Even in California, I don't usually find Einstok at the grocery store, so this place is truly heaven.

Thanks for making vegan speciality items (and beer) so accessible!"

I came in to pick up a few dozen cake pops for my daughter's birthday.  The girl working was very friendly and helpful.  I got the strawberry shortcake with a raspberry frosting.  It was absolutely amazing!  

I will be back to try other flavors.  

The only downside is they have a small parking lot, which is not always the case at the downtown location.  I'd recommend going early in the morning.  It's a bit of a drive, and the parking lot is packed.  I've never been to a bakery before and was a little disappointed.  

I'll be back to try other flavors.  If you're not a fan of sweets, try the pistachio, chocolate chip, and chocolate chip.  They also have other delicious treats on display.   I'll definitely be back!I love this place! It's always crowded, I usually go there after work and it's a lot!  but it's a lot of fun. They have everything.  Great selection and the staff.

Food,4.0,OR,"I stopped in to check it out, as I often buy groceries from Latin types of stores. As you walk in, there is a display with a large amount of different Latin pastries. They don't appear to have been made in house, but they looked fresh. One corner of the store has a decently sized produce aisle with a good selection of the usual items, and some other produce that I am not that familiar with. Everything looked like it was in good shape and reasonably priced. There is the usual aisle of Goya canned goods and a frozen section where you can find a lot of premade items heat and serve type items. I cam in primarily to check out the meat department, as I was wanting some skirt or flank steak. They had two large pieces on display, and I asked for one of them, 2.64 lbs, and it looked like it was in good shape. 7.99 per lb... which is reasonable. Meat Dept. staff was very friendly and helpful! Cashier was very nice, and I got checked out. (Being able to speak a little Spanish helped here, as I got the impression that not many of the staff spoke much English, but as mentioned... very helpful and friendly staff). When I got the meat home, I was a little disappointed.. as I had to trim about a half pound of smelly, oxidized meat and fat off of it. It was not in bad shape, I am just pretty picky. But after a trim, it was good quality meat, and was delicious after marinating and grilling!

Very convenient.  I came here yesterday after receiving an email from my doctor that the script was sent to CVS.  To my surprise, no order & no script.  Not a happy camper.  The pharmacist said that he couldn't do anything, which I totally agree.  I couldn't call my doctor given that I was at CVS after the doctor's office was closed for the day.  So, I emailed my doctor yet again today & this time was told that they mistakenly sent the script meant for CVS to Express Scripts.  They would send another one & told me that CVS had it.  After coming back from the city, I stopped by.  Another issue happened.  The darn thing didn't go through since it was a duplicate claim.  The kind pharmacy tech (I wish I got her name) went above & beyond to get me my meds.  She understood my frustration with this mess.

Are these people brain dead? And the only Walmart in Reno NOT to accept cash at the self checkout in this time of covid and self distancing. Not only was I forced to deal with a rude and slovenly cashier who when I approached didn't even have the courtesy to say hello but then took her time to have THREE more sips of her coffee before even beginning to check me out. On top of that she couldn't even count and gave me too much change back and couldn't understand me when I told her that. I finally gave up trying to do the right thing and just left. The last time I was in this store there was a line of people at her register because it was the only one open taking cash and she couldn't get her draw open.

* The friendliest staff you can imagine. I've never been without at least one person asking me if I needed any help. Even better they always know where to find something. If you ask for help with something you don't get blank stares or puzzling looks when you are searching for that unknown item in your ingredients list. 
* If they don't have something you want, just ask, they will order it and keep it in stock. I asked for a specialty craft beer and now whenever I visit it is always in stock.
* The lines are never long and most of the staff actually know how to bag groceries.
* Even the shoppers seem more pleasant here. 
* There are always carts or hand baskets available. Its incredible how many other places overlook this simple requirement. 
* Publix subs!!! Why are these so good? I don't know. It is just a deli sub. It doesn't make any sense. Give them all to me + extra Cubans.

* Prices are a little higher than some other popular grocery stores. I tend to offset this by buying Publix brand items whenever possible. The quality is just as good and they are probably even the same as the name brand items minus the higher price to justify marketing costs. 
* Wish they were open later. I cry when it is after 10PM and i am forced to visit another establishment.

I got a cookie for my daughter's birthday and it was delicious!  I picked up the chocolate chip cookie and it was the perfect size for my daughter's birthday. I was very disappointed with the cookie. The cookies were warm and a little crumbly, but still soft, which I appreciate. I liked the cookie better than the ones I had ordered. The chocolate chip cookie was really good, but it was not my favorite. I'll be going back and trying the other cookie. I went here to pick up a gift for my mother. She has a severe severe autism and she was having a bad day. I spoke to the owner and she was very helpful and was willing to help me. I was told by the cashier that she would call me back and order another gift. She was very kind and explained to me that she was a member and was more than accommodating to the gift and was very understanding and I was able to help her job to help me. I had a gift carded her.

Food,4.0,OR,"Very fun and cool dessert spot!

Definitely a must-try, especially if you've never had rolled ice cream, or Nitrogen dipped dessert because this place serves both!

Decorations - very cool, blue, and kinda club-like. Cool lighting, metal/silver tables (not too much seating,) and very modern. The place is small, so it gets packed quickly!

Service was good; we tried this place during the week day and it was still busy but workers were efficient. 

Rolled Ice cream - they have the usual pre-made flavors and combos, which is better and easy, if you're not too creative/lazy to customize your own, or just don't know what to get. We tried one and it's definitely enough for 2. So very delicious. 

Liquid nitrogen dessert - you choose what items you'd like (options: brownie bites, donut holes, honeybuns, Swiss Rolls, wafers.) One dipper is $4.99 and two dippers are $5.99. You get a cup of liquid nitrogen. You're provided with sticks...you poke the item, let's say brownie bite, dip it into the cup of liquid nitrogen for a couple seconds, and then eat it. As you breathe out, you'll see smoke (from your nostrils or mouth,) which is why they call it ""Dragon's Breath."" It was good, yes. But my most favorite dessert ever? Not really. It reminds me of MRE's, like the freeze-dried fruit or whatever. You'd know what I mean if you were/are Military, or had a parent or spouse who was. You have to return the cup of unused nitrogen so that it can be disposed of properly. 

So yes, definitely try the Dragon's Breath dessert at least once. It's definitely a novelty thing. But also try their rolled ice cream because it's delicious! This place makes for cool snapchats and vids."
Food,4.0,CG,"One of the main reasons I love the market is that it is a bit further away from the other major downtown markets. The people who work here are very nice, and it is pretty nice to have a little bit of a selection of items. If you are looking for something specific, you can find it here. I do wish they had a few items on their menu, like the cheesesteak or the chicken kielbasa. The prices are reasonable, and I love that they have a lot of fresh produce, so I will definitely be back for more. They have a lot of local items and some of the things you can buy at the market. The only downside is that it is hard to find the items that are listed on the shelves. It is a bit of a drive, but it is worth the wait. This place is amazing!!

I  am HUGE on customer service.   Knowing that today was national donut day you would think that they would have been better staffed and prepared.   I  stood in line for 20 minutes and when I got up to the register the employee was grumpy and did not even respond  to my ""good morning ""  :-(  Not only were they not customer friendly but they did not have one of the most popular donuts available.   I  made it my mission to make the cashier smile before I left so after I paid for my donuts I  tipped him and  said, have a wonderful day and don't forget to smile.   Not only do you have control of your happiness but you have the opportunity to affect someone else in a negative or positive way.  Let's  make it a good day.  He smiled and said, ""thank you, I needed that "".

As a company you should always protect your brand.  On a day such as this you want to give your customers a reason and reminder of why you are a household name and we should keep coming back.  

Although my customer service experience was not the best I had the chance to positively affect one of Krispy Kreme employees  and my employees are bouncing off the walls! !"

Food,3.5,OR,"terrible experience at the bar after having dinner in town, and looking for a nice quaint place to have a glass of wine before ending the evening. When we walked in it was quiet, with a few guests at the bar, and 2 couples in the front on the banquette area. The server, Kate, seemed incredibly hurried and lost. We ordered a bottle of water, until we could decide which wines we wanted to select. My girlfriend ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, and I was undecided. It took nearly 10 minutes to get the Pinot Grigio, and when she returned I ordered my glass of red wine. That was the last time we saw her until she presented us with the check upon my request. I had to ask the bartender if my wine was coming. She had no idea what I was talking about.  I asked her to just tell the server we wanted our check, which she was incredibly quick and efficient getting. 
The server did apologize and made a half hearted attempt to explain something about too many tables and not enough help.......sorry... But that's NOT my problem. 
 On the positive side, the bartender was making an attempt to help the situation and did all she could, but it was too little too late. I asked her if there was a manager, and she said that they didn't have a manager, but that the owner was ""kind of"" the manager and she wasn't there. I'm not sure what that means, but again, I feel like she was at least making an attempt.

That's typical of Walgreens, but this one always has exceptional service. 

I am a regular customer to this location.

The Easter merchandise is 90% off right now, so be careful if you go in, because the system didn't recognize it was 90% off.
I was initially overcharged,  but then I went back to the Easter section to check the prices and an employee seen me and came up and asked me if I had any concerns and if I thought the wrong  prices were charged to me, I advised her that I was mischarged & the manager was walking up to us at the same moment and heard our conversation, and then  I also had conversation with the manager and the issue was immediately taken care of, right then and there! 
He went through the receipt and then apologized profusely, (so did the employee that came up to me the first time) as none of the entire purchase rang up correctly, and he made things right and refunded me. 

The manager told me that it might take a while because he had to do it manually, he told me this even before we walked over to vacant register to take of it, and that was totally o.k. with me. 
I appreciate him informing me that it would take longer than just your typical 60 second checkout time. I was taken care of and accommodated very well.

Everyone was willing to work for me and get the problem made right!!
Everyone was friendly amis a Walgreens system failure, that is NOT the employee's fault.

The manager also had a very nasty attitude towards the customer. I had to call customer service to report him to the manager. He had to leave the store and tell the manager. He told me that he was not going to call me back. I told him I had never been in this store before and he did not know how to do it. He was very unprofessional and not willing to help.

So, I drove the 6-1/2 miles to the nearest store and signed up for a card. It seems all stores must have a card now. The store is huge and it took me 2 hours to check it out. The First thing I noticed was the cluttered look of the entire place. There are stands and displays encroaching on all aisles. They make the shopping experience go pretty slowly. Many of the shelves were quite depleted of stock. I have to admit I was shopping fairly late, I started at 8pm. The clerk that checked me out was talking to everyone within earshot except me. When she finished my order she didn't ask for my card, just gave me the total. I showed her the card and she entered it by taking the numbers one at a time. Her hand-held scanner was broken. I had not noticed that she packed my sushi on its side and put a greeting card in with it. By the time I got home the sushi looked like garbage and the sauce was on the card. In the parking lot there was a leak in the drip system that was spraying a 10 foot fountain onto the asphalt. A terrible waste of water! There were huge oil spots in most of the parking spaces including mine. I had a time loading my groceries into my car and trying not to walk in it.

The whole place has tons to do, it feels like the dream of a Freshmen College boy come true: a place full of beer, arcade games and sports.They also had a football game projecting on the wall which was cool. They also had a pet adoption event going which I absolutely loved! 

I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was comfortably packed. It seems like it is well attended by locals, people came with their families (and small children) and even dogs to grab a beer. Many people brought in pizza from a nearby place, but there is nothing actually walkable to get food from. I know some reviews mentioned food trucks, I guess that's only on certain days.

I love breweries because I like tastings, and although they won't sell you a flight, it is a $1 a small pour (the size of a small tasting glass) and if you get four, they do give you a contraption to hold them in. A larger beer is $2, so not a bad deal either! I had the bartender pick out 4 and we picked another 4 to taste almost everything on tap. The bartender asked if it was our first time here and gave me a few tastes on the house! Thanks!

I would really like to come back with a group of friends and get some healthy competition going with all the games they have here. I wouldn't mind returning for a game either, as the place seemed pretty lively for a Sunday afternoon as well.  Overall, look forward to coming back!"

Food,5.0,OR,"Love this place! I really enjoy that Craft is both a store and a bar. 

About the store:All of their employees undergo the Cicerone test to gain some vital beer knowledge. Anybody who you talk to behind the bar is going to know how to help you choose a shiny new to you beer without the pretentious ""oh you mean you haven't heard of this totally elitist beer thing?! Gasp!"" Even though Craft Beer Cellar is in ritzy Clayton this is a very approachable establishment. In fact, none of the employees are going to give you a personal opinion/ information about a beer they haven't personally tried. They will, however, tell you what they heard about it, invite you to try it, and ask to give them your own review. You can build your own 4 or 6 pack, reasonable prices, and crazy good selection of craft beer. Also, a pretty nice rewards point system.

About the bar: I love that you can grab a beer here, sit, chat, and actually hear the person next to you. The experience at the bar is about the beer they serve and the people there: it's not about pushing you to buy more drinks and rack up a tab, it's not dim lights and dubstep, it's not skimpy outfits or sports. It's beer on tap or any beer you chose in store (plus a $1 open fee) and a well-lit place to sit, sip, and talk. Right next to a bathroom too. Not shabby. 

The best part about Craft Beer Cellar? If you can't go to them they'll head your way. They deliver alcohol. I'll say it again. They. Deliver. Alcohol. Booze right to your door. Sweet, right?

The atmosphere here is open and inviting. I usually sit in a little corner right behind the area where they make their drinks and they bring it right out to me. I don't expect them to, but they always do so as a result I always tip. 

The coffee is pretty good. I always order the same thing everywhere I go - white mocha with amaretto. Thank dog Idaho likes amaretto; it's hard to find at coffee shops in California. My mocha is always right on the verge of too sweet, but not quite there. I should probably just ask for an extra shot of espresso or one less shot of amaretto. I'll do that next time and update on the taste portion here. 

The employees: super awesome friendly peeps. They always have a smile for me and a little bit of small talk. They always seem busy when you walk in but are quick to come help you when you're ready. 

The pastries, as is the case with most coffee spots, are mediocre and overpriced. Save yourself a few bucks and buy an entire dozen giant muffins from CostCo, then wrap them individually in saran wrap. Boom. Done. 

Overall, definitely a decent place. I come here several times a week to work since there are less distractions here than at home. Yes, I said there are LESS DISTRACTIONS at the outdoor mall than there are in my house. So now you know why I am always reviewing coffee places.

These donuts are rich but somehow light and some flavors are flaky but there is a density to the layers. Sounds incredibly complex, but that's the only way I can think to describe this. 
I brought 6 home with me from Nashville, on a plane. Yes, I'm that person. The box was absolutely sturdy enough so I had to try (and succeed). Each flavor almost had a different texture. It was impressive. I gave a vanilla creme and Chocolate Sea Salt to my mom for keeping my dog. My boyfriend got a chocolate with sprinkles and a glazed. I kept the chocolate malt peanut butter and a chocolate sea salt for myself. Since I only have one picture, you see how well the tastings went.... 
I took a bite of the chocolate with sprinkles and glazed from my boyfriend, they were probably my favorite. I'll gladly try some of the rich, decadent flavors but because of the complexity of 100 layers, the simple stuff really hit home. The glazed was easily my favorite. 
Be aware that some of the flavors have a filling between those 100 layers. No idea how they make that happen but if you like rich and heavy pastries, you're going to the right place.

I was so excited, mostly because we had nothing like it only months ago.

It's all self service, so that's pretty cool, though I felt like I was back in the dorms. You pay by the ounce which sounds pretty great, but it can end up being expensive when you're not paying attention to your portions. The toppings are self serve too which is a pleasant surprise. Though the toppings aren't extremely fresh, they do have a good variety of fruits, candies, and granola. 

Fro-Yo has quite a few flavors, but I only had the original tart (fantastic!) and I had a sample of the New York Cheesecake. That was definitely one I'll go back for.

I reserved my last star even though I loved it for a few reasons. 
- The only reason I knew I could get a sample was because I read a few Yelp reviews mentioning it. They weren't visible, and the guy at the counter almost seemed annoyed I asked.
- Brings me to my second point being that the guy at the counter REALLY didn't seem to care that he was employed. Not that it really mattered to me because I literally only needed him to check me out. However, I asked about one of the toppings and he didn't even know what it was! Useless! Honestly, they could probably replace his position with a self checkout like the grocery store. 
- My last reason for that last star? It's NOT Pinkberry.....but the taste is damn close!"

For more than a century Bassett's has been gracing the Philadelphia region (and some surrounding areas via distribution) with their amazing ice cream. My first trip to Bassett's was also my maiden voyage to the Mecca that is Reading Terminal and that trip was actually for DiNic's roast pork. Once that goal was met, I turned my sights to dessert, and when it's the heat of summer, ice cream always sounds like a winner. But Bassett's took much more than just the gold medal, so much so that the cold and rainy February Sunday that made up my most recent trip meant nothing to me. I was partaking in butter pecan creaminess no matter what!

That's my go to flavor...okay, I'm often a creature of habit and I just can't shy away from the sweet and buttery ice cream with lovely pieces of nutty pecans. It just hits the spot so well. That being said, the other flavor options are totally worthy of a try. My buddy got banana which could possibly call to me enough on my next visit to mix things up. Unfortunately/fortunately I'm not here enough to try all the flavors, but that's a blessing in disguise for my gut.

Overall, Bassett's is a true classic. They've been hanging out in Reading Terminal forever and are just waiting for you to discover and return to have their creamy desserts.

It's a tiny space with only about 3 small tables. As you enter there is a small case with homemade Italian desserts, cookies, cannoli and eclairs to name a few. The counter wraps around and on the right side is the Gelato case. It housed 18 flavors, a few of which were Sorbetos. 

My favorite flavor is chocolate of course, but I like to combine it with something that contrasts and enhances. There were a few here which would fit the bill, I selected salted caramel to go with the Belgian dark.i loved both choices, there were tiny flakes of chocolate in the dark, and mini caramel cups in the salted. It will be difficult not to repeat this same recipe on future visits, but I will attempt to change it up. Trish ordered chocolate chip, it was good but not as rich as mine.

We thought the prices were fair for the product, my larger serving was $5 and probably more than I really needed, but I was weak. My only worry about this shop is in the way it is set up. The owners should consider moving the frozen case to the front and desserts to the rear. One thing that really impresses me in ice cream shops is when water is offered free of charge( instead of the profiteers who sell bottled) here they go a step further and have cucumber water. 4.5, so good we even came the following day Yelps ( butter pecan was incredible)"
Food,2.5,CG,"This was the most chaotic time of the year and I was in and out in about 5 minutes. I had to wait in line for at least 10 minutes and the person who helped me was extremely rude and unhelpful. I will never shop here again and will drive far to another store.I'm not a huge fan of Krispy Kreme's, but I've heard great things about their croissants and their cinnamon rolls. 

However, when I got home from work to make sure my order was correct, I called the store and was told that I had to wait in line and wait. So I called the store and was told that the order had been made by the morning crew and that I would have to wait in line for my order. 

The store manager also said that the manager would look into the situation and find out if the order was correct, but that the person was the only customer in the store. 

So I went to the store and got the order, but was told that the order was not made. The manager was able to call me, but told me that I would have to tell him I would have to wait in the order.

Food,2.5,OR,"As far as the retail section of the store goes, no problem. Regular old CVS.

The pharmacy though?  I KNOW it's not easy to get a PharmD or even be a pharmacy technician.  What the fug is going on here?

For five years I have struggled with this pharmacy...lost prescriptions, filling the wrong prescriptions, lines that take forever, claiming I have no insurance, pawing through bags of prescriptions because mine is lost...

Today...I'm firing you.  My doctor called in a script for Ambien, which I need, once, maybe twice a year because my sleep gets all wacky...nbd.  I go to pick it up, and they had filled an old birth control script (like...almost eight months old...).  But wait, someone from CVS had called me to say specifically, ""your Ambien is here and ready"" - me: ""Really? I never got the automated message"" - person: ""Oh! Well it's here.""

Fast forward to today, they paw around through bags, and paper, and then one woman comes up to me and whispers...""do you not have insurance?? I see you paid cash last time.""  Yes, I paid cash because I needed my bc early because I was going on a trip and my insurance company wouldn't cover it because I was picking it up before the time frame allowed blah blah blah...BUT MY SHIZ IS STILL VALID!  

Anyway, I literally feel like my head is going to explode - I told them that I have to take my business elsewhere because I've dealt with this headache for five years and can't do it anymore.

Thankfully, I have good health and this wasn't a do or die medication, just an annoyance. Be warned though!  If you need medicine, you just might not get it if you go to this CVS."

Food,4.5,OR,"We have been visiting the bake shop since they opened.  We love their food - especially their baked goods.  However, after the experience we just had there, we will NOT be returning.  
I will start by saying while they had a decent crowd there, we ordered a bagel, two pancakes, and a bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwich.  50 minutes later, we had only received the bagel.  At that point, we asked how much longer our food would be.  I felt like at that point, a 50-minute wait time for pancakes and a simple sandwich was on the extreme side.  The waitress we asked checked, and came back with the news that it would be ""at least 10 more minutes"".  We immediately asked for the check for our orange juices and bagel, as we wanted to just pay for what he had and leave.  She complied, and another waitress said ""I'm sure you'll get a discount for waiting"".  I'd rather not have a discount.  Honestly, this experience has caused me to decide that we will not return for our weekly visit - not even for the baked goods.  

I would recommend that anyone in the Bristol area looking for a good breakfast on a Sunday morning (or any morning for that matter) look into Itri (right next door) where you won't wait an hour for a pancake, Radcliffe Cafe (you may wait a few minutes for a seat, but you will at least get your food in less than an hour), or one of the many diners in the area.

An Avon lady, jewelry vendors, limited edition cereal boxes.  Cheese shops, a baker, and some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  

We were starving, so we first stopped at the Umbrian stand and purchased a loaf of italian bread, 500mL of Italian extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 lb of domestic prosciutto, 1/4 lb sharp provolone: $18.  Then we proceeded to feast at a small table just outside the shop (with plenty left over).

UPDATE: We stopped here this weekend and were so happy to find a Rosemary Christmas tree.  Yes, it's small (2.5' tall), but it's great!  The last time I had one I accidentally killed it, and subsequently made lots of rosemary infused olive oil.  This time, whether I kill it or not (I don't have a green thumb), I will do the same.  If at all possible, I'll keep it living.  It truly is the best type of holiday tree one could find--it's edible--and at $10.99, can't be beat for us small apartment dwellers."

However my experience today was AWFUL, and it truly broke my heart because I've been going there for a long time, but our ""server"" was so rude, didn't check on us once, offer to refill our water, and didn't even bring us one of the items we ordered, or apologize for it. A large party had come in and were so loud and obnoxious that we chugged our tea and got out of there as soon as we could. When the guy who was working finally came to ring us up, he reluctantly took off the item we never received, and didn't even give us our discount for being members even though we had told him at the beginning we were, so we over paid for a really horrible experience...

Food,4.0,OR,"I visited Midtown Wine and spirits and am really pleasantly surprised. It has a huge selection and the prices are fair. I will start with the liquor. It's the most comprehensive I have ever seen and my favorite thing is that they provide several sizes of each brand they offer. This will definitely be my go to place if I am trying to make a concoction or two. 

The wine selection is also ginormous and they have every price point well covered. They have it well organized and the prices are pretty average for most of the vintages I am familiar with. I like the flow, it appears the more expensive stuff is along the wall and then the ""swill"" as I call it has it's own section. Most of the wine space is devoted to under $20 a bottle selection. 

That being said, here is my only complaint. They advertised over 3000 bottles of wine under $20. I honestly believe it. However, when you carry stock that high, you can't tell me that the owners or staff have tasted it all. It explains why there are tasting notes from either the vendors themselves or notes from wine spectator and that's on maybe 10% of the wines they carry. I really need the notes. I know what qualities i like in a Zinfandel or Malbec for example and so trial and error is not my thing. 

I guess my point is I really think the liquor store is amazing and if you have some specific wines that you like and Midtown carries it then go for it. However, if you are trying to expand your pallet or get some quality suggestions for pairings then I suggest going to Green hills wine shop or Woodland wine merchant. They are the real wine geeks."

Disclaimer:  This review will be quite similar to my review of Nola Snow Snoballs on Vicksburg St, as they are serving the exact same snowballs at 2 Lakeview locations.

I love me some NOLA Snow snowballs.  As I stated in my review of the Vicksburg Street location, ""the owners, Rudy & MiMi, are all about New Orleans.  The staff is always friendly and if they aren't too busy, they'll answer questions about nearly every single flavor on the menu if you are having a hard time deciding on which flavor to get.

Today, we had some family from Arizona at our house and they wanted to get a snowball. We told them all about Nola Snow and advised them that we could be there is less than 5 minutes.  Fast forward 5 minutes and we arrived at the Harrison Avenue location and ordered 4 kiddie sizes as samplers for our out of town guests.  They opted to get cherry, watermelon, coconut and white chocolate macadamia.  All four of these are very good flavors, but in my opinion, nothing tastes better or is more New Orleans than their NOLA nectar.

This location is in the heart of Lakeview, as I like to call it, and caters to what I like to refer to as the ""South side"" of Lakeview.  The service is always friendly and Rudy & MiMi (as well as their daughter) are frequently on-site. This specific location is my go to snowball stand; especially since since it is less than 1 mile from my home.  The only reason I give them 4.5 instead of 5 stars is that sometimes, the ice can be a little coarse and not completely velvety smooth.  However, Nola Snow can hold it's own with any snowball stand in the city."

I do not have a sweet tooth by any means and have always admired Dough for going the savory route on a lot of their pastry's and desserts. I couldn't wait to check out their Bistro menu as their sister restaurant Datz has always been known for culinary creativity.

We started off with a course called Duck Fat Fries. I love duck. I love fries. But I was a little afraid of this dish. Fears begone.....I wanted more and more. I don't believe I even touched the side of garlic aioli. 

Next up on the menu was a surprisingly delicious salad called The Passport. Petite Endives topped with olives, figs, goat cheese, crispy chickpeas and a ""100-year old celery dressing"" recipe. This was one of the better restaurant salads I have ever had. I will put it up there with my top 3, which is in company with the 1905 Salad at Columbia and Houstons original Ceaser Salad. Every bite was magical.

The third dish on our lineup was Roasted baby beet risotto - imported rice, slow-roasted beets, Parmesan cheese, roasted vegetable stock and a hint of Pernod, a liquor made with licorice. I generally hate licorice and beets but liked this dish. I didn't mind the earthiness of the beats and couldn't taste the licorice, although I could smell it in every bite. I loved the goat cheese on top - a great flavor and texture variance.

Our main entree was 'Taste of Salmon', a pan-seared wild salmon with lavender honey sauce, served on top of spinach. It was perfectly seared and the lavender honey sauce was amazing.

Since I work in Haddonfield, I am lucky to be surrounded by quite a few bakeries/pastry shops- however, my go-to spot was about to close, prompting me to go on Yelp and find this place.

When I walked in, the guy behind the counter, Chris, was super friendly and excited to explain all of the different flavor combinations to me. I was immediately impressed by the sheer beauty of these cupcakes- they were big, piled high with frosting, and creatively decorated.

I initially had a serious chocolate craving, but after seeing the blueberry velvet cupcake with the cream cheese frosting, I knew I had to try it. The cannoli cupcake also caught my eye, and I figured why only get one cupcake when I can get 2, right? Right.

I grabbed a fork at the counter and only took 2 steps outside before I dug in to the blueberry cupcake. OH MY GOSH. Best cupcake I have EVER had! 

It was so moist and punched my tastebuds in the face with fresh blueberry flavor. Throughout the soft cake were fresh blueberries, which was a refreshing surprise. The cream cheese frosting was unbelievably smooth and silky, with the just right balance between sweet confectioners sugar, butter, and cream cheese. I housed the entire cupcake in a matter of seconds.

It was SO good that I shamelessly turned around, walked back in and ordered 2 more to bring home. Chris was so thrilled that I enjoyed the cupcake that he gave me a free one! How sweet is that? (Pun intended) :)

Food,4.0,OR,"Sae Han Oriental Food Market has always been a good place to stop n shop for at least the last ten years. I like the wide variety of fresh, dried, and frozen items, although I may not be the best judge, since I'm not skilled at cooking Asian cuisines. Or...any cuisines...but I survive.  The prices are deals on some items, but not on others, and some items feel too expensive for a shopper on a budget, but I would say that it's possible to shop on a budget and even buy things less expensively than at Giant. For example, the produce section, while small, is fresh and priced competitively, and you can come up with creative combinations for fresh salads and cooking. (That is, I don't come in with an idea of what produce I ""have"" to have.) A fairly wide selections of greens, including dandelion greens, etc., but a more basic selection of fruits, though you are sure to find persimmons.

Many of the dried items are far cheaper here than at Giant...rice sticks, vermicelli, etc. (mostly in the noodle-y range). As for other items in the noodle-y range, although they recently stopped selling my favorite brand of Udon noodles, they had a replacement on sale that tasted fine.

There are a lot of household/kitchen goods and tools that seem reasonably priced.

What you are less likely to find inexpensively are snacks/chips, soda, etc., but I am taking this as a sign that these items are meant be be eaten in moderation, not guzzled/ingested to sustain life. That said, I never leave without a bakery packet of red bean cakes next to the register. Yes, it's a life of vice.

P.S. I believe the store is run by a husband-and-wife team, and the wife seems happy to give you tips on cooking if you are unsure about an item."

The owner at Perennial is doing great things. He's doing ballsy things. Like AC/DC ""Big Balls"" things. One new beer, every week, 52 weeks a year, Thursday at 6pm. That's NUTS. 

STL. You are spoiled and you don't even know it. 

The owner cites Jolly Pumpkin as the ballsiest brewer in the country. He's right. They use some sort of crazy wild yeast, brew some hella funky but unique and respected beers... But what he's doing? That takes a whole lot of hutzpah. 

These beers are clever. They are typically a tip of the hat to the great beer country of Belgium, but meant to be lighter. Trust me, I was initially disappointed at the less than 9.0% ABV tap list... but I got over it. I understood it, appreciated it even, that I could have more than 3 beers and not be wrecked. They are different. Appreciate that they are different. This will be the Jolly Pumpkin of STL, maybe even better. 

However, the waitstaff / bartenders ... need some retraining. They cannot handle a full bar seamlessly. There are severe service glitches as the place gets busier. 

Redeeming plus to the inconsistent service? They have some ridiculously sexy cheeses on their cheese board. Amazing cheese with delightfully different yet familiar beers trumps sketchy service any day of the week. 

I beg of you, Saint Louis, love and cherish this place. It is truly one of the best things you have in your city. 

Sincerely,
Chicagoan corrupted and spoiled by Michigan microbrews transplanted in a beer desert known as Houston, TX

PS - if you don't want him, I think Houston could benefit!!!"
Food,3.5,CG,"My husband and I consider ourselves an ice cream fanatic. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and the line was so long that it was a bit tough to get out of the place. There were only 2 people in the store, so it was a little tough to see all the flavors. However, we found the line to be pretty long, which is a great sign since they're all made by the staff. The flavors were all pretty good. The prices are a little high for ice cream, but I would say that the ice cream was really good. I got a ""strawberry and chocolate"" and a ""chocolate"" ice cream. I can't wait to come back and try some other flavors. They have a small patio for those of us who want to cool off and enjoy a treat. 

The only thing I would recommend is to get a spoonful of ice cream. It was not really the best ice cream, but it was tasty. I would definitely recommend getting a scoop of ice cream, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. The prices are very reasonable, and the portions are generous. They also have a good service is friendly and quick. 





The location is in the ice cream is great!

Food,4.5,OR,"I used to come here frequently and it was the perfect little coffee spot. Not too busy and the coffee was great. Now that the shop has gotten more customers, it seems the quality has gone down. I order an iced coffee with liquid sweetener every time. This morning I ordered my coffee and asked for the sweetener. The barista handed over my drink and I did not see her put in any liquid sweetener so I asked again and she pointed me to the raw sugar packets they have out. I thought they had maybe ran out of the liquid sweetener so I tried the packets, but the sugar granules were so big they would not dissolve in my cold drink. I seriously took two sips of pure sugar granules. I asked a different barista if they had liquid sweetener and she said yes, so I had to ask for it to be remade. You could tell they were in a rush and not too happy to remake the coffee, even though I put an emphasis on the sweetener the first time. I got my drink and took a few sips and there was hardly any milk in the drink (I ask for oat milk) and it tasted completely watered down. All I tasted was water with a hint of milk and hardly any coffee. I did not want to bother them again to I left, but by the time I got to my car the ice had completely melted, making the drink taste even more watered down. This place is awesome if you get there at the right time with slower business and the right staff, but I do not recommend going in the AM (especially during the week) because it seems that the staff is rushed and does not pay much attention to your specific order."

Food,4.0,OR,"This Ferguson store is symbolic because it is in the city of and mere miles from the area where a policeman killed an 18-year-old unarmed teen; that sparked a national conversation about the treatment of minorities by the Police and ""policing only for profit"".

Myself and so many others are elated to see this store open. Today is opening day and there is such diversity and a great spirit here. This location is roomier than many others I have seen with additional communal tables added for local meetings to facilitate change. I made a purchase inside and in the drive-thru and the drive-thru lets you see the Barista you're speaking to. I have been to so many stores where the Associates were pleasant but I really felt a strong sense of pride here.

It's so rainy today but my drink is piping hot and taste as I would expect from any other Starbucks. This location also gives Boeing, BJC and Emerson Electric associates additional coffee options. The Associates here where bubbly and of great importance my drink was right (even spelled by name right). For opening day I didn't see any catastrophes happening and everything was well stocked.

Opening a Starbucks will not fix the systematic racial issues in Missouri or the nation as a whole but the visibility and investment (though miles from the devastated area) is noted and appreciated. 

""Show you're brave, those with faith, on a mission, led by intuition"" - you may not live nearby but this is apart of your city. A 14 block radius is not all that encompasses your community. We all drink Starbucks so if you're in the area or even if you're not in the area come show love and support the local people employed here, and a great chain that's doing great things to assist so many - one cup at a time."

There are a lot of flavors to choose from and the flavors are so fresh.  If you like ice cream you should definitely try the cookie butter ice cream.  If you are a fan of cookie butter ice cream you will love it.  This ice cream is a great way to get some ice cream after dinner.  The prices are comparable to other ice cream places.

That's right, The Whirly Pig, artisan porkmongers. There's a cartoon logo of a pig wearing a propeller cap on the side of the truck. The moment I saw the man slice the monstrous slab of pork belly inside the truck, I knew I had to try it. ""If the pork belly tastes half as good as it looks, I'll be satisfied,"" I told my friend Robert. Indeed, the pork belly sandwich exceeded all of my expectations and then some. The honey-topped bun was buttered and toasted. The slaw added a nice tang to the tender roasted pork belly. It reminded me of a high-quality char siu bao (Chinese roast pork bun). On a second visit, I got the Hog Roast Sandwich. Apple slaw and pickles topped six different cuts of meat - pork belly, pork loin, pork butt, pig cheeks, rib meat, and bacon - all inside an onion brioche bun. It was delicious! There are only a handful of sandwiches on the menu and they all look good. You can bet that I'm going to try every one of them over time. It is imperative that you try this truck now. You'll be glad you did! *** May 22, 2014 UPDATE *** Today I bought the Duck Roast sandwich which includes duck confit in pork fat, gala apple slaw, pickle, and bacon in an onion brioche bun. My first bite elicited the words, ""This is frickin' delicious!"" from my mouth. This sandwich is another winner and raises my overall review to a well-deserved 5 stars. I urge you to try the Hog Roast or Duck Roast sandwiches. These are gourmet restaurant quality sandwiches that will put a smile on your face."

Food,3.5,OR,"A clusterf#ck if there ever was one! There's really no other word in the English language to best describe my experience buying a patio set here. Shopping for food may be fine, but when it comes to big-ticket items, no one knows what the heck they are doing. To start, we couldn't even get anyone to come out and help us with the purchase. They just wanted numbers to enter into the register. I finally had to ask one of the customer service reps to come out with me to collect the info they needed so I know I was getting the right items. Begrudgingly they helped. Call me crazy, but when I'm spending over a grand on something, I'd like a little help. Now get this!! When I expressed interest in purchasing the delivery and assembly service, the rep tried to talk me out of it saying it's too expensive and I should just rent a truck and assemble it myself. Nice company representative trying to talk people OUT of purchasing add ons. I went with the service, knowing that it would be worth every dollar for this large set, much to her dismay. The day of delivery, the third-party delivery guys (and that company was great, by the way) point out to me that Sam's had the used floor model waiting for them on the dock. I clearly paid full price for a new item. I called and spoke to the first helpful Sam's representative of my whole experience who told me that every store is out of the model and they would give me a $400 discount. I had to go back to the store yet again to get the refund, but kudos to them for doing the right thing in the end, which bumps them up a star here. I don't recommend doing business with them on large or high-priced items."
Food,2.5,CG,"This review is mainly about the beer, the food. I will admit that I have been a bit disappointed by the beers. I am not a huge beer fan, so I am pretty sure that the majority of the beers are quite good. I enjoy the variety of beers offered in the store and the prices are generally pretty fair. I have had the blueberry wheat beer, which is a nice seasonal beer. The beer is a bit on the higher end, but I would prefer something stronger and sweeter. I'm not sure if I've had better beer at other breweries in the area. I think it's a good thing they've got a bigger selection. The bartender is also very friendly and informative. I was a bit disappointed that he didn't know what to drink, but it was a good experience. I'll definitely be back for a good time.This place is soooo cute!  It's not really the cheapest in town.  There are a lot of varieties of ice cream and there is a ton of topping choices.  They have a large selection of frozen yogurt, which is great for ice cream, and water ice cream.  And water ice.  I got the strawberry water ice cream is good.  The water ice cream is my favorite.  I wish I would be back in the perfect.

Food,4.0,OR,"I used to really enjoy this location. But the past few months every single time we come in here they ask for ID for adult items. My husband and I have been coming here for two years at least three times a week. They know our faces and even the female that works here has our birthdays memorized.

Today I showed up totally forgetting my husband had my ID and they literally refused to sell even though they know we are there and fork over our ID every single time. 

I understand the ""policy"" is to prevent selling to minors. I am clearly not a minor, I am in there all the time - and honestly, if people are going to buy items for minors it doesn't matter if that adult had an ID or not. 

This is getting more and more infuriating and quiet frankly, today (with JC) was the straw that broke the camels back with Walgreens. The way he spoke to me was unacceptable. No more at this location.

PS.....we never have this issue at any other Walgreens in Reno/Sparks or ANY other city we go to.

*** AWESOME info!!!!! I called my husband from the parking lot and told him what happened. I then called Walgreens to ask JC what his district managers name was and had a chat with him from my car. My husband was on his way home passing the Walgreens and went inside to purchase the items I was denied. While he was in line he heard JC arguing with someone on the phone (which was me). When JC hung up he said loudly ""f-bomb hell, now I have to yell at my employees"" in front of everyone in line and started to talk about ME to the customers not knowing my husband was one of the customers. 

Walgreens corporate - I do hope you see this soon."

Food,4.0,OR,"Much like the zebra's stripes, there are contrasting facets about this parlor. And if the term ""ice cream parlor"" can ever be accurately used, it is definitely here. Such a cute shop, and even the seating area looks like you are in a friend's living room. I've been wanting to visit this place for more than 6 months, a dinner nearby on a very warm early spring night made it possible.

There were a few flavors that appealed to me, but based on other reviews I had to try the graham slam paired with gold medal ribbon. The graham was very good with chunks of what seemed to be a crispy marshmallow thing. It made me think of the texture of the marshmallows in ""bad"" cereals. I loved the contrast of textures. The medal flavor is a mix of dark chocolate and French vanilla with a caramel swirl. I enjoyed this too. Both choices had great cream content, but perhaps a tad bit too sweet. That said, I would happily get either again, a really great combo.

Once we both got our choices we had to wait over 5 minutes to pay. It was not a case of them being overcrowded, but maybe just not being efficient. I wonder if this problem arises and is worse when they are very busy. Then came the bill, over $8 for my 2 scoops and my aunt's 1 scoop. It turns out that the single scoop is only $1 less than a 2 scoop. 

When I am nearby I will most likely return, maybe to try one of their crepe creations or one of the several custom made cones or waffle bowls. They also carry a few baked goods and candies that are not made in house, the peanut butter cups were calling out to me. This shop really fits this town well, just avoid the single scoops here."

Food,2.0,OR,"This review relates to the pharmacy only. The staff here have very little discretion when it comes to discussing sensitive client information in front of store employees and other customers. The pharmacy staff use a computer across the pharmacy to check on the status of your medications when you walk in to pick up a prescription, this requires the customer to share their medical information audibly enough for the tech to hear across the pharmacy. They will ask your name, date of birth, and the medications you are picking up - so if you feel uncomfortable sharing this information loudly enough for all of the pharmacy employees, and nearby store guests and employees to hear; I would suggest using a different pharmacy. Walgreens at Clayton and Big Bend is very close and has a much more confidential pharmacy. 

I have filled my Rx here 3 times, and 2 of the 3 left me feeling very embarrassed by the pharmacy staff. The first time I had to shout my name, DOB, medications across the pharmacy. The next time the pharmacist read my medications to me from across the pharmacy as they were pulled from the bin; loudly enough for all customers in line behind to hear which medications I take. 

If your medication is out of stock they cannot switch it to a different location for pick up, or return your Rx to fill elsewhere. The only option is to wait for the new order to arrive. Last time this happened to be I went 8 days without my medication as I was waiting for CVS's new order to arrive.

I only started going to CVS because my insurance provider told me that my Rx's would be less expensive at CVS. One Rx is less than $1 cheaper and the other two cost a few dollars more than they did at Walgreens. I'm going to switch back."

Food,3.0,OR,"Jeez, what is it with bonafide grocery stores being so expensive in this town?  Gotta admit though, this Save Mart location is a step up from Raley's, which seems to be the most expensive of them all.

Open from 6 am - midnight 7 days per week, and it's in a convenient location that's close to the Motel 6 and Quality Inn.  That's about it for the pros.

For the cons:  

1. Expensive prices, even for items that are supposedly on sale.  

2. Only about two check-out lanes open, even during the most peak times of the day or night.  Seems like express lanes don't exist here.

3. Staff is a bit on the slow side.

4.  I've encountered stale bakery donuts and bread here.

5.  On every single visit, there always seems to be a scoundrel or two screwing up everyone's ride.  Yesterday, a man in the only check-out lane open attempted to purchase about $192 in groceries on a credit card, which kept repeatedly getting declined.  After literally 17 rounds of putting some groceries back and re-swiping the card, he got nowhere, finally gave up, and walked out.  He was hitting people up for money in the parking lot about two minutes later.  Two weeks ago, a lady swore up and down she hit a progressive jackpot in the little video poker parlor up front, started arguing with several staff members when they told her she didn't hit squat, and was eventually escorted out after the police were called.  All this madness going on when there's only one checkout stand open at any given time of the day or night makes for some interesting shopping, no doubt.

For that price we were served the 12 year old Doublewood, the 14 year old Caribbean Cask, and the 17 year old Doublewood. We also got a The Balvenie Tasting and Nose glass that is either Riedel or the same quality as the Riedel ones I have at home.

The US rep for Balvenie, Gemma and David Stewart, MBE the master distiller who had worked there for over 50 years provided a great history of The Balvenie were in Scotland. They gave a talk across the US via internet. You could send your questions via Twitter or Instagram as well as post your photos to win prizes. It was a fun and smart way to engage the audience. 

My favorite was the Caribbean Cask because it is so lite and smooth and also a little tropical. One thing I learned was that  5 years makes a big difference. The 17 year old Doublewood was much smoother and more luscious than the 12 year old.  I could see the 17 year old Doublewood as an after dinner drink because it paired well with the dark chocolate.

This gentleman named Anthony, approx 45 yrs old, black male, approx 5'6ish, with a beard (a lil gray on the sides) met me as I walked in & grabbed me a cart. I noticed him doing it for everybody that he came in contact with in between of everything else he was doing. He is such a bright spot amongst all the other miserable looking people working here & I probably passed about 30, it looked like it was shipment/stocking day, so there were ALOT of employees EVERYWHERE, NOT ONE even acknowledged me or any of the other customers that passed them, EXCEPT Anthony who seemed to acknowledge EVERYONE. After I checked out & was heading toward the door, there he was again helping an elderly woman & as I walked passed, he again acknowledged me & said here, Ill take that for you & began to push my cart while we had a short discussion about the weather. When we got to my vehicle, he said just open it up, Ill load it, you sit in your car & Ill take your cart back for you. He quickly loaded everything & said have a very good day, as he noticed another elderly woman near my car who was just getting to hers & he said let me get that for you. The smile, surprise & appreciation on her face brightened my day.

My husband had the chicken tenders were very sweet and I didn't too, which is not a bit bland. The chicken. I got a little shrimp and he liked the bf the tuna I liked the but was ok. I enjoyed it."
Food,3.0,OR,"Have not been to a Dunkin Donut in over a year.  Had heard good things about this new location (Stop 11 & Emerson), so decided to make a visit this morning.  The service was disappointing.  They were more concerned about the drive thru business (which was only one car) than the only customer they had standing in their lobby at 6 a.m.  - I had two separate orders this morning, after filling my first order,  I was asked if I could wait while they took care of another drive thru customer, I said yeah sure  (really?????)  My problem with this, is that when I pulled in this morning there was no one in the drive thru and I debated on driving thru or walking in, maybe if I had drove thru I would have gotten better service.  It seemed as though no one really wanted to wait on me in the lobby this morning.  Spent almost $25.00 in donuts.  After I was rang up I asked if they might have some butter available for the six muffins I purchased.  I was told the don't offer butter, but they do have butter, but would have to charge me for it.  I only needed a small amount for 2 of the 6 muffins, I said okay, fine.  I still never got the butter, even the so-called manager was too concerned about the ""ONE"" drive thru customer she had.  I am done with Dunkin Donuts and so is the other party I was picking donuts up for.  If I could give this visit less than one star I would.  I will never be back, heading back to Jacks or Longs donuts.  Bye Dunkin  - Heyyyy Dunkin, got back with orders this morning, your guys gave me chocolate and NOT blueberry....Thanks for wasting my money!!"
Food,5.0,CG,"My boyfriend and I are here on the weekend and decided to stop by for a drink. We ordered a 6 pack of the Cherry, Strawberry and Chocolate, and the Cherry. The Cherry was amazing and had a great flavor. We will definitely be back! I highly recommend the Strawberry!This is a very clean store. I go here almost every weekend and it is a clean store. They have a great selection of beer and wine. They have a great selection of wine and beer. They have a lot of fresh produce and they have a lot of other items. I love the fact that they have a lot of organic options that are organic. The only downside is that it is on the lower end of the store. I don't know if it is the only store I've ever seen that has a variety of products, but I have no idea of how much of a selection of non organic items would be. I have seen some of the best meat in the area. I always find something on the shelves that I don't see in other grocery stores. I go here to get some of my own food for Christmas. They have a lot of stuff.This is the only place for me! 




I'm not a regular farmers market for the biggest and I'm a small market for the most of all of convenience.

Food,4.5,OR,"What a way of walking into a place without knowing it would be a celebration of all things ""going back to normal.""  I had made plans to see a movie with a friend and had suggested going to Engine 8, to grab a drink prior as this has been on my list for way to long to check out.

I was hoping to sit outside but since it was an unexpected rainy, chilly day we went inside. Not fully sure if we need to check-in, or seat ourselves one of the servers let us know that it's open seating.  My friend pointed to her masks (as we were the only ones wearing them) and the lady shook her head saying they're not required.

We had the sweetest server, I wish I had taken her name down.  But she provided very attentive kind service.  She told us this is the busiest that it's been and that for sure was evident!

They had live music, people were dancing, the back room had a private party going on , and I don't believe there was a single table empty!

I tried the white wine 4 glass tasting.  I thought it was an awesome way of sampling so many different wines.

I ordered the combination personal pizza which was enough for 2 to eat.

I was ready to order the Blackberry wine to go but was told it was sold out and being made as we speak, so I ended up taking home some macaroons which were delicious.

I have on my to-dos to place an order of the Blackberry wine, as well as order some of their desserts as they sounded amazing.

The only thing I wish was that there was the fruit wine that was a tasting option, (that way I know which other bottles to buy).  I plan to be back so I can enjoy the pretty outside patio especially come the warmer weather."
Food,4.5,CG,"Dairy Palace was my favorite ice cream shop ever! We've been going to this place since they opened and we have had a lot of ice cream and have enjoyed every flavor of it! We had the strawberry shortcake and the chocolate chip. They are all very good! They also have a great variety of flavors to choose from! We will definitely be back!I was so excited to see a cute little spot with a decent selection of fresh flowers and some cool specialty items. The store was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I'm not a huge fan of the prices but I think it's worth it. The flowers are very reasonably priced and the flowers are very fresh. The store was clean and the employees were very friendly.

Food,4.5,OR,"We had a case of the good the bad and the ugly here. Also big note: they close at 9:30 not 10 as posted. We arrived near 9:15 and while it's good to have fresh donuts daily, it's bad when they are pretty much sold out and you don't have a good selection. Disappointing to kids that want a donut anyway. Best donut was the vanilla glazed and it was very good. They call these the 1000 layer  - I'm not sure they have a 1000 but it is a layered dough. The chocolate salted had a cream filling that caught us off guard and while good had salt added which in my group just didn't ""go"". I do love salted everything so it's not that. They used a large course salt that actually crunched in your teeth - and that was a hard pass as you thought your tooth was exploding when you first bit down. A second puff style has ALOT of salt and the outside was inedible. Forgive me the names but it was cross shaped like a breakfast pastry. The orange roll was very good. Then the least favorite was the chocolate cake style donuts. They look very different from the 1000 layer, in hind sight they may have been gluten free. Neat flavor combos that appealed to kids like s'mores but didn't deliver on taste. They sell ice cream but you are only allowed to get it on top of a donut due to competition in the area...also a bummer as we wanted a scoop but not on a donut really. Oh they were also out of bowls which confounded the donut/ice cream problem and out of coffee... . I would have given them a 2 if the vanilla gazed wasn't good. Hubs tried the 1000 layer orangesicle donut and he liked it. They probably make more good donuts, we just didn't get to try them."
Food,3.0,CG,"I have been to this location a couple of times and I will say that the service is pretty good.  The drinks are always fresh and the staff is very friendly.  I would definitely go again.

Food,4.5,OR,"I grew up in and around Philly my whole life, so I'm accustomed to a couple of local places, Rita's included. I've driven by Capri many times, but I never stopped by, and I was curious after reading the rave reviews. Capri recently re-opened for take out this past weekend, and I stopped by Saturday afternoon to try some of their flavors. The location is right off of Route 30, so drive slow or you might miss it. It's a cash only establishment, something they may want to consider re-thinking, given the current circumstances. Some cash-only places are starting to accept Venmo out of safety of all parties involved. 

I read a lot about the Cherry Bordeaux, so I ordered a quart of that, along with the Mango and Lemon Peel. A young sales person stood outside with a table to accept orders and take payment, and the orders were being given to the employees inside. I retrieved the three quarts quickly and seamlessly, and I was on my way! I sampled the three flavors at home, and I really enjoyed the consistency. It's not too icy and it's a little creamier than your typical water ice. As far as the flavors go, the lemon peel had a minty after taste and it was perfectly tart. The mango flavor was surprisingly (in a good way) tart as well. I know that previous reviewers raved about the cherry bordeaux, but the general consensus for my family/friends was that it was their least favorite. I was so disappointed, because yes, they do have chunks of real black cherry, which was fantastic, but I dislike cherry water ice that just tastes like grenadine slush. If you enjoy cherry water ice that just tastes like sugar syrup, this might be for you, but I was hoping for a sweet and tangy cherry flavor. I may be back later on in the summer to try their other flavors."
Food,4.5,CG,"When I read that Aldi had an Aldi on the east side of my house, I decided to go and check it out. The store is small, but clean. The employees are nice and helpful. The only thing I wish they would improve was the layout. I ordered a lot of things and they didn't have the most of them. I ordered a large bag of bread pudding. I got a small bag of butter pudding and it was too much for me. I got a small bag of cookies and cream. The cream was too much, which I was disappointed. I was looking for a nice little bread pudding, but they didn't have any. I'm not sure if they had some other items or if I was just looking for something to eat. I like how it is open 24/7. I'll definitely be back for the baked goods.This place is soooo cute!  It's not really the cheapest in town.

Food,2.5,OR,"For the most part, I think this target location is a decent store, but it does have some issues.  The most glaring and frustrating problem is that they eliminated the guest services area and replaced it with a Starbucks. They took one of the regular checkout lanes and converted it to guest services/10 items or less checkout- which is a TERRIBLE idea! I hardly think it's fair to stand in line for 10 minutes while other customers are making purchases and I just have to make a return. This is really quite frustrating and I would like them to remedy this ill-conceived idea and have a dedicated guest services line only.  

Over the past year or so I've also noticed that the level of customer service has gone down which is always unfortunate. And as Target seems to pride itself on providing excellent customer service, they should make sure that the people they hire for the local stores are indeed striving to meet that goal.  With the customer service aspect, it's really hit or miss at this location.  Mostly, it's a positive interaction.  However, there have been a few times when I've had to deal with one particular lady that's verging on hostile and is not exactly friendly.   If she's treating one person poorly then I'm sure there are others.  

Selection-wise the store does about average. However, I have found an entire shelf of very much expired coconut water bottles that should have been pulled MONTHS ago.  I brought this to the attention of an employee stocking shelves who assured me it would be taken care of; and yet several months later I find the same coconut waters expired on the shelves again!  That is sloppy and acceptable.  

I'm glad that the store is so close to where I live, but would really like to see them work on these customer service issues."
Food,4.5,CG,"I have been watching to go to the market and try all the produce that is in the store. I always have the best experience, but I have to say, the produce is not that great. I have been in the produce section for about 15 years and always notice the produce being fresher than the bottom of the bag. I have had to wait 30 minutes for the check-in line to be filled with people waiting for their check-in order. It's very frustrating. I do have to say that I have been shopping at this store since it was first opened. This store is super busy and the employees are really friendly. However, the produce is not as good as the vegetables I buy. I usually buy my produce from the Publix on Charlotte Pike, but at this store they have a lot of organic produce. I would have given this store 5 stars if I could. I always get the ""tender"" latte with honey, and the sugar is always on point.

Food,4.0,OR,"This is a must-experience ice cream shop if you come to Tampa!  Unless of course you're tired of having the usual liquid nitrogen desserts and deep freeze ice cream rolls.

This place is awesome and gets 5 stars for creativity, entertainment, and tasty desserts all rolled into an ice cream outing. 

We came here after having great fresh southern shrimp next door at Shrimp and Co.
The staff at Snobachi were very nice and friendly and even gave a veteran/military discount.  I didn't even ask, they just asked at checkout. 
Their ice cream rolls are created before your eyes on a deep freeze stainless griddle.  You can get various sauces, syrups, and toppings for your ice cream roll.  It was really cool to watch them make it.  As the name of their establishment implies, they are the ice cream-equivalents to the Japanese Teppanyaki/HIbachi chefs.

A really cool dessert they have is the Dragon's Breath. The ingredients include sweet dessert dippers and Liquid Nitrogen.  Yes Liquid Nitrogen.  It is inverse fondue where you dip your dessert in liquid N.  Then fog comes out of your mouth and nostrils!  very fun!  

Snobachi is in Ybor City, which is a historical part of Tampa and is very nice.  You can even plan your trip out here on the Trolley (Teco Street Car).  The prices are very reasonable for what you get and the entertainment.

This place reminds us of our unique dining  experiences in Portland Oregon (Voodoo Donuts, Rimsky-Korsakov Coffee house).  Very fun!

I heard it can get busy and the staff indicated you can place your order ahead of time. By luck, We went in when it was raining and no one was there.  However, I sense it can be really busy as it is popular.  So check out their web page and call to see how busy it is.  It is worth checking out."

Food,2.0,OR,"I'm actually writing this review because the barista I encountered here tonight was very friendly but unfortunately that has not always been the case. There are a lot of people out there who refuse to go to Starbucks for so many reasons nowadays, but alas, here I am at Starbucks. When I have time to go to local coffee shops I will, but when I don't have time, this is the closest thing on my way to work that has a drive-thru. I was so excited to finally see a full Starbucks store on the south end of town. Unfortunately a few of the first times I went here I was greeted by many rude baristas and it was usually in the morning or afternoon. Rude meaning, never smiling, never greeting you (upon entrance or departure), and on a couple of occasions I've even heard them speaking poorly about their customers (myself included) and criticized what people order. If a barista from this store is looking at this review, really? How awful of a person are you if you are literally speaking badly about a customer as they're standing at the bar right in front of you? I'm sorry if the baristas here get bored of making the classics over and over again, but sometimes they are the first people a customer sees when their day starts, so the least they could do is show good customer service. The reason I bumped the stars up on this review is because recently others have started working here and the atmosphere has changed. The baristas that work here now are friendly and helpful. This location in particular has WiFi, outdoor seating, and a nice indoor area full of open space. Side note though, every time I have sat inside I've been greeted by a dirty table no matter what time of the day it is. It doesn't take that long to wipe down the tables for your customers."

Food,4.5,OR,"I was excited to stop here seeing all of the good reviews they had.  Unfortunately, I had a bad experience all around.  I walk in and the guy behind the counter didn't even acknowledge me.  It was at 2pm and it was dead, so it's not as if he had anything to do.  The guy was extremely rude and didn't even seem to want to be there.  I am newer to the area and had never really had many of the beers. First off, I asked to sample two beers before deciding to purchase one, and he had an attitude.  Then I told him I saw on Yelp that they were offering a free growler with fill purchase.  I got attitude again and he told me it was only valid on Mondays but he would honor it.  Well, if it's only valid on Mondays, Yelp should state that then and don't take it out on the customer for not knowing.   I am extremely familiar with west coast IPAs and asked if he could recommend an IPA in general since I hadn't had many of them locally.  I told him I would try the 1st one he recommended.  It was good and said I would get a growler of it.  He rung it up and said my total was $22.95.  Yup.  He recommended one of the most expensive beers and never mentioned how much it would cost until he rung it up.  Buyer beware.  Know how much before you buy if you're on a budget.  Long story short, the guy was extremely rude and recommended a really expensive beer without warning me.  I won't be back.  Since being here, I've already tried Tailgate as well as Homegrown Taproom, and I would highly recommend either of the two places over this.  Both had friendly employees and great beer!"

Food,4.0,OR,"I love coming here on Wednesdays because that's when their sale ads overlap. I enjoy their produce, nice selection of healthy breads, and their meat when it's on sale. Can't beat three for a dollar on avocados. 

It makes me very happy to see a store like this on the IL side of the river. Sadly even though they stock a lot of the same brands as Whole Foods, I still find myself wishing they had more of what I'm looking for (at reasonable prices). I really wish they had the big gallons of Suja green juice. They only have the mini single serving ones. Blah. Fortunately after a few trips in, I did find a different option inside their store for a chlorella/spirullina morning green juice. I would still be in there buying the big Suja gallons if they had them. Sigh. 

They're good for some things and not great for others. For instance, you don't want to come here for ricotta cheese. You'll pay three times as much as Walmart for the same brand. I try to just get items on sale here. 

It's frustrating that they are commonly out of standard things I'll happen to run in for. For instance tonight I was on a mission to make tacos but they didn't have any ground beef out that wasn't frozen. They had ONE package of ground pork but it didn't look great so I passed on it and got some shrimp from the seafood deli. This isn't the typical case but today they just didn't have the stock available for me to get what I came in for. That's always disappointing. 

In response to Hannah's review stating that she found maggots in her trail mix... SO DID I! I found what I believe was a weevil in my probiotic trail mix that was on sale. I got a refund the next time I went in though. All I had to do was ask someone about it."

Food,4.5,OR,"Definitely one of my favorite places in Chinatown, and so conveniently located across the street from the supermarket that I almost always stop in for pastries after I make a Chinese grocery run.

My personal favorites are the cocktail buns and the pineapple buns, which are always fresh and have a good ratio of bun to adornment.  But, I've sampled almost every kind of pastry here and found that they're generally the right texture and consistency, and very fresh.  The one thing I've been sort of skeeved out by is the pre-made banh mi; I'm not sure it would be very good.

Now I'm turning on my Hong Kong-nese pastry snob/know-it-all mode, so feel free to skip this paragraph if you don't want to hear it: the only pastry that isn't up to par with a Chinatown competitor is the egg custard tart. Egg custard filling is easy -- hell, my lily white significant other made perfect filling his very first time attempting egg custard tarts; the real measure of a good egg custard tart is how well the crust is done.  Here, the crust of the tart is too flour-y and not particularly flaky, the way good egg custard tart crust should be.  I haven't done all of the Philadelphia Chinatown bakeries, but Hong Kong Bakery is the only one of the four or five that I've tried that has a decent crust. I grew up eating egg custard tarts, see, once a week every week until I was at least 10; plus I've lived in Hong Kong and probably had one every day while I lived there. 

As other people have noted extensively, Bread Top House also has real fruit smoothies. You can ask for the fruit ""bubble teas"" without boba and it will be 50 cents less. It's not the ABSOLUTE cheapest place in Chinatown, but it's still cheap and the cheaper places all use powder, yuck. I love Bread Top House's mango fruit smoothie!"

Food,3.0,OR,"This Target is so disappointing. I totally get that it's not meant to be your average Target, but I do think that whatever its function is, it should do it well, and it doesn't. The selection on everything but food is very slim, and the prices for most things are several dollars more than they are online or in the South Philly Target. I think that's unfair. I've come here needing a lot of common things that it doesn't even have. A mop? Nope, they don't sell mops. Not one mop. Lysol? Ok, they had one kind of Lysol and it was $6.29. Who spends $6 on Lysol?? Infant formula? Always out, and when in stock they only carry small containers. Anyone who knows anything about babies knows that buying infant formula in small containers is pointless. Not to mention that it is $2 more here than in other stores. I don't understand their logic with a huge area dedicated to sports team apparel that you can buy at 10 places in close proximity, and taking up space with a Starbucks when there are 3 other Starbucks within two blocks. Also, I thought one of the points of this store was to be able to order online and pickup here. However, this location is never available when I've tried to order online. The whole thing just seems ridiculous when there are many CVS, Rite Aids and Walgreens around where you can get the same items for the inflated prices (or less). The only thing that sets it apart is the food selection. Lastly, it is painfully small. Everyone is bumping into each other, carts of inventory are constantly blocking aisles; it is just not a pleasant shopping experience. I have no desire to spend time and browse, which I think it one of the ideas that makes Target great in the first place. You go in needing a few things and come out spending $120 on cute, useless stuff. Not happening here."

The fruit and veggies are so fresh and delicious. The produce is also fresh and tasty. The prices are great. They have everything from fresh cut veggies, organic fruits, frozen veggies, to organic produce. I love the name and the variety of fruits and vegetables. There's something for everyone here.

Food,4.5,OR,"Like most brewery tours, distillery tours tend to not be very distinctive. For the most part, if you've seen one, you've seem 'em all. What set this distillery tour apart for me was the quality of our tour guide, a salty, entertaining older gentleman whose name I sadly do not recall. Sure, we toured all the barrels, pipes, and vats that are essential to the distillation and maturation processes, but what made this tour much more fun than most were all the colorful stories and little bits of history that our guide would pepper in among his explanations of the more prosaic aspects of a distillery. 

And then, of course, there was the sampling. Our welcome cocktail was a simple, but effective combination of their spiced rum, and sweet tea. I don't usually think of rum and tea as going together, but here the combo was addictively refreshing. I think this has more to do with the unique cayenne/cinnamon/ginger/clove spicing going on in Old New Orleans' very tasty spiced rum....dumping some Bacardi into a jug of sweet tea would not fare as well. 

After the tour, we tasted all the rums on offer, by themselves. They are obviously outstanding rums for cocktails, but they are also smooth enough as to be sipping rums, should one be so inclined. This distillery also makes a product called Gingeroo. This is a bottled rum cocktail with ginger juice, cayenne, and cane syrup - a definite must for anyone who loves a good ginger bite as much as I. 

Service is exceptional as well. I wanted to bring a few bottles home, but had no room in our luggage. No problem - I was able to purchase 2 bottles of the spiced rum, plus a bottle of the Gingeroo, and they shipped the bottles to my office in Miami. Shortly after returning home, I was enjoying Old New Orleans' spiced rum in my own cocktail creations. Highly recommended for visitors of the Crescent City and locals alike."

Food,3.5,OR,"On Tuesday 8/9/16 I purchased a bottle of Jameson whiskey and Bulleit Bourbon for a gathering I planned that night. The gathering didn't happen and I no longer needed the liquor. That night, I went to Schunucks on Lindell to return these two unopened bottles. While initially willing to do the return, the cashier said she couldn't because ""Culinaria is different than Schnucks."" 

The next day I went to this establishment to make the return. The manager on duty Margie Torrillo told me it was against the law to return alcohol and the store could lose their liquor license. I left and went to check the Missouri liquor laws for myself - statute 311.333. 1 states ""wholesalers may accept the return intoxicating liquor containing alcohol in excess of five percent."" 

I then returned to the location, the store clerk there too said it was against the law for her to accept the return, I presented her the law. She stressed the ""may"" in the statement and that ""some people"" fill up the bottles with water and seal them back up. I didn't respond. 

She called Margie back down. Margie then said it was against Schnucks policy to return liquor. I mentioned the law to her and the Lindell location being willing to do a return but couldn't because of the location. She said there was nothing she could do. Security was next to me at this point. I left with my friend who called the Schnucks location on Grand and Gravois and asked if he could return the liquor to their store. They said it would not be a problem as long as we had a receipt. When we got to the store, the cashier had to call down a manager to approve it. Eventually we were given a full refund. 

I was clearly lied to twice about company policy and I will never shop at this location again. And I will be encouraging others, specifically people of color, to take their business elsewhere."

Food,3.5,OR,"I go to Bashas quite frequently. I like the meat selection, love their crusty bread. Let me tell you what disappointed me so much it made me rethink my loyalty. I went to pick up a rotisserie chicken, to complete our meal. When I am at the checkout the lady that was paying before me had forgotten her Bashas cars and the young lady serving as cashier politely asked her if she had a Bashas card and proceeded to enter her phone number. I always do the same and the cashier always asks. When my turn to checkout came she rang up my groceries and scanned a card that was lying on the register. I informed her that I had not given my phone number and she just replied "" oh I already swiped a card for you. I told her I would rather have it on my own card and she reluctantly voided the transaction and did a new one putting my Bashas card. I asked her why would she do that without asking and she responded it was just a habit. I called the manager ( or at least the person said he was the manager ) I retold the whole story and after he explained all the discount and coupon benefits of having a card all he had to say was that 50% of the people didn't care. He did not say he would discuss this or apologized. Had I been asked first and said I didn't care or that I had no card ok. To assume and do it seconds after having given the prior client the choice made me feel very uncomfortable. She may have thought that I didn't speak English   The other question is who's card was swiped? The cashier's? Does it belong to the store?

Food,2.5,OR,"One star is literally being generous. This review is for the pharmacy...

I went in to have a prescription filled this evening actually. When I walked up I was greeted by a woman. I had explained we've never had a prescription filled there before as we are new to town. Gave her our insurance card along with the note from the doctor and she "" hmmm... I don't know.... hmmmm.... I just don't know...."" for a good 3 minutes. No exaggeration!!! She looks at the paper and the card and then around over and over. Till I finally ask is everything ok? She then proceeds to tell me she's not sure what to do with it... and says again quotes ""you know what here's what you can do... call your insurance and get this information for me"" I asked but isn't that what you do? I've never done that before for a pharmacist. She looks up and me and then looks around and says ""well we are actually really busy with all the people here""  (there were 2 people picking up a prescription together on the other end. No one else was there) I straight up said for whom? There's no one here besides the 2 people picking up there stuff. She had no answer... so I said no. I am going to take this down the road to someone who actually does their job. 

Horrible horrible customer service here and now that I think of it i went once before to the pharmacy to get help picking a cold n cough med for my toddler. The pharmacist literally read the label to me of one medicine I asked about. At the end says to consult a doctor. As the label says. I asked if he was and he said yes but talk to your doctor. Guess it starts from the top.

Food,4.0,OR,"We'd say this is more like a Public Market (a la Seattle's Pike Place Market which was my second ""home"" while in college) than a Farmers Market. But that would be splitting hairs and by whatever name this is a great place. 

In Trenton. Who knew? Fortunately for us, the answer to that question is friends of ours did and we visited the market with them two weeks ago. We found.. 

... several vendors with lovely seasonal produce like beautiful peppers of all kinds and late Jersey tomatoes and apples
...a couple of bakers specializing in pie 
...a sweets candy shop run by Amish vendors  that seemed to specialize in things needed for baking 
...a Polish meats vendor 
...a winery with tasting table set up. 

To name but a few of the many options. But our two favorite vendors were these: 

1) VITELLO & SONS Italian deli serving up sandwiches, deli items, and a couple of wonderful, fresh seasonal salads. We chose the yummy fresh fig and sweet potato gnocchi salad to take along with sandwiches on a picnic in Buck's County afterward. (BIG sandwiches...plan to split one.) The other salad option on the day of our visit was one that contained fresh apples and fennel and looked great too. Vitello's also has some packaged items, like pastas, and an array of fresh frozen ravioli's and home made sauces. There were obviously a number of regulars coming in and some were asking about ""next week's stuffed artichokes"".  Made us wish we could have returned the next week ourselves!

2) The cheese vendor (just a couple of stalls down from Vitello's) and the name of which I did not note was offering a broad array of great looking (and smelling) cheeses. And as wonderful surprise, she had burrata! For only $10 each!! Unbelievable!!! The burrata was great as part of our dinner the next day. 

As for logistics, we were there on a Saturday and it was crowded, but the big parking lot provided ample spaces to park."

I came here for the first time today and was quite disappointed with the service. The gentleman working was very rude and didn't speak very well about his customers. I'm not sure if he was just annoyed or just annoyed or just didn't care or it was just a bad experience.

I asked him if he was just there and he didn't know how to say it was. He said he was just standing there and didn't know. I asked him if he was there and he was there. He was in the manager. I told me if he just walked out front and he was there and I told him that he was in the manager and he was on the manager. I left. He walked away.

Food,4.0,OR,"3 stars. As someone who goes without eating two or three meals daily JUST to enjoy caramel apples & milk chocolate, this chain chocolatier did not measure up. I wanted it to, but it did not. The shoppe's aestetics & location are very nice, but the taste & quality of its products are not up to par...unless I'm in a chocolate pinch. 

I did not try the ice-cream. Instead, I bought a Sea Salt Chocolate Caramel Apple @ $8.99. Neither the Caramel nor the chocolate are rich in taste; neither come even close to that of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory apples. The milk chocolates @ $33.99 lb are more expensive & again not rich (enough) in flavor or texture. 

I bought fudge (to bring home to freeze as I often do for future company); it was $10.99 per pound, yet on special @ buy two slabs & get one free. I didn't taste the fudge until I arrived home, which was my mistake. The fudge is OK, but not great. It is NOT sweet creamy chocolate. Also, LOOK @ THE PIC to see what returned home w/ me after the staffer placed my box of fudge vertically in a paper bag-- it's a mess & unpresentable to anyone but me. (It was NOT left in the heat; the chocolate variety was obviously too soft to be sold.)

The young employee who waited on me was very friendly. I'll assume he's a rather new hire due to his treatment of my bagged fudge. The three star (average rating) does not reflect on him; regardless of the squished, messy fudge, had the chocolates (& caramel) been of high quality & taste, the star rating would have been a 4 or 5.

Should you desire rich, delicious chocolates in St. Pete, head over to Schakolad on Central Ave. And I hear that Paciugo down the street has excellent Gelato. As the granddaughter of a 1901 culinary genius who perfected sugary confections over his 95 years on Earth, I'm simply unimpressed w/ this chocolatier."

I squeezed in Rite Aid during a busy schedule today thinking I'll get fast service as usual.  Unfortunately my 5 minute visit took 30 minutes and I still didn't get my medication.  

The two women in the pharmacy today did not seem to want to talk to anybody.  Even to each other.  I go in with nobody in line.  I was ignored by the pharmacist for 3 minutes and then by her coworker for 2 more.  I finally am able to ask for my medication and they take my insurance card.  Then I wait, wait, wait.  I see another customer walk up and get ignored as well.  She has to talk to the pharmacist directly over the clear barrier to get service.  Amazing.  I go back to the consultation window to see what they're doing with my order.  Both of them are working on other people's orders.  They finally see me and that's when they decide to tell me that my insurance card isn't working.  Wow.  How long would I have been waiting if I had not decided to walk up to the window when I did?  I also work in a pharmacy and no matter how busy it is, it's unacceptable to make a customer wait so long for such a small issue.  When I told them I wanted to just go, the pharmacist had the nerve to try to sell me a prescription plan that would get me my medication for twice the amount I usually pay for it.  Really?  No thanks.

Food,1.5,OR,"Absolutely horrible, the worst Dunkin I've ever tried to go to (multiple times). First off, they used to be a combo of Baskin Robbins AND Dunkin. Not too ambitious right? Many chains pull off the combo easily, NOT this place apparently...I went THREE times for a freaking milkshake across a month's time and THREE time I was told their milkshake maker was broken. You've had a whole month and can't fix or buy a new milkshake maker? It's literally listed on your menu, I waited in a stupid car line for 20 minutes just for you to tell you can't make one? Imbeciles work there, although I'm sure a few nice people too, but overall uneducated, getting orders wrong constantly with completely ineffective management. Another time when I went for a milkshake they said they didn't have the flavor which was literally advertised on their sign, mint chocolate chip. I went back more times and they never had it. You run (*ran) and ice cream shop for months and patrons can't even get the milkshake CLEARLY DISPLAYED on your sign!??? 

And finally today, which prompted this horrible review, they said their credit machine was down yesterday morning when I went. I called (thankfully) a full 24 hours later, and the credit card reader is still down. No offense to people who use cash, but I typically don't even carry any on me. This is freaking 2017 people, it's called IT and clearly shows the mismanagement over there for not clearing up the issue promptly. This place should be shut down and condemned or given a clean sweep of management from the top down and rehire a competent staff. Read the other reviews, I'm not exaggerating in the least that this is the worst Dunkin Donuts I've ever had to the deal, magnified by the fact that it's the only one around servicing our small quaint town of Pennsburg.

Unfortunately, tonight was a very different story, I placed my order and after an hour without it being delivered called to get an update and was told that my order, which included a diary product, had been sent out with 5 other orders, yet mine didn't make the ""priority deliveries"" , the employee said the orders closest were the priority ones.....when I'm a 3 minute drive or a 20 minute walk from my apartment. After the phone call I was assured that it'd be a 15 minute wait until my food was finally arriving, and over 30 minutes after that I called to cancel, and the lady on the phone had an incredibly big attitude, I ended the phone by saying thank you to her since she canceled my order and she had the audacity to say ""mhm"" she did not ask why I was canceling and didnt even mention that they had already been sent out for delivery at least 45 minutes prior to my cancellation as the previous employee did. To sum this up, I will never order any of their cold/diary products if I ever order from this place again, I had always tipped my delivery person and had always been the up most respectful to every employee here, even when everything unfolded tonight so to be treated so poorly, lied to, and obviously not cared about as a once obsessed customer, I'll definitely be taking my money and business elsewhere.

Food,3.0,OR,"We needed replacement tires for one of our cars and decided we would try BJ's Wholesale Club's tire service center on Waters Avenue in Tampa. It was a Saturday so we assumed they would be booked up or we would have to wait for hours to get in, but when we called the store they were able to get us in a few hours later. When we arrived they were able to take care of us right away and gave us an estimated time of when the car would be ready (about one hour), so we had time to walk around the store while we waited. The staff members were very friendly and were happy to answer all the questions we had.

Since this visit was during the pandemic, I was interested in seeing how they would handle the safety measures. There were plexiglass sheets installed between staff members and customers by the counter, and interaction between staff and customers was limited. Seats in the waiting area were separated to encourage social distancing, and masks were required of guests (and worn by staff members). The only thing that might have been nice (but I didn't think of until we left) would be if they sprayed the guests' car keys and parts of the car they touched (door handles, steering wheel, etc.) with Lysol as an extra safety measure - but I am not sure if any tire shops take that step. 

You cannot get to the tire center from inside the store, and the entrance is around the side of the building. If you go shopping while waiting (like we did) you will either have to take your cart all the way around the building to the tire center or have someone you are with drive the car over to the store entrance to meet you. Since it was pouring rain when we were leaving my husband drove the car over - but if you are there alone you may want to keep this in mind (especially in the summer when it rains daily)."

I like the traditional popsicle flavors, but I think the popsicles are too sweet for me.  I'm not sure if I would go back, but I would definitely come back for more flavors!I was looking for a place to get a cake for my daughter's birthday and I found this place. I was so excited to see the new bakery here. I went in to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday and it was absolutely delicious. I tried the red velvet cake and the chocolate cake. I love the chocolate cake and the chocolate cake. I thought the white chocolate raspberry was the best I have ever had and the red velvet cake was the best cake I have ever had. The icing was so moist and delicious! My daughter loved it and the strawberry cheesecake was a little piece was so good. The cake was moist and flakey and moist and delicious.

Food,3.5,OR,"2 and a half stars, four for a Target.  This is one of the cleaner Target stores that you'll visit.  The produce here is pretty good, not as good as the competing Meijer in the next plaza over, but good enough.  There is a Starbucks, Target optical, photo studio, and snack cafe.  There is also a pharmacy, deli, and bakery, but these are second rate compared to Meijer and don't compare to Marsh's standards.  This store has a great selection of DVDs and CD's (however much longer those will be around) and their electronics are decent.  All of their other non-grocery is made in China and is cheap third rate stuff, especially textiles.  

I don't trust their meat selection as is a general rule with most larger stores like this as it tends to spoil quickly.  Archer Farms milk also is not very good either.  They do carry a decent selection of juices and such, but selection of dairy was limited to a few national brands as seems to be the trend in these bigger box stores.  Marsh and Kroger have a much better selection of dairy items from local producers.

Prices here have improved dramatically over the recent years.  When Super Target's first moved into Indianapolis, people complained about their pricing and at one point, Target's grocery brands were in trouble.  But with strategic pricing and carrying a lot of niche products in their grocery area, they seemed to have made headway.

In particular, their frozen food and enormous grocery selection is what makes this store worth trying to find those difficult to find specialty items and brands not normally carried by Midwest grocers.  Granted their are other stores that carry specialty items, but you usually pay premium price at smaller stores like Trader Joe's or Fresh Market or even Safeway.

All in all, you could do all your shopping here, but it is better to stick to frozen and specialty items otherwise you could spend hours gawking at everything else they have."
Food,2.5,CG,"In this state, retailers like this need to be more careful with their inventory, especially in the store.

I had a coupon for a free mini-mart gift card, and it was worth it.  It was a free gift card for my mom and me to buy a full sized box of 2 mini-scoops, which were $5 each.  I also got a free mini-scoop cookie for my dad.  I thought that was very good.  

The young lady who helped me was really nice and helpful.  She was very patient and went above and beyond.  She was very helpful and kind.  She was very accommodating, and I felt safe and well taken care of.  She was truly a pleasure to work with and I will be back!This is a very cool place with good drinks. There are a few tables outside, but not a lot of seating. I got a mocha and a mocha. The espresso was very good. The atmosphere was very welcoming. The staff was friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable. I would definitely come back here again.This is the only place for bubble tea lovers of tea lovers, but if you are not on the foodie lovers.

Food,2.5,OR,"Yelp reviews for B-21 are all over the place, with some people really loving this company, and others really disliking it.   Personally, my experience with B-21 was good from start to finish.

My partner and I really enjoy a particular cabernet sauvignon that we'd been able to find at our local Total Wine.  We were fans of the 2015 vintage, then a few months ago that company sold us some bottles of 2016 as a substitute and it wasn't as good. Most recently we noticed all their stores in our area either had very limited quantities, or were out completely.  I did an internet search and found that B-21 had the wine we liked, the 2015 vintage we preferred, and they had it for something like $12/bottle cheaper than our local supermarket offered it for when they still carried it. As a bonus, B-21 offered free shipping.

We ordered 12 bottles and received confirmation right away.  The only oddity was that the invoice said our bottles wouldn't ship for more than another week.  I guess if you need your order quickly, this company may not always be able to accommodate.  True to their word, on the day my order was supposed to ship I received notification that our wine was sent via FedEx, and it arrived early the next afternoon.  It was well packed, arriving to us in a box of molded trays, 3 bottles per tray, stacked 4 trays high, with the bottles laying on their sides.

Since I saw some comments here on Yelp about wines from B-21 sometimes tasting off, or possibly being improperly stored or overheating during shipping, we opened a bottle and it seemed to taste as it should.  Overall I was happy with B-21.  Again, it was a bit odd that our wine wasn't shipped for more than a week after ordering, but once it was sent I received it in less than a day via FedEx, our order was as we expected, prices were very reasonable and the quality was good."
Food,3.0,CG,"Not my favorite Target, but this location is the best. I will always make a special trip to this Target. I had a great experience at this location! The customer service was very friendly and helpful. I ordered a flight of 4 beer pours for $6. 50. The staff was very helpful. I ended up choosing the Bud Light and the Pale Ale. I wish I could have sampled all the beers! I highly recommend this place. I love this place! I love their cakes and cakes! My favorite is the strawberry cake, but the carrot cake is my favorite! Their red velvet cake is also a must try. They also have a lot of vegan options! I love their cookies and cakes! They're a bit pricey but they're delicious and worth it! I'll be back!Went here for the first time today and was impressed with the service. We ordered two drinks, both were delicious. The lady taking orders was very friendly and the drinks were really good. We'll be back soon!I went to this Starbucks location for the first time after visiting this location in the west philly area. I would have not been to have never been in the first thing but they have had a problem with the first chance to go back in the first time. it was a lot of my brother had to order was an order, 

after we had no problem with a problem. and I had a half off 

but I had a slow, 
that they gave my husband had to be the wrong order. and the orders. I had a little and didn't a bad."
Food,4.5,OR,"I visited your shop today with my boyfriend who needed more vape juice and I never object because although I don't vape I adore the atmosphere, but mostly the crunch berry cryochino. 

While the gentleman assisted my boyfriend I was instead ignored by the lady behind the counter-I have served before so I get it. You had 2 customers sitting at the bar. After I stood for a minute the gentleman who was helping my boyfriend from the other side of the room finish their transaction, came over to me, took my order and made my drink. 

Here comes the complaint-and mind you I don't even send my food back at restaurants because I don't want to be ""that person"". 

Instead, two gentleman at the bar and the one behind started talking about oriental people, their ""50 cent wage"" and it just went downhill from there. It even went as far as referring to Asian people (Koreans) as ""gooks"". Luckily for all of them, I didn't hear the last part as I was preoccupied with something else until my boyfriend informed me as we drove off. 

It was perfectly okay I'm assuming to them because one of them was white, African American, and Puerto Rican. It must be fine make racist comments when you ASSUME none of them are around. 

Plot twist: 

UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM THERE IS A HALF JAPANESE WOMAN AT THE SAME GODDAMN BAR 
RIGHT
NEXT 
TO
THEM.
 
It is 2018. Leave that racist shit at home. My boyfriend did you all a favor by not telling me that last tidbit because I would have embarrassed everyone there with my reveal and my drink would have gone flying. This is NEVER acceptable and I'm so disappointed in a place that I have referred all kinds of people to over the past 3 years we have been customers. 

I would say ""sadly"", but I'm not sad about not coming back. I would much rather give my business to an establishment that doesn't sit there and insult me to my face because they don't realize I am mixed."
Food,3.5,CG,"We came here on a weekend afternoon and the line was out the door! The guy working the front was so nice and the place was clean and inviting! We got the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was delicious! I would definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!I love love this place. They have the most delicious ice cream in the area. I've had the cheesecake ice cream, and I love the salted caramel. I like that they have a ton of flavors to choose from, and the staff is friendly. I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but I've found some of the flavors to be a little too sweet. I'd recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough, and the salted caramel. It's a cute little shop and I'll be back!Went to this location today with my boyfriend.  We decided to go to the Starbucks on the other side of the street.   I asked the woman at the counter for a price of $5.  She had no idea what price she wanted and asked me to buy it.  I told her that I was not allowed to buy the same price as a different size.   I told her.  I explained that she explained that I had a different price.  I told her that the price,  she had to pay for $3.  to return it.  She then gave me a $5.  She handed me a $5.  I told me $3.  I explained that I gave me $5.  I said ""get $5.  $5.  I told her $5.  I asked what I told her $5.  She then told her $"
Food,5.0,OR,"I wish this place was closer.  This is one of the most awesomeness ice spots.  Their ice cream is heavenly. They combine two of my favorite things, ice cream and donuts.  Yesssss, please. They almost got 5 stars easily, but you can not go in the shop.  It is drive thru only. The dining area is closed. Part of going to an ice cream parlor is the experience where you can see the ice cream in the freezer, sample some flavors and ask questions face to face before making one of the biggest decisions of you life....what ice cream to get. Plus for those who have a long drive, it is hard to have the ice cream sit for the 30-40 drive home. Do I pull over and eat it or do I speed home and hope not to get a ticket in the process.  Devouring it in their dining area would solve that dilemma.

They have daily flavors available and are on the board as you drive up. Some flavors are there one day and then may be gone the next, if not the same day. Anyway, of course I got the donut sandwich with raspberry rumble ice cream.  I could not wait to get home and dig in. It did not disappoint.  My crew got a cup of the cookie monster, cookies and creme and strawberry.  They all loved their ice cream too.  Theirs did not make it home. The staff there was so friendly. They even showed us what some of the ice cream that we were not familiar with looked like such as the cloud, which by the way is cotton candy on a cone.

I am sure they will get that 5th star from me soon.  They have exquisite ice cream, top notch staff and donuts. What more do you need?  I can not wait to get back here.  Hopefully the parlor will be open for dine in by then. I highly recommend checking this place out to satisfy your sweet tooth."
