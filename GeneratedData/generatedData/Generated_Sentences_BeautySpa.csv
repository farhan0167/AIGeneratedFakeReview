Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Had organic gel mani and pedi with mango treatment and it was fabulous! The store is so clean and gorgeous. The staff is friendly. The pedicure is way above the quality of the typical pedicure you find in a strip mall salon. I will definitely make this my regular salon for my mani pedi needs.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've had a membership here for just over amonth, and I love it! The place is spotless, the staff is very polite, and the price just can't be beat!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I have to admit I was extremely nervous about anyone touching my eyebrows! I have waxed them myself after a bad experience many years ago. My best friend convinced me tonight to try threading my eyebrows & I'm HOOKED! Rashmi is an Absolute Artist & I can't thank her enough 4 my  beautiful eyebrows
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Ricky & Twee are great! I came to this place to replace my other salon and it's so nice and clean. A little more pricey but the service was great and everyone was super friendly. It was Ricky & Twee's first day there but they're super experienced and did a great job on my acrylics.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been to Christie's a few times now and have always been happy with the results.  Fast service and all the latest when it comes to nail stuff.  They were one of the first places I know of that got the shellac and OPI gel.  Friendly professional service, I would def recommend."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Tried this place as it is closer than the salon I was using. I can not recommend it at all. In less than 1 week the majority of the lashes have fallen out. I was able to get 4 weeks from last salon. Such a waste of $200.
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Just wanted a simple manicure. Unfortunately the woman that did my nails wasn't to experienced. I left with super short, roughly filed nails with paint that still wouldn't dry an hour later! The coats were put on to quickly and the polish just gummed up. I had to come home and take the polish off."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been to many nail salons around Philly and this is my favorite. It's not overpriced, and the quality of service is excellent. Yes, it can be crowded--but with at least 3 other nail salons within a quarter-mile, wouldn't that be a good sign?! Free parking reimbursement is also a huge plus for the yunk!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Angel is a miracle worker! Between her and the assistant/receptionist (didn't catch his name) I had a great relaxing morning and left with stunning hair.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,I absolutely love this place. It's the first time in a LONG time that I've been to a place that actually took the time to remove the rough skin from the heels and balls of my feet. Not just a quick zip zip of the purple loofah thing. This will definitely become my regular place!

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Great place, and an excellent haircut. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the owner is a bit rude. The front desk girl is very nice and welcoming. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the haircut itself was subpar."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Go to this place for your pedicure but NOT your nails. If you go in and tell them you are getting both they will rush your pedicure. They have many color options, great pedicure services, however they are not the best at nails. Nice place, nice ppl. Before covid, they served frozen drinks, wine, water, etc."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love DnA Salon! They have wonderful customer service. I have seen 3 stylists because of scheduling and all were amazing! Now I go to Grace every time. I would trust anyone there to cut my hair, which is saying a lot since I used to go home to Boston for haircuts before I found DnA."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Travis Jay give better blonde than anyone. I have had at least 25 different stylist and no one has ever listened to me, or taken the time to give me exactly what I want like Travis. And the salon is just gorgeous inside. Overall it was an amazing experience and I highly recommend it to anyone."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've been there twice for piercing and have had a positive experience both times. I was just a walk-in to pierce my nose... all of the guys were friendly, just hanging out in the shop and I was waited on immediately. 

I plan to go back for a tattoo.. anyone else have any words of advice?"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"For them having a late policy, they are constantly running behind on scheduled times. I've waiting the ""9 minutes"" after my appointment time a handful of times. Other then them never being on time, the staff is friendly and knowledgable! Cherry hill and Mount laurel run much better on their schedules than the Cinnaminson location does."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My first time here, but very unlikely to be back.  Dirty floors.  Older, uncomfortable chairs and only a mediocre pedicure.  The layout of the place reminds me more of a bus terminal than a spa.  Not relaxing at all, and no attempt to reduce the strong headache-inducing acetone smell.  Skip it."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Love this place!  Best consistent hair cuts I have ever had...and they do a great job on my two sons as well.  The long waits have gone down since they have basically become appointment only.  It's a little more expensive now since they are appointment only, but well worth it in my opinion."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,One of the best salons around!  My daughter and I enjoyed a very professional classic manicure during our 'girls day out' and enjoyed the clean friendly atmosphere!

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Needed my beard cleaned up and found Dave. He did an outstanding job getting me looking presentable. I'm a first time beard guy, so I had let it grow so he would have something to work with. Price was good and he cleaned things up real well."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I happened to come across this salon when I was having lunch next door and so glad I did.

GREAT experience!!!!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I was turned away 15 mins before closing... employees stating that they already closed out the drawer and cleaned up their stations. 

I've worked retails jobs in the past and you don't turn customers away until the time posted on the door. All cleanup to be done after you lock the doors. 

Very poor customer service."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Did not inform me that they re opened -just started billing me again.  To top it off during a pandemic they still are not allowing you to cancel your membership by phone. I can understand pre-COVID-19 but still? This is poor service. Really nothing online? You must come in person or send a certified letter.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,My appointment was at 10:30.  I waited for 45 minutes!  I was told I could go do errands and come back!  I will never go back!  I'm never doing groupons again for mani pedi .  It is not worth it!  I'd rather pay more and go to a professional salon.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Esther and all the staff are very friendly and great. She was very careful but precise with removing my acrylic nails.

Pedicure $17"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Horrible experience. Don't waste your time. They upcharge at every opportunity, do poor work-shellac comes off within days, and they are slow-even if you schedule an appointment, they won't honor the time-just keep delaying 5 more minutes... 5 more minutes... almost done... until you've sat there for half an hour and still haven't so much as started"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Got a great cut from Emma! It was my first time so I wasn't sure what to expect but she rocked it. The salon is small and was pretty busy so It was very loud. I went on a Tuesday to get the discount but next time will be paying full price because the quality deserves it!
Beauty & Spas,1.0,OR,Horrible service. Do NOT go here. They were rude and pushy. Rushed the whole job and my nails look awful. I'm pretty sure my five year old would do a better job at painting my nails.  I also question how sanitary this place is and hope I don't end up with an infection from the place.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I've been here 3 times and have not been disappointed. The atmosphere is very soothing and the massages are amazing. They give you free (finger) food and drinks (fruit infused water and mimosas). Took my husband for a couples massage as well and he enjoyed it as well. I had a facial and walked out feeling superb.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Haircut with Jeannie  She always does a phenomenal job with my difficult hair. For the first time in my life I don't have to style it everyday and can just wash, scrunch, and leave it.  She's magic!!

Regarding their Covid procedures: the entire place is super clean and sterile. Stations are separated and everyone is masked and distanced."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Very consistent service. I've been coming here for at least 3 years. I usually only get my eyebrows but occasionally my chin, as well.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"All stylists had masks on. Except one blond lady who wore a face shield and No mask. Your breath just escapes. It needs to be a mask, not just a plastic shield in front of your face.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,This place is the worst. Bought a Groupon and scheduled an appointment. They called the day before that appointment and said I had to reschedule. I was annoyed but obliged. Arrived for my appointment today and was told I would need to reschedule and that they had tried to reach me (which they had not). Horrible horrible service-could not recommend less!!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Overall the experience and pricing was good. I plan to go back to try this salon again. I was disappointed with the dip nails. They made them so thin that the cracked after having them for a week. The person doing my nails dropped a tool on the ground and got a new clean tool, so that was nice to see."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Great experience here. Clean and friendly environment. The spa is actually about an hour from where I live but I will definitely make the drive to return. They were very accommodating to me based off of my circumstances and the appointment time that I needed I greatly appreciate everything that skin sensational went out of their way to do for me.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Unfortunately it hasn't even been a week and my nails look like crap! They didn't last the gel is coming off and it looks like I've had these nails for a month . I take care of nails always the same. 
Unfortunately the hype was FAKE! I called to have Lee fix them and I was told he's busy.... Maybe later..."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I got a deal on Groupon and Dina was nearby. She made me feel at ease right away. The mood was relaxing, calming and the room smelled lovely. Dina asked me questions before we began. It was so relaxing, she listened to what I wanted and she delivered. I will definitely be going back soon! Thanks for a great experience Dina."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I used to come here for years, but ever since they opened up their second location a year ago the talent has diminished. The prices are different at the two locations, the last 2 foot rubs (during pedicures) left much to be desired, and it's only been 4 days since my pedicure and my feet don't look very good. I'm disappointed."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Great first time experience! The staff is friendly and they have a clean facility. Their selection of magazines was greats and the music was a nice mix of Sinatra and relaxing tunes. My pedicure came with a very long massage and I feel as though the technician took her time to really work on my toes! I will be coming back!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I had the Agave Smoothing Treatment and a month later I am still loving it!!!!  My hair was damaged from too many color changes, after this treatment my hair feels soooo health. I'll be coming back regularly for this natural treatment. I love that it doesn't have chemicals but uses real Agave. Thanks for letting me love my hair again!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Tried it twice. First time was ok but the second time I walked in and it looked like I got attacked by a weed whacker including shaving burns on my neck, lopsided sideburns, an uneven cut on my part. 

If you find someone you like here, I would consider going here regularly but you run the risk of a bad haircut."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,Muself and two others have been waiting for over an hour for a pedi and no one seems to care.  This was the same case three wee hours s ago when I was hear.  Let me put my flip flops on and go somewhere else.  Adios forever JC Nails!  Stop being stingy and hire some more staff.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Love love love lauren. Used her for a wedding to feel glamorous and after we were done, felt more confident and fabulous. Was nervous it would be too much lash but we talked through it together and felt/looked very natural.  Am working on figuring out when my next big event is to go a little more bolder with the length!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I took my grandma Here for a manicure and pedicure. The pedicure was great. The polish job was great, but the manicure was not so great. The massage was not good. It was very rushed. The paint job was very sloppy. There was polish all over my nails and"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Terrible waxing. The room wasn't cleaned. The wax was painful. My left leg is sore and the skin is so painful. The technician was also very rough with her hands. She was rough with my legs and her hands were cut so bad that it bled and bled.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This place is average. I go to the same girl every two weeks. When I got a pedicure, I had to get a pedicure the next day. The lady kept pushing my cuticles back and when I said no, she told me I had to go home and file them myself."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Omg!!!! Seriously the best salon in the area!! Great prices too! Also my nails look awesome!Great haircut from Brie! I am a very picky person, so it was hard to find a good hair salon in the area. Brie listened to what I wanted and did exactly what I was"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've been going to Salon West on Walsingham for years, and have been taking my two daughters for the past couple of years as well. We all see Chelsea, and she is awesome! She is professional, personable and attentive. She listens and offers great suggestions. I've never been disappointed. The rest of the staff is friendly and attentive as well. Highly recommend."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The place is gorgeous, minimalist accents and the whole aura of the place is amazing. They take people by appointments during the week and walk-ins on weekends. I've gone a least 3-4 times on a Saturday and the waiting time is not bad at all, plus who can't complain about waiting while holding a nice glass of wine."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"We stopped here while traveling from Las Vegas to Sonoma County over the Thanksgiving holiday. We found a deal through hotels.com and booked it right away. Check-in was easy and the staff was very friendly. Overall a solid place to stay with updated rooms. The drawbacks include: no microwave access in the rooms or elsewhere, a service fee for accessing the hotel."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Had my first visit to Robin Dove Hair Studio yesterday.  Had a Living Social deal for a keratin treatment. Juanita worked on my hair and she was FANTASTIC!

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Kim is honestly such a gem! It was my first time seeing her (or getting a gel manicure to be honest) and she was amazing. Very friendly, comfortable, and just a great way to spend a ""ME"" day for my birthday.  Her color selections are amazing. And she really has a gift for people and for nails.  Highly Highly Recommend."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I have been coming to this salon since they have opened. Sheri has always gone out of her way to not only fill my nails wonderfully, but her ideas and attention to detail create  unique one of a kind nail art.  The pedicures here are the best. I have occasionally gotten pedicures from other places and have always left disappointed."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,I watched a girl take the tools that she used on my hands and then used it on my cousins feet to apply acrylic on he toe nail. Then she got ready to use it on the next person. Behind the pedi chairs it's really dirty.  Don't see myself ever going back. Only if your down to catch a nail fungus.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,It says they're open at 8:30 and walk-ins are welcome.  I was there at 8:45 as a walk-in. It was not open.  I called the woman who answered said they only take appointments and plan their hours accordingly.  She made no effort to accommodate me.  No when can you make an appointment or I can come in now.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Really affordable but you get what you pay for. The guy doing my nails never cleaned away the excess acrylic build up under my nails. Being that I didn't notice until I got home, I wasn't gonna drive back to get it fixed. A friend recommended this place to me and I drove over half an hour each way to get here."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been going to this European Wax Center exclusively  for two years. They have the best staff. Kiki has done my eyebrows once a month every month for the past two years. I currently live in Southern California, so whenever I fly back to Nashville I have to stop by EWC to get my eyebrows done, I don't trust anyone else!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I went here with my 7 year old to get a hair cut today..it was our first time here. I absolutely loved it. Cassie was wonderful! I will definitely be coming back. It's difficult to find a great stylist with a personality to match, and both of our stylists today were good examples of this... See you soon, for our next haircuts!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Been here once and fell in love with it. This salon is clean, modern and the staffs are super friendly. I got mu name done by Kim and she seemed to know what she was doing.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"This place is awesome! After months of looking for a good place to get a massage I found Wellness Spa, the first time I went by myself and was beyond good! Staff was super friendly and the lady did an excellent job, very professional.

Prices are fair and atmosphere clean!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I am super paranoid about my hair being cut but the ladies here know what they are doing and are super helpful and talented . The didn't cut too much off and my bangs were way nicer than I am used to . It's a little expensive but I'd rather get a good cut than pay less and have a crappy one
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I came in with hair that was way overdue for a cut. I've found it difficult to find a good men's stylist in the city that won't butcher my hair, so i had been putting it off.

Vann did exactly what I was looking for. I showed him some examples on Pinterest and he nailed it. I'd highly recommended him for mens haircuts!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Jaxson did an amazing job on my gel acrylics! He showed a great attention to detail and took his time to make sure the shape and color were perfect. It was a very refreshing experience because I'm used to nail bars that just try to rush people in and out as quickly as possible.

The salon itself was extremely clean, pretty, and COVID-safe."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I would give Hand and Stone Locust Street less then a star but it doesn't exist. BRIANNA and staff on Sunday's crew are the rudest group that pick and choose  their clients. If you are not up to their liking, then you will get laughed and publicly humiliated! Their work is just satisfactory and it is NOT WORTH it at all."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Darryl is a fantastic massage therapist. I've had a few massages before, but this one was the best.  The front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming. The massages are amazing. I highly recommend this place.I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Ardie is interesting to say the least. She does a great job for really cheap, great for broke college students! Be warned though, she tells some crazy stories. If it's your first time going she definitely keeps you distracted and it's over in no time. Sometimes she is not super detailed but she still gets the job done and definitely worth returning to!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I too had a charming/relaxing experience here.  I had a coupon for a free manicure with an ""at cost."" pedicure.  The space was clean and had quiet background (seasonal) music playing.  Their was very little in-house chatter and my technician was very professional.  
They use Dermalogica products for facials so I will return.  It was a real find."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I give this salon a one star because of the sanitation. My toes turned out fine but all of the pedicure tools did not look clean and were definitely not sanitized. The way they wash off tools is just a used scrubber and some water, this is unacceptable. The price is cheap but I would much rather pay more for a sanitary pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Sara helped me with my first skin consultation as a young woman! She was so helpful and so full of knowledge.

She helped make me feel confident in my own skin again! Thank you Sara & iRevive!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I got a dip manicure about a week ago, and it completely started to fall apart. The first day I was getting chips and cracks - definitely not normal with dip polish. I was frustrated and a little disappointed. But Polished was so great! They immediately fixed my nails and they look wonderful!! So happy with Polished and will continue to come back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been patronizing these amazing nail techs for over 10 years.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love this spa. The organic commitment, the services and the staff are all fabulous.

I guess if you don't open the email of me cancelling my membership then you have technically not received it,  What a rip off DO NOT JOIN THIS CLUB"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,I have been sitting in the office for an hour and a half. It is an hour and 10 minutes past my appointment time and I still have not seen the doctor. The whole staff seems lazy and more concentrated on things other the patients. I would never choose to come back here. Even though the doctor office is terrible the Spa is great.
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I decided to try this salon out because it's right next door to my gym.  I love getting the dip powder nails done and have done it at a couple other places.

I liked the friendliness of the staff, the salon was clean and organized.  What I didn't like was that they didn't have a huge selection of colors for the dip option."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Clean environment. Technicians take their time. There has been no wait times anytime I had an appointment. Love the use of clean products, chemical free smell salon. The owner is really sweet, I attended a lash class as a model and she gave me a $50 gift card which was great! I've referred my sister here and will continue to do so for others."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This was a great pedicure experience! I arrived a little early for my appointment, but they seated me immediately, offered me a drink and started the soak. The staff were all very friendly, the place was very neat and clean. The hot stone foot massage was an excellent little perk! The price seems to be comparable to other places. I will probably go back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This overpriced salon does not do a good job in basic service. The salon staff are very very very very very very very very very very very very slow. 

I appreciate their attempts at conversation but this lengthens the overall experience of the haircut and most of us have places to be. The tired request of ""Just a few more minutes"" doesn't ""cut"" it."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"South Beach tanning on 22nd Ave N.. Everyone here have always been Great! Owner on down to any employees, just have always been nice, helpful & knowledgeable when I've had any questions about tanning or even the lotions they carry, If you're looking for a place to get your tan on, & still be smiling as you're leaving, I suggest this be your place!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have had only great experiences at this nail spa. I've been coming here for 6 months and the work is consistently good. The manager, Robert, is on top of his business and keeps the services flowing well. Everyone is so friendly, it's been such a pleasure to go there. Services are 7 days a week so you can always figure out an appointment."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Peppermill has improved substantially. It now offers near-Vegas (well, cheap Vegas, but still) amenities like a fairly amazingly Grecko-Roman pool/spa area, a beautiful new bar that's circular and includes a fairly amazing shell-like chandelier and new, ever-improving penny slot machine.  Play the 1 cent ""Deal or No Deal"" slots near the poker room for hours of entertainment and drinks for a mere $10."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Great place! My friend and I went here and we each got mani/pedi for $35. The place is very clean and the workers are very nice. The only thing I would warn about is that it took longer than it should have. Which means they were attentive and did a good job. But if you're in a rush, you might not have enough time."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,A friendly personable crew of employees. One of the few salons that I have been to that actually know how to properly give a crew cut. I always leave happy and the prices are competitive. A long running Salon in the neighborhood had closed by the name of Chop Shop. They did the neighborly thing and took some of the employees in.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I am really sad because this place is so close to my home. I have been to multiple different places before finding this place. The first time I went was okay. The second time was okay. I went in for a pedicure and manicure and was still waiting for about 5 minutes. The woman was really nice
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I love the color selection here. The only complaint is that they don't have the massage chairs.I had an excellent experience here! I got the basic manicure and it was amazing!

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Finally!!!

I tried out a bunch of places near my residence and none of them lived up to their price. Not to mention, the amount of time that I wasted. Nail Spa Bar is really worth it! Every time I go their, it's been the same level of commitment and friendliness. I love them so much, I trusted them to do my nails for my wedding."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I was experiencing sciatic pain running through my knee.  I approached Dr. Shanfeld who not only corrected my lower back pain issue but healed the arthritis in my shoulder...I thought I'd have shoulder discomfort for life.     I've been hooked to chiropractic medicine since.  For six years I've been visit Dr. Shanfeld and his team to stay in top form.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,I love them! I've been a Patron for about 6 months now and they are my go-to spot. I prefer for Tweety to do my nails because she is very good and fast. I don't have a preference for my pedi's. That are a bit pricy but I prefer liquid gel overlay with gel polish so I expect that to cost. I don't like acrylic.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"My husband, daughter and I have been going to Tibet since they opened. Not only did we score with location (walking for us) but the owner Michelle is amazing. You can't beat the prices and the full body massage or a foot massage is incredible. Beautiful ambience and comfortable beds. My husband and I try to go every Sunday to start our week off right!!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Way cool...

I went for a wax today and I was very pleased. The wax they use is really interesting... It didn't even hurt! Well a little bit... but not as bad as a regular wax. After regular wax your skin feels all irritated. But with the blue wax they use, I felt all relaxed after. I'll definitely go back. The people were very friendly too,"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Way over priced   I went for a manicure and pedicure!  I didn't schedule a hot towel pedicure but that's what I got!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"EXCELLENT service, glad I tried this salon! Long story short - the dip color I picked ended up being nothing like the sample color.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,After years of contemplation I finally decided to go with laser hair removal.  I just finished my first treatment and am already so happy I did.  A little self care goes a long way.  Holly was the technician and she was absolutely wonderful.  She made me feel so comfortable and confident in this decision.  I really appreciate her caring and skillful work.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,What a wonderful experience.   One of the best pedicures I've ever had.  The massage was so relaxing. Holly was extremely attentive.  The massage chair was comfortable.  The place was clean.  Tons of colors to choose from.  They offer you red/white wine or water free of charge.   If you are in this area this is the place to go.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Vanesa is the QUEEN of balayage! I've gone to her for years now and can't have any other stylist touch my hair! Her knowledge. Her persona. Her demeanor. Her ART. Just everything about her makes me want to come back. Not only does she bring magic to my hair, she always makes me feel welcomed in her salon  thank you V for doing what you do!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Been going to Ground Zero for almost a year now.  Erin is awesome!  She listens AND HEARS what you want and then proceeds to cut you hair the way you want!  Amazing concept, eh?  I look forward to going in for my haircut just to see the girls (Wendy, Erin and Kathy!)!  Give them a try.  You will not be disappointed!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was referred to Christy by a friend and could not be happier.  I have been using Botox for many years and find that Christy here in Tucson is the very best.   She is very experienced, informative, and is truly concerned on what my needs are and her prices are so reasonable.  There is no other I would trust for my cosmetic needs."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I have been getting keratin treatments for the past 6 years and have been to dna twice now. I don't plan on going anywhere else even though I've moved to NJ. Everyone they have working is extremely nice and filled with great advice on top of that the price for keratin is competitive for the area. The two stylists I've had are Rick and Christie- both awesome.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I've had my hair done by both Steph and Katie.  They are both extremely professional and always give me exactly what i want in a style and color.  I had pretty messed up hair before seeing these girls but they worked their magic and gave me the color I'd been dreaming of! Thank you for the beautiful hair and making my hair dreams come true!
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"If you're looking for a place to have a child's hair cut, this is it! Debbie did such an amazing job with our 3yr olds first hair cut. She distracted him, showed him all of her tools so he wouldn't be nervous and did such a cute cut on him, exactly what we wanted. Will definitely be going back to her for all of his future cuts!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I originally went to Artisans Salon with a Groupon for a haircut, and ended up getting a cut, color, toner, and an hour and a half of great conversation with Danielle! Considering how beat up my hair was when I walked into the salon, I left feeling like a model with an awesome, professional new 'do! Danielle is seriously a miracle worker, regardless of your hair's condition."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"My daughter and I had our brows done today.  We weren't offered a choice between waxing and threading.  She threaded both of us.  We were unaware until we paid that waxing (which we both prefer) is an option.  The bigger issue though, is that she didn't respect my daughter's wish to keep her brows thick, and shaped them much thinner than she wanted."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was in New Orleans and knew that I wanted to come get tattooed here from seeing their work on Instagram. Once I arrived, it definitely lived up to the hype. 

All of the artists do great work, the get what you get selection is all quality traditional art and the shop is clean and inviting. 

Definitely the spot to go in New Orleans for a tattoo."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"If you like massage like I do, then you know that some folks have ""the hands""  others don't. Gwen should insure her hands for mucho dinero. She's got a gift. Kind, attentive, patient, thorough - can't really say enough. Her space has ample parking, and the interior is quiet and charming. Nice music, too. Book ahead - I'm not her only fan by a long shot."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"We love Spavia! We were going to another place for massages and got locked into a contract that was almost impossible to break. It was a stressful experience, so we were hesitant to join another spa. Spavia put our minds at ease. We love going here! The therapists are wonderful. Services are priced well. Great ambiance...we look forward to our visits. 
Keep doing what you're doing Spavia!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Awesome!  So glad I found this salon.  I just walked in and they took me with no hesitation.  Pedicure was fabulous.  Everyone there is super friendly and it looks very clean.   The extra care they take with their customers shows.  I never had a massage while waiting for my toes to dry!  Will def. go back.  Thank you.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"(READ WHOLE REVIEW) Giving them 5 starts because all of the staff here is amazing EXCEPT ERIN. She is completely RUDE, unprofessional, and unknowledgeable. DO NOT book with her, you will be SO disappointed. I've had a yearly wax pass with EWC for 3 years, I always tip very well, and she was AWFUL. Made my experience terrible. (Dee and Carmela are amazing so book with them!)"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Awesome Service! The owner provide the highest level of service. This is by far one of the best nail salons in area. The nail tech are experienced and professional! The location is clean and well maintained.

I had a gel manicure and pedicure.  I was really impressed with the massage"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I went here to get a fill and the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I went back in the next day to get it fixed and she told me it was going to be a while and she'd be in a bit. I told her to just do it again and she said no. I was going to get a

Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,Discovered Floris in Exton on a whim and thought it would be a great place for a relaxing pedicure. I had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. The only complaint is that the nail tech was working on my nails for a while. The nail tech was very rough with the cut
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"If I could give this place a zero star, I would. The person who did my pedicure was nice, but the massage was not great. She cut me twice with the tool and then moved on to the manicure. My nails look like they had been painted by a 2 year old."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,This place is great. The owner is super sweet and makes you feel at home. She does a great job and I always leave feeling so relaxed and rejuvenated. I'm a very picky person and I look forward to going to her every time.I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous because
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I'm  almost  scared that my hair will look like I did it for a period of time. If you are looking for someone to fix your hair, I highly recommend you call and ask for Stephanie. I have very thick hair and she does a great job."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,They had a special offering for a free manicure which was a nice surprise for me since it was a busy day. The place was clean and the staff was friendly.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been seeing Aleah Funcheon at Rejuve for several years regularly for color, highlights, cut and brows.  She's fantastic and super friendly - she especially gets my curly hair problems!  They are almost always running on time for appointments and give their clients their full attention.  Great knowledge of their services and products as well as current styles.  Highly recommend Aleah and Rejuve."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Dr. Arianna!! I've been to see her twice for botox. She is the BEST! I sincerely mean the best. I've been to afew places for botox in my time and no one comes close to her. 
I walk in with a smile and leave with a smile. 
Thank you Dr. Arianna for your expertise and lovely personality! 
-Trina Jones"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been going to this salon regularly for a few months now, and I love it. Eileen is amazing with my blonde highlights and always knows how to make me feel beautiful. The staff is friendly and the salon is clean. They are also great about getting me in for an appointment last minute which is super important with my busy schedule. I highly recommend this place."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I can even give this place one star!! Worst place ever. Went for a pedi. Waited 25 minutes to get my pedi. No problem waiting. Yet once I finally got in the chair for a pedi I was there in the chair with no service until the water got cold at which point I walked out.  Will not ever go back or recommend this place to anyone.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,I went there after a bad experience at another salon and my nail tech did an awesome job. I tend to be really picky about my nails and he was super nice and fixed everything. I will definitely be coming back. It would have gotten 5 stars but he kinda messed up my thumb.  But again I am super picky. I definitely recommend this place to anyone.
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,These people are crooks.  They quote me $16 CAD to repair 3 gel nails.  When they find out I am from USA they charge me $21.00 or $16.02 American.  The little guy that runs this place is a crook.  Do not do business with them.  I would give him zero stars if I could.  The nails he fixed broke 3 days later.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Uptown barber bar has got to be one of the most laid back places in St. Petersburg! I had the pleasure of working with spencer today, he was very personal and the hot towels, beer and shampoo was just the beginning! 

Very good for the price it's at (24$). I recommend it hands down over any barber shop in st pete. Thank you Spencer for the awesome cut!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Definitely not disappointed. Pretty good place. The younger kids that work here seem like they come and go. Not as committed to excellence and wanting to overly please. It's just something you feel like they got a job but it's u til they get to the next. 
It could use an interior update feels unfinished. 
Not really I
Pressed but in a pinch it works 
They are always busy"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Came here on a fluke! Needed my eyebrows done badly. Took only a few minutes and the results are clean and beautiful with minimal pain. She also did my upper lip area, it hurts so be ready! :) super smooth and happy. Please keep in mind threading is typically more painful than waxing but better for skin and sensitive people! My results last waaaaay longer when I thread."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"The girl doing my wife's nails was extremely rude, over charged by five dollars instead of of the $30, as agreed by the lady who was at the door, and demanded that she be given a tip. DEMANDED! Are you kidding me? Add to that the fact that she didn't even do a great job, and blamed it on my wife indecisiveness. Will not be returning there again."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Today was the first time I had ever gone to Blu Nail Salon. I figured I would try out a new place that was much closer to where I live. I am officially hooked! The gentleman who did my nails took his time, made sure everything was absolutely perfect, and did an incredible job. I will definitely be coming here from now on to get my nails done!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Walked in today and got a haircut from Mike. I didn't realize that M-F was appointment only but he was free. Had a great conversation and the cut was very well done. I found a new barber.   

Saturdays there are no appointments needed.  

Also, cash & check only, though I was able to go to the ATM and back. A good group of guys here."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I have always been so embarrassed by facial hair. I called and made an appointment with Olivia for a consultation. After talking with her I was ready to start the procedure with her immediately but she didn't have time!  I made an appointment of course and have been going regularly. I feel so much better about myself thanks to Olivia! I recommend her and Body Basics highly.

Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,Me and a couple friends here have been going to this salon for years now. I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the best one. They do a great job and are friendly. I have been to other places for my gel manicures and they have always been a disappointment. They have the most beautiful color selection
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"This place is a ripoff. The woman who did my nails did a sloppy job and the paint job was sloppy. The nails look terrible and the paint job was sloppy. I will never go back.

After my tattoo, I was given a tour of the shop and the shop itself"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Kevin's hair salon is a great place to get your haircut and coloring! They seem to have a lot of people that like their balayage and bleach skills, which I think is fantastic because not a lot of places are on that level yet. I like coming here because although they usually cut long hair pretty easily and well enough for the decent price that's under $20 for women."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I went here for the first time and I'm never going to another nail salon in Tampa, only this one! They were amazing Tommy took my acrylic nails off for me and Rachael painted my nails & waxed my eyebrows .... both did a fantastic job! Everyone there was so friendly and welcoming and all the customers around me seemed very pleased as well. This place is absolutely wonderful!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I've been going here for years. They are all so sweet and pleasant. AMAZING price. Only 8$ to thread your eyebrows. I always go to Roop but I have gotten my eyebrows threaded by them all. Love them. I suggest it to anybody in the Brandon/Valrico areas. They even do henna tattoos. I would call ahead though to ensure they can do it because they don't all do henna.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"MIKAYLA Capelo is my hair hero!! I have very dark hair and previously to going to her, my hair would instantly turn orange when going to other salons. I was always so scared to go to anyone until I was referred to Mikayla. She colors my brunette hair perfectly and always makes sure I'm happy with the result! I promise you, you will get the bang for your buck!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Ive come to this salon numerous times, and all of the
 Were pleasant. However this time I went one of the new ladies and was rude and got an attitude because I had to get cash out the atm and corrected her because she almost mispainted my nails. Overall her paint job and work was ok. It'll be a while before I return. 

The other ladies are great though!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Well, I have had a full opposite review than anyone else! Possible that i have had a good representative. She was a really nice lady at Londonderry ( little one who do not speak fluent English - looked kinda Spanish) my eyebrows are being complimented and noticed by everyone ! And that is making me wants to go back do my eyebrows again and again in the same place!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"This is the worst nail salon in collinsville. The pedicures were horrible, i had to wait 30 minutes even though I had an appointment. Customer service was the worst I've ever experienced. A male in the salon literally yelled at me, because i asked if she could work some more of the dead skin off my feet. He was so rude. Do not go there."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Visited for the first time today! This is a very convenient location from where I live. They do not take appointments, but I waited no longer than probably fifteen minutes. The three people working served at least 12 customers during the time I was there. For how busy it was I was very impressed. I had a gel mani and pedi and it looks fantastic! Will be back again."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I've had my hair done by Deanna and Kristy I. Both are very amazing stylists. Deanna took my hair to a beautiful, healthy blonde.

Jayci does amazing nail designs. The staff is very friendly."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Every time I go the owner ""(Amy)"" cuts my hands till I bleed while doing my full sets or fills. She's always rushing for no reason...I would recommend asking for someone else or not going at all...she just says ""ohhh sorry"" like she doesn't know she did it when it's every time. I have multiple friends who use to go as well and they always cut their hands to."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Had not gotten a haircut in over a year due to pandemic concerns and my former salon closed. First time at Lakshmi and struck by how clean it was! Got a GREAT haircut from Vinny! I feel lucky to have had been set up with him and will definitely return and request him.  Stations are well spaced and I had my own mask on for the entire session.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Salt MedSpa has been an amazing spa to have in Hendersonville.

They have proven to not be overwhelmed by too small or too large a request. They run amazing specials for top of the line services. Best spa in the area!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Dr. Shulman is the best dentist I have ever been to. His staff are so friendly and accommodating and the office is very clean and up to date. Dr. Shulman straightened my crooked teeth with Invisalign. My friends are so jealous and the process was painless and quick. I have gotten cavities filled as well and they were also painless. I no longer fear the dentist. Thanks Dr.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I decided to give tipsy nails & spa a try because I never have enough time to make an appointment at Posh and my favorite nail tech there is always booked.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Awful service. They made me feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable. I was in tears for a whole hour and a half before I could even get out.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Do yourself a favor and don't go here for color. I went in for highlights and walked out with BLACK hair. Not only is it black with a touch of brassy copper highlights but it is damaged from the highlight process. Christie really had no clue what she was doing when it came to color and didn't take any responsiblity for her terrible work. I am a very disappointed customer!
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I am very obsessive about my nails and I'm very specific about how I like them done. Benny and the girls do a fabulous job and really listen to you.   This salon is always clean, bright and welcoming. I have tried many different nail salons, both in PA and CA, and B & J is the best I have found! 
P.S. They are all really nice and funny!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Absolutely awful. The owner did my refill and gel polish. I should have walked out when I saw the Polish color selections. The refill was done well but the paint job was awful. He didn't even paint the sides of my nails. I spent 1hr 20 mins in there and my nails look like shit.... 

I wouldn't even let them repaint them. Only chose 1 star because I had too"

My colorist was sophia My hair came out awsome, I totally loved it, but a bit on the pricey side. Even so it's still my first choice in salons. I definitely will be back, i think it well worth it."
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"Terrible experience. Dirty place. Dark. Old. Yuck. Embarrassed that I went here, but I needed a pedicure quickly. I was talked into a GEL manicure. The pedicure was messy. Then she added $5 for a cheese grater on my foot, without telling me. Then the bill came to $60+. I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Highly recommend that you don't go either. Shame on them for this service. Really a sham."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I love this place! Moved into the area 2 years ago and so happy to have found this place less than a minute walk from my house! All of the techs are good. My gels last at least 2 weeks. In 2 years I've had a small issue with 2 nails. Both were fixed fast with a smile and no charge. I will always come here for my nail needs!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I've been having my nails done here for several years - only because my manicurist, Kathy, is wonderful. She's friendly and thoroughly professional. However, the salon on the whole is ordinary. Most of the other manicurists do not engage customers at all and the owner is unfriendly. Prices were raised after the New Year...an additional $5.00 for gel / powder. I think it's time to look for a new salon."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Hannah as well as her sister Adriana give the  best mani/pedi! I only go to them especially for my gel mani's b/c not only are they so meticulous but their gel mani's last for weeks!! Unlike most places, they do 2 base coats and 2 top coats so when it is time to get your nails redone, it's super easy to peel off the old."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Been going to this place for at least 16 years. I only went there for so long because the nail techs are so great! But the owner is no good. Every time I go she asks over and over to pay cash because she don't wanna pay taxes. As she does for every customer. I just left there today, I paid with my credit card and she over charged me."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Horrible nail salon. Bought a Groupon I called for months they would not give me an appointment. I could not get my money back from Groupon because they set it up that way. Finally went services were nothing special I see why they need to use Groupon to get any business after being there so many years. Would not recommend this place for anything. It's not worth the Groupon price!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,Suzi did two tattoos for me about a week ago and they turned out great. I got a small cross on my wrist and a feather on the inside of my foot. Both tattoos came out great and I could not be happier. I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone. They were very professional and I was happy with their services. Suzi is awesome and did an amazing job.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I absolutely love this place!!!! I lived in Tucson for almost 7 years and have recently moved back to Alaska.

Here's what I got today and I am so excited to have cute new years nails!!!!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"If you have a pair and don't get your hair cut here you don't gotta pair. Best spot in Philly. Straight razor the neck, your dome, whatever. Relaxed atmosphere and superb cuts. I only go to straight barbers and love old time dudes cutting hair but this is staffed by the next generation which is a nice twist. I won't go anywhere else at this point. Always tip your barber."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My second time here I love here. Staffs are friendly all. Clean and have all things u need ( body oil, hair gel etc). And they have healthy snacks ( nuts) and lemon water which is so good and have choices of really good teas. And it's so relaxing. Third floor Himalayan salt room is relaxing too. 4th floor u can tan ur body it's beautiful view."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Aweful work...don't waste your money unless you want faded tattoos with jagged lines...especially if you go to ""T Nez"". That guy has the heaviest hand in the south. I would give 2 Extreme Tattoos a 0 out of 5 if I could based on T Nez working there alone. He is literally in it for the money and does not care about the actual art that he tattoos onto your body."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been living in the Vail/Rita Ranch area for years, and while I love the community and school district, it doesn't seem to attract a lot of high quality businesses. That said, Gentleman Jacks is truly a first rate barbershop that has no equal in the area, much less Tucson in general. All of the barbers are excellent and Joaquin has created an incredibly upscale/comfortable environment. I cannot recommend it more."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Called for a same day appointment for a wash and blow dry. Was give  a same day slot to accommodate my schedule. I was a little tardy, but was greeted by a friendly lady behind the counter. A pleasant young man was assigned to me. He quickly took care of my hair and had me on my way. I was very pleased with this experience and will return."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"A friend recommended this place. It was very mediocre.It had a big screen tv with a program I did not like, rather than quiet music. The owners were very distant, and not friendly. The man who did my pedicure was not thorough, did not touch the cuticles, and he was hard to speak with. I have been to other places for the same price and better result. I will not return."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,We walked in without an appointment.  The place was spacious and they served wine but you'll have to ask for it.  For a $35 pedicure you also get a massage that's about 6-7 minutes.  The nice surprise was that you also get a massage on your upper back and shoulder when you're sitting at the nails drying area.  Good service and clean salon but a bit pricey.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I love this nail salon! So beautiful inside with such a wide variety of beautiful nail creations. They can do it all here! I usually get gel manicure and a regular pedicure but I have also tried the dip and other services. Everyone here is so friendly and helpful! This is my favorite nail salon in St. Petersburg! They know how to wax Eyebrows very well!! Great for socializing & relaxing!
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The new owner was offering 20% off on any service, however she still has the previous owners working there.  My mani / pedi was done by the previous owner and after leaving a 50% tip and my bill showing the 20% discount I was charged the full price...guess 50% was not enough.  Four years of going only to Lee (she no longer works there) I will not be returning."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Stayed here for a night with a free room and asked if they had a complementary room and the put me in really awesome junior sweet! Loved it! Room was beyond what I expected! Will stay here again for sure. Only negative is the slots were not generous at all, but oh well. Next time I hope i can get upgraded to a Jacuzzi room with how much i lost hah"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Professional. Super responsive. Lots of polishes to choose from. I've never heard of the brands. No OPI or ESSIE. I don't know if that matters to anyone. My regular mani was ok. Manicures cost $15 but I paid $18. Not sure why. I'm thinking the $3 was for the gel used to mend a break on my natural nail. However, the gel didn't hold for more than 2 days. Pic below."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"It's been months since I've gone out anywhere, including La Chelé unfortunately due to this pandemic. I get Disport for esthetics as well as management of my migraines. I have been a nervous nelly to go out but I can not express enough how safe the entire staff made me feel. I only touched what I had to they had sanitizer everywhere ready to go. I can not thank them enough!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"i will never ever check in to atlantis's hotel in reno , nv. !!! the rudeness of staff in food venues & i am confused , the deceptively marketing in writing & avertisting material about hotel room amenities !!! well it finally hit me about last 07/07/2018 to 08/23/2018 minus 2 days 07/13/18 & 07/14/2018 that i forgot to post this !!! food has been great even room service food !!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Today I went in for a targus piercing.  I went to All Star because their piercer Trevor had so many great reviews.  I'm very happy I went there.  Trevor is awesome.  He's comforting and personable.  He's knowledgeable and thorough.  He's very easy to talk to, explains everything, and doesn't rush you.  If you ever want a piercing, you won't be disappointed with All Star."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Had never been to this salon before, but a friend wanted to meet here for a friend date so I got a gel manicure, it was $31. It took about 10 minutes and the results were beautiful. The interior of the salon was very spacious and classy looking, a very welcoming atmosphere and the people were friendly and professional although there was definitely a language barrier. Would return in the future!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I would highly recommend Dandelion and Spa!I went in for a pedicure and gel manicure.  The woman did a great job and was very nice.  The only reason I don't give it 4 stars is because it was a busy Saturday and I was waiting almost an hour.  I will go back to see them in the future
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Very cool place. I like that they have an online booking system. 

The massage therapists are very friendly. 

I've also had the 30 minute deep tissue massage and it was very relaxing.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I have not come here since.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Came here for the first time last week with my sister for a pedicure. We were seated immediately and we had a nice time. The pedicure was nice, but it was not worth the price.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,They were really nice but the place was very dirty. I saw people who were getting their nails done while doing nails.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Please see updated review for 2018.

OLD:
I arrived here just 45 minutes before close yesterday and was happily welcomed in and seated immediately. The salon is new, clean, and relaxing. Jackie was the one who did my pedicure, and he was excellent - so friendly and thorough! My toes looked perfect, and that is coming from a perfectionist such as myself! Would definitely recommend him and this salon. I look forward to returning."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Loveeeeee loveee love! My mom and I use to go all the time before I moved. All of the girls say hi and know your name when you walk in! My girl Tou is so sweet and threads my eyebrows like no other! Such a great atmosphere to get a mani or pedi. The prices are very reasonable even for being so close to the beach! I recommend this place to everyone!!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"After driving past this place a few dozen times, I finally stopped in today for a haircut around 9:00am. This seems like a good time to go as there were 2 people waiting (me included). The place has a cool atmosphere and the barbers are friendly. Angelo ended up cutting my hair and did a great job, I walked out feeling like a million bucks with an awesome fade. I'll be back."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,What a great refreshing experience and down to earth salon. Sylvia took me in on a last minute request and as a new client. I wanted a simple trim and long layers and she nailed it. Amazing conversation with a really genuine person. She has been there for over 25 years and clearly keeps clients flowing in for a reason. The price was great. She also sells wonderful smelling candles and melts!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Tried this nail salon when my old one went belly-up and it is part of the same chain. I got a very decent pedicure (with my own nail polish), was treated courteously, and the work was done very carefully. I enjoyed the nice setting, and found the experience to be just fine. At $27 for a simple pedi, it was a little pricier then I'm used to, but my nails look great."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I took a break from eyelash extensions for personal reasons... nothing to do with Clayton or his work. I came back yesterday and he did my lashes again. I love them! He is very meticulous, and asks questions to get to know what kind of look you want. I have already received compliments on my lashes. I recommend him to all my friends. Clayton is very approachable, kind, and a good listener."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I am extremely happy with my lashes! I had an appointment for a Lash Lift about a month ago and my eyelashes still have a beautiful curl to them! Gail was incredible. She made my Lash Lift process so relaxing and the results were amazing. It gave my normally straight eyelashes a natural curl, and the lash lift made my morning routine extremely easy and fast. I definitely plan on regularly returning!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I recently got my nails done for my graduation pictures and I'm so glad I went to Kim!

Thank you Kim for taking your time on my nails. It was a great experience!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I just moved to the area this week and was looking a bit rough as my family informed me!  So my uncle  came in for the cut and I came in for the DE-grizzly Adams !   I met with Laura, and welcomed me to her station.   On top of being a wonderful new face that I was introduced to, I found a great and talented barber."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I have experienced massages all around the world - Michelle (and her staff) are World Class!  Part of me wants to keep her a secret (so I don't have to fight for appointments), but that wouldn't be fair.   I would recommend you give them a chance, but be warned, you may never want to go anywhere else!  Three days till my next visit!  Two days too long!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"It's been years since I had fake nails and took the plunge.  Quick and good service.  While there decided on eyelashes extensions.  WOW!

This place has hair salon, pedicure, manicures, massages, waxing, facials, and all the beauty treatments in one place.  No parking issues or waiting."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"What a GREAT EXPERIENCE! These other yelpers dont know what they are talking about. If your looking for a great stylist, ask for Sonya!!!

I have finally found a home for my hair!!! Thank you Salon Addora!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"One never really looks forward to getting the hair ripped out of their lady parts, but my experience at the LunchBOX has me looking forward to my next appointment. Kaitlyn, my waxologist was very professional, super-duper friendly and made the whole experience very pleasant. The location is very convenient and there is plenty of easy parking. The salon looks super modern and is very clean. I would highly recommend LunchBOX Waxing Salon!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Wait...I never reviewed this place?! But they are my favorite nail place in SB - how inconsiderate of me. ;) They always do a great job on pedis and manis. They may not be the cheapest, but they aren't expensive either and are totally worth it.  Clean, efficient, and friendly - oh and have a VAST collection of colors (all beautifully organized, seriously amazing). Check them out; you won't be sorry!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,"They do a good job, but the quality is just not worth it. I got a full set done by the same lady. She was very rough, and didn't take her time. She was rushing and rushed.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Very different than what I'm used to at the nail salons in the past, I was pretty nervous.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,My nails turned out absolutely perfect. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the girl who did my nails didn't do a good job at all. I was very disappointed that they didn't look so good. I will not be going back.I've been coming here for about a year now and I can honestly say I never have a bad experience

She takes her time and is so meticulous.  I have never had a bad experience.  I have never had a bad manicure and I can't wait to come"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I loved the spa and atmosphere. The only complaint is that it's only a small salon and they do not have the spa chairs, which is fine, but the massages were pretty mediocre. They had no heated massage tables which was nice. I would come back again. Great salon with great service. I have been going to them for years."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I just went in for a fill and the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I had an acrylic set and the lady was very rough with my cuticles.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"When I got a full set on I mentioned to the tech that my middle finger was not even, as I was getting coffin shape and one side was more angled in than he other. She said to wait until she was finished because she still had filling to do. Well when she was done and put polish on the nail was still messed up. But the past 2 times have been better."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Kevin did my pedicure and acrylics! The experience was very nice, the interior was gorgeous and my mother and I were offered tea and coffee. Both Kevin and Hanna were very friendly, conversational and professional! My acrylics are perfect, Kevin cut them to the length I requested and shaped them too. He worked quickly and they came out very nicely! The place smells very very good also. Will definitely reccomend in the future!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I started going to Best Nails a month ago. This is the best nail salon in the area, and I have been to many. All were hurry up and pick your color and done and out, next! Not here, the owners are so friendly, calm and genuinely interested in what you want. It is clean, very nice atmosphere. This will be your only nail salon once you try it."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Great telehealth and in person experiences. I've seen Dr. Bird for both and she is excellent - thorough, professional and warm. All other staff were also courteous, friendly and helpful. Especially during COVID it can feel unnerving to go in for a doctor's appointment, but the whole office handled it seamlessly - I was the only one at check in and they sent me straight to a cleaned exam room. Great experience overall."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Great place to get a funky cut.  Anthony is the best...any time I've gone in there, I've told him to do ""whatever"" and I've come out with a rockin' cut.  More importantly, if I don't end up cutting my hair for months, the grow out looks great too. 

Friendly staff, cool decor, awesome products (just recently started carrying Bumble and Bumble...).  And decently priced for a haircut in the city."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My friend and I went here for some girl time based off the reviews and a recommendation from a friend and it was great!
The staff was really nice and accommodating.
We opted for a basic pedi, which included a complementary drink, massage chair, lotion massage, and hot stone massage, as well as the color of your choice. 
It was a very good deal for the price. 
The place was clean and spacious as well."

So I agreed to reschedule from a massage to a facial only to find out upon arrival that the therapist just quit. How can anyone run a business this way!  They will be out of business in no time."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"A Minds Eye Tattoo is by far the nicest tattoo shop I've ever stepped foot in - Very professional and clean atmosphere. And, all of the artists showcase incredible work!

I needed a cover-up tattoo and Kyle Miller was my artist. His great personality (along with talent) made him so easy to work with - fast too! When I left, not only did I leave with a perfect tattoo but an overall wonderful experience."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"just got dip powder ombré on my nails and I am in love. this place is honestly the best in the area. the owner and staff are so sweet and kind, as well as the salon being immaculate and clean. these negative reviews are inaccurate and senseless. probably written by ignorant people who have to much time on their hands. If you or know someone in the area I would 100 percent recommend!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I was in need of a proper haircut, since 2020 became- well, we all know how the story goes. .. REAL. Garrett knocked it out of the park!! He's incredibly kind, professional, beyond talented and truly listens to your coif concerns. For those of you who may be tender headed, he's quite gentle with your hair and scalp, as well. I would absolutely book your next appointment with Garrett! He's simply a magician."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I just moved into the area so I was looking for a barber shop. I can't really complain about this place. The only downside was the price. I paid around $35 which really isn't too bad considering the going rate for men's haircuts nowadays. I was happy with the end result. The hairdresser was very nice and didn't seem fake or forced. They even offered a beer or basically anything else to drink.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Some of the employees work so fast and don't even care how your nails turn out and it's really upsetting! I asked for long square with white gel polish (pictures included) and it was done in about 45 minutes. Almost every nail is poorly shaped and they didn't seem to care AT ALL! Spent over $100 for a gel pedicure and an acrylic full set and the final product wasn't worth the money.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I absolutely loved the service I received here! I just went in for a trim and they gave me a wash, perfect trim, and blow dried my hair straight (which is super time consuming so I really appreciated it). The ladies working were so nice and we all couldn't stop having amazing conversations the whole time! They even gave me a free deep conditioning coupon to use next time I go."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,Meg! Meg! Meg! She is amazing! The only person I've ever gone to that I trust with my hair. I had a bad cut before and she fixed it without a problem. I'm so happy I found her! She's a perfectionist!I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I went to Sarah yesterday and had the best experience. I came in for a full set and a pedicure. The place is very clean and the staff was so friendly. Sarah was so sweet and personable. She took her time and did a fantastic job. She took her time and was very sweet. I will definitely be going back!I had an excellent

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,My parents and I dropped by this place after we decided we needed a place to get our nails done. We had a great experience. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. We were greeted right away and were helped right away. The owner was very personable and did a great job on my nails.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I've been going to Cathy for a couple years now. I always leave happy and I'm always satisfied. If you want a great cut, this is the place to go. I go to her and she does an amazing job every time. I have been going to this salon for about 5 years. I have never had a bad experience."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This salon has one of the best salons in Reno.  

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  The salon itself is very nice and relaxing.  They offer complimentary drinks and even wine.  

The only negative I would have to say is that the woman who did my nails did a great job on my nails"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I set up an appointment for an hour massage and a pedicure for my daughter and myself. We arrived at the front desk, and were told that we could not take our appointment. We were told that we were not in a rush and that we were only in the salon for 5 minutes. We waited for 45 minutes and when we finally got up to leave the"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Not impressed. I went with a friend and she had a pedicure that didn't even last. I had to ask her to be careful with the cuticle cuticle cutting and it was painful. I told her that it was a bit painful but she just seemed to be talking about it and it was painful. I will not be going back.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"These guys are the best. They do the best job. I will keep going back!Very rude. I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. I was very pleased with the service and the price. However, the manicure was not very good. There was polish all over my skin and my nails were cut and bleeding."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"You have your occasional ""grunters"" here. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the front desk staff was very nice. But I feel like the manager needs to take care of her customers. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I have been to this salon twice now and I have to say I love the way it looks."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,The wait has always been long. The only reason I've waited is because of the wait time.I had an excellent experience here. I got the basic manicure and it was amazing. I came in with no problem with the shape of my nails but I got a gel manicure with tips. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The woman who did my nails
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I went there to get a fill and the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I had two nails that were crooked, and they were chipped after only a week. The place was clean and the girls were nice, but it was not worth the money. Great salon with great service. I have been going here for several years."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Dina is AMAZING! She provides a relaxing and relaxing massage. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same salon for over 10 years now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,The lady with the blue hair did a great job. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same stylist for many years now and she always does an amazing job. She takes her time and is very precise. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and it's always a pleasure to see her.I have been going to O
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,This is the best sports clips in the area. I will keep going back!Very rude. I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. I was very pleased with the service and the price. I'm a loyal customer for years and will continue to go here. I was looking for a place to get my nails done.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This place used to be 100% better. So decided to pop in on a Sunday for a mani pedi. I get that I didn't make an appointment but don't have me sit around for an hour and a half which was my mistake waiting. Then tell me my bad when I get up to leave. Lackluster customer service, especially with all the nail salons entering the neighborhood."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,This place does not follow state board. I've seen things that shouldn't have ever happened. Using tools without disinfecting them...And the whole business doesn't run properly either. You have an appointment and you come in but what is the point of having an appointment when you don't even get seen for an hour. I believe Henry is the one I've seen who never shows up on time. I think he's the owner. Very unprofessional.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,I had a friend come in town and had time to kill for a long layover and really needed to get a fill in. I normally go to a place in Kirkwood so I wanted to find something closer to the airport. I used Yelp to find this place and I must say I received the best manicure ever! My friend was very impressed with her fill in too. I will definitely go back!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Wildflowers is nothing short of amazing. I've been there several times and they never, I repeat NEVER fail to amaze me with their prompt, polite and professional service. Ok, I'm a man but we know we're all going to age, someday. Their line of fine Aveda products will complement the lifestyle of any refined gentleman. Bottom line, go there, give them a try and I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,I LOVE Laurens! I have no idea why there aren't more reviews here but honestly this is best salon ever- they have the most reasonable prices and its such a nice place- I live in DC but I come all the way home just for Elizabeth to do my highlights (she is so speedy and affordable)- i have been to so many salons in my life and I just keep coming back to Laurens!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"He's now started a new position as a Senior Stylist at EDGE SALON in Palo Alto, on University Avenue.  Gave me a fantastic layered blonde cut with heavy bangs, wisps around the neckline, and a bit of the inverted- A line so the weight of the sides flows into my cheekbones. Flawless and I've had compliments on it already!  Please ask for him at EDGE, he just started there Nov 1, 2009!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I just found my favorite new salon! This place is a hidden gem. Unlike most salons in the area all the equipment here is brand new and very stylish. They have a huge selection of colors to choose from in both gel and regular colors. The technicians are skilled, friendly and fast and prices are great. I got a refill, cut down and design with gems for only $20."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I took my daughter to Krystal and she did the best job on her curls we went short and my daughter couldn't be happier. Krystal also teaches you how to do your hair while she is doing it for you. Love her.  

I went back to get my hair colored and cut and she did an amazing job I am really happy and will defiantly go back. Everyone their is happy and friendly."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"My new favorite nail spas. This place is a hidden gem. My go to spot when in tampa. The place is clean luxurious and the nail techs are beyond amazing. My nails were done fast and well. They didn't break and the designs were to die for. 

I found this on an off chance but if you need a new place to go as a new comer to tampa, you can't go wrong here"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Everyone at Cool Springs Plastic Surgery is incredible! I have personally seen Heather, Destiny & Emily for different services and love them all! When I expressed to Emily that I had trouble with botox helping my crows feet in the past she took extra time to study my face and came up with a plan and it worked out wonderfully! I am so incredibly pleased! I would recommend Cool Springs Plastic Surgery to anyone!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Visiting from out of town, my friend and I called ahead of time to make an appointment to both get our nails done. We show up on time, and are told to wait.......we seat ourselves, 35 minutes pass by without even being acknowledged once! There were a couple employees that seemed to be wandering around, walked by us and looked at us a multiple times, but said nothing to us. We finally just left."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,Horrible experience. Came in for a fill. I was cut to the point of bleeding while he buzzed my cuticles. When I mentioned that he was cutting me he said nothing and continued. I was charged $3 extra for trimming my nails down. The total fill cost me $19 while their full set price was $20. They are not people friendly and they rush through the process and they up charge everything.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been patronizing this salon for over a year. I followed my hair designer here from Montecito. I don't mind driving here from Montecito because he is worth it. I have been going to Edde for over 13 years. He is amazing. My hair is very thin but somehow his expert cutting makes it look thick.  He is wonderful with color also.   This salon is cozy, quiet and low key."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been going to h20 for my basic gel manicure for the past 3 months. They are usually able to get me in the same day that I call for an appointment. The salon is incredibly clean/organized/and just plain cute. The ladies that work here are exceptionally nice and the customer service on each trip has been great. 
Overall I highly recommend H20, especially if you're looking for quality service without killing your wallet."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Well... she's horrible she gave me chunky orange highlights. I went to her on a whim bc her reviews were good but I regret it. She was rushing the whole service and didn't let the bleach sit for long enough. I even asked for a shadow root and she didn't do that. I messaged her to try to resolve this and she blocked me. So don't go to her it's a waste of money.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I always get my nails done here and they always do a great job! They have a great selection of gel polish and the people are always friendly and the atmosphere is so relaxed and relaxing. I have had acrylic nails done here and they always look perfect! I always get compliments on them! Highly recommend. I have been going to this place for over 3 years.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Just got my nails done here a couple weeks ago and I will never go anywhere else! They are so friendly and the prices are great. I get the gel manicure and it's so worth it.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Who doesn't love the feel of an old school barber shop? 

The shop has a cool vibe.  The people there are friendly and the shop is clean.  There's a nice shop in the back of the shop that is open 24 hours a week.  The barber chairs are great too. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I just left harmonia beauty school and I am very disappointed. My first visit to this salon was to get a full set of nails, and they said the gel polish would take 4 days to come off. I waited in the pedicure chair for about 20 minutes to be seen.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Just had the BEST Hydrofacial ever. The space is very calming and relaxing. The entire staff is very knowledgeable and professional. The front desk is also very helpful and welcoming. The front desk is always so friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Ok so I went back and asked the girl who did my nails if she could fix them and they said yes.  The lady who did my nails seemed annoyed and said it was fine but it was obvious she was in a hurry to do my nails.  I asked if she could fix them and she said no.  I will never go back and I will never recommend
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I went to see them last week and they were amazing! My nails look beautiful! I got a gel manicure and a pedicure and they were both so nice and professional!

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Haven't been here in about a year and a half. I came in for a gel fill and pedicure. The technician was very nice and the shop was clean. The massage chairs were comfy and the paint job was good. My nails look great. The only thing I would change is the nail color.

Relaxing atmosphere, flat screen TV's, good quality chairs. My nail tech was great too! Very sweet and made sure everything she did was exactly to my liking. She didn't try to sell me a ton of extra services either which was nice because I hate when they do. Anyway, my nails look perfect!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Candice, did an amazing job on my God-daughter's hair! She was quick, reasonably priced, and her quality of work was surpassed my expectations! She's also very flexible in terms of scheduling last minute appointments. I will definitely use her again!!!

She's not a big user on Yelp but she has a website that lists her prices, style menu, and you can book directly online and view her availability. She makes it so easy for her customers!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"So... this was my second time there.

I LOVE my hair CUT. I asked for layers and they look amazing... however... I decided to get color too & deeply regret it. I wanted a low-light that looked natural... I provided a picture and all.

What I ended up with were huge brown stripes, I look like a brown and black zebra. Very disheartening because I trusted my stylist was going to be honest about his coloring experience."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I just took my toddler who absolutely hates haircuts here to have his hair cut for his 2nd birthday! Even though he was fidgety and cried a bit, they were all understanding and nice about it. The woman who cut his hair was absolutely wonderful. She was friendly, patient and she did an amazing job. My son no longer has a bowl cut and he looks adorable. I'll definitely take him back here for sure."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My experience was great, pedicure was relaxing, good chairs, very nice people. The problem is the gel did not last 1 week... see pictures. I was supposed to get a totally different color too and the person who did my nails did not know how to use the magnet to get the right effect. I was visiting, so won't be back, but just so you know before you spend the money, it will not last."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"The only place I go for waxing in Philadelphia. Everyone is so genuine and sweet. She takes her time on waxing and pays attention to detail. I always leave feeling satisfied and happy after sharing wonderful conversations with the owner. Her prices are very reasonable. Schedule your wax in advance and take the hour of your day to give back to yourself when you visit this clean and relaxing spa. 

Also, I love her decor!!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Ashlen is so amazing! First of all, she is the sweetest, most kind, caring person! Second, she is a true artist and perfectionist with her eyebrow microblading! I am so happy with my brows! She really has such an eye for doing this, and is so professional and thorough. I have seen other people's microblading results from other estheticians and it doesn't compare to Ashlen. She is THE BEST OF THE BEST! Thank you, Ashlen!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"One of the many Chinese foot massage places that seem to have sprung up in New Orleans. My feet were tired and hurting from stupidly walking way to far in heels two nights before, so I treated myself to a 30 minute reflexology foot massage. It was lovely--nice and quiet, relaxing, and refreshing. The masseuse was skilled and applied the right amount of pressure. If they had these up in Pittsburgh, I'd be there weekly!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I cannot say enough about Sun! I have NEVER had a haircut like I did today. He is a master of the trade. I asked him what he felt would look best. He took time before he washed my hair (which was a great experience as well) to look at my hair and face and discuss options. It was great! I love the haircut and have already scheduled my next appointment! I HIGHLY recommend Sun!
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I am new to this area and also this was my first experience with getting eyelash extensions and can I say ""WOW!""
I absolutely LOVE the result!!  I can sincerely say that Niven is a beautifully, talented artist!  I'm so thrilled to have found Artistic Beauty Med Spa on Groupon.  I will recommend this spa to everyone!  Thanks again to Niven for making my eyes stand out without the need for mascara!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been here twice for dip manicures and both experiences have been great. I came as a walk in and they sat me down immediately! The woman who did my nails didn't have a name tag, but she was really sweet and made sure I was happy with everything. The dip manicure was only $45 when I payed in cash because they offer a 10% discount when you use cash. Will definitely be coming back."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I visited during a trip last September to NOLA and absolutely loved this place. We did a couples massage and the staff was so kind and thoughtful. Also, my massage therapist pointed out a couple of bad habits of mine, too much salt, leaning to one direction when driving, etc., which was amazing! I couldn't believe how much she could tell by working me over. I left feeling refreshed and VERY happy! I'll be back!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I got an 1 1/2 hour introductory priced massage last week with Valerie.  The place is clean & pleasant.  The staff was very nice.  The massage was great.  I expected a hard sell for a membership afterwards, but I didn't get one. I'm thinking of signing up though.  If you want a massage every month, it seems like a fairly good deal if you don't have insurance covering your massages."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Haven't gotten a trim in years and was totally unfamiliar with the salons in the area. Randomly chose Pure Salon and I'm so glad I did! Katie did an amazing job. I came in with dead, bleached ends, thinking I was going to have to get a serious cut, but I left with a good amount of my length. Even my old dye job looked way better, without any adjustment to the color."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I stopped in and had virtually no wait. A man gave me a gel manicure and rather than doing my nails the way I asked, file and NOT clip them, he clipped all my off all my length and rounded all my nails. He was rough and while filing he actually cut 3 cuticles because of the angle of the file. I will say, the polish was done well however, I won't ever go back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Been meaning to write this review for the last year. I came here for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I was seen within 5 minutes. The place is very clean and everyone was friendly. The only thing I would change is the color selection. I was given a color wheel to choose from for my manicure and I had to choose one.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,This place looked highly rated and has the best massage chairs I have ever had. I was seated immediately and given a very comfortable massage chair. The massage was very relaxing and the masseuse was very professional. I will be back in a few weeks for another massage.I have had several massages from this place. I've been to several locations over the years and this is by
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Massage addict gives you the best massages. 

I have tried a few other massage therapists here and have had a lot of massages but have never been disappointed. 

The front desk staff is very helpful and helpful. They are always very friendly and helpful. The massage therapists are very professional and know their stuff. I can't wait to go back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I capitalized on a Groupon and booked the appointment online. I arrived around 5:50pm and was immediately seen. The front desk girl was very friendly and offered me a drink. The place was clean and quiet. I was offered a beverage as I waited for my appointment. I was taken to a chair and given a massage.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,It's pretty amazing that 3 of us had an appointment. I will definitely be back!Very rude. I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. I was very pleased with the service and the price. The nail tech was very nice but I felt she was rushing. I felt like she rushed through the manicure and did not have the proper time to do
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I absolutely LOVE this place, especially for the fact that they're open on Sundays. I go every 2 weeks and have had a great experience every time. The atmosphere is so relaxed and relaxing. I have had manicures and pedicures from multiple technicians. This is my favorite place for a gel manicure and pedicure.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Amazing salon and lovely staff! 

I highly recommend this salon. I have been to multiple salons before finding the right stylist.

I go to Cindy and she is great.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I get my lashes done here. The owner is very knowledgeable about her business and the customer service. I always have the best experience here. The lash extensions are always on point and it's worth the wait. It's a very relaxing experience. I would recommend this place to anyone!I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Absolutely terrible.  I have pedicures often and this was by far the worst I've had in Nashville.  The technician had a bad attitude, barely gave me a basic pedicure and was extremely sloppy.  In addition to her poor job, the tub was skeptical and there were dirty tools lying around (actual skin of other people's feet).  It was gross enough where I should have just left.  I will never go back."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I went to this place yesterday to get my hair cut and I HATE the way it turned out. The stylist didn't even ask what I had wanted and when I told her, she did it without any sense of preciseness. When I said a light blow dry, she didn't even dry my hair at all, she just dried it for 5 seconds. Overall, the price was low, but you definitely get what you pay for."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I went to Shannon for my first haircut in over a year (due to the pandemic). My hair was so long and caveman-like. Shannon gave me a transformation cut and I've gone back ever since. My friend from out of town saw me today and he said, ""your hair looks nice, what the hell."" I've received complements from friends, co-workers and even strangers. This is all new and unusual for me. It's all thanks to Shannon."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Terrible experience with the girl working this day named Kelsie who for some reason tried sticking me in the lowest bed they have while I pay for the next level only to attempt to sell me on the fact they are the same thing. 
I left confused why I even pay for the next tier as she has her mask off while she's with a customer at the counter.
Likely to cancel or lower my plans level"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I've been coming to this salon for years and I know all of the technicians are good but I will only see Aaron! He takes the time to learn how each customer likes their nails done and remembers each time you come in. When I get my nails done by Aaron, they never break or lift. I drive all the way from Lake Mary, FL (1.5 hours) to get my nails done by him!!! Thank you!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I like quality products. I enjoy supporting local businesses. Brick & Mortar Barber Shop combines these two very well. The atmosphere is cool and casual, the barbers are friendly and knowledgeable, and at the end of the visit you leave with one of, if not the, best haircuts you've ever had. Marcus was my barber, I sat down and told him to do what he thought would look best, and I wasn't disappointed. I'll be back."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,The staff is friendlyAnd always greets with a smile. Never had an issue with the locker room or the   Restroom. The machines are fantastic I just wish there was more weights such as dumbbells maybe up to 100 pounds same with the barbells and easy curl bars. I know some of this is contract stuff with Planet Fitness corporate but overall I have a good work out I'm always treated nicely and with respect.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was looking for a new nail salon & found City Nails based on recommendations from my fellow Yelpers.  They didn't steer me wrong. City Nails is the best nail salon I've been to in Indy.  The service is awesome, the place is really clean and they are very detail oriented with pedicures & manicures.  They don't rush you in & out like many others.  

I highly recommend checking City Nails out."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"My hair is thick, course and wavy/curly depending on the weather.  Emily navigated the sheer volume of it all with such style! I opted to go shorter, and she tamed my wild mane into a very stylish and feminine pompadour, appropriate for both my desk job and art life. I have gotten compliments from strangers on the street!  I would definitely recommend Head Area (and in particular Emily) to anyone looking for good style."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"If I could leave negative stars, I would. I've never had such a negative experience at a European wax center before this. I had an appointment at 9:15, for which I arrive on time for. I was waiting for over 30 minutes and ended up leaving to go somewhere else. The utter lack of professionalism and display of disrespect for their clients' time was appalling. Do not waste your time making an appointment at this location."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,I visited Verve for the first time yesterday; what a hidden gem right in my neighborhood! I was greeted warmly and offered a drink right away (yay for midday wine). Amanda did my nails and was fun to talk to and did a great job. She gave me tips to make my manicure last and didn't rush me at all even though I was the last customer of the day. I look forward to going back!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"First I have to say they do a great job on nails. But everyone needs to know that on top of the 35.00 they charge for a full set (that's reasonable), they charge 20.00 more for any kind of shape (I.e. almond, coffin) THATS MORE than a manicure!!!!! Lesson learned , ASK before you get your nails done. Every place I have ever gone to, only charges me 5.00 extra for my nails to be shaped."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I've been coming to this location for the last 10 years.  I always receive excellent service and the owner is always very accommodating.  I also get the gel manicure and it's always worth the money.  I've been a loyal customer for years and always receive compliments on my nails.  I've also gotten the dip powder manicures and the pedicures are always
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I am very disappointed that this place is so close to my home. I have been to multiple different places before finding this one. The first time I went was okay. The second time was okay. I went in for a pedicure and manicure and was still waiting for about 5 minutes. The woman was very rude and I felt very uncomfortable and uncomfortable with her.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"So in my last post, I had an appointment at 11:30 for a gel fill and pedicure. The technician, I believe is the manager, was very kind and made sure to take care of me. The shop was clean and everyone was very friendly. The woman who did my nails did a great job on my nails."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Kim's nails are the best! I love the way they look and they make my nails look awesome.I had an excellent experience here! I got the basic gel manicure and it was so worth it. The salon was very clean, they had a huge selection of colors and they have a huge selection of colors to choose from. I got the dip powder and it was so much"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Yeimy is awesome!!!! She takes her time and does a great job. She also makes sure to make sure she's done the best nails for you. The salon itself is so cute and relaxing. I highly recommend this salon. I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. I always get a great haircut at the same time.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"The smells. 

Just come for the prices, you get a good deal. If you're looking for a new salon, this is the place. 

I think the place is pretty nice, and it's convenient to be in a strip mall.I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous, but the owner made me feel"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Had my first deva cut here. The owner, Nancy, did a great job! I'm very pleased with the cut and the cut. 

I'll be back in a few weeks!I went in to get a gel manicure. I was charged $45 which was the price I paid at my previous salon. I went back to the salon to get them red"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Awesome experience and great cut. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a haircut.I had a great experience at this salon! I got a great cut and color by Lauren. She was very sweet and professional. I will definitely be back!The salon is clean and the staff is very friendly! I've been getting my nails done by a different person"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I've gone to a couple other places and they're all good. 

The only reason I'm giving them a 3 instead of 4 is because the manicure was subpar. The color selection is limited and the cuticles were cut short. This was my first time getting a gel manicure. I was a bit disappointed because I had to wait 30 minutes for my manic"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I visited Nashville over the weekend for the first time. I saw a lot of reviews and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I had a very relaxing massage with Amanda and it was amazing! I will definitely be back! I highly recommend Amanda and her entire staff.I love this place! I've been getting my nails done by Anna for over 10
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I did not have an appointment. The woman who did my pedicure did a decent job. I had a very bad experience, but they did have a decent selection of colors. The place was clean and quiet. The pedicure was fine. I don't think I would return.I had a great experience at Salon A.  I made an appointment for a color and"

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,Today was my first time here. The woman who did my nails did a great job! She was very friendly and the place was clean. The pedicure was nice too.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I absolutely love this place!! As a massage therapist myself Sunrise is a great spa to spend a couple of hours having me feet massaged, then laying on a warm table for a wonderful massage!! The therapist there are well trained and do a great job!! The only drawback is the language barrier.  I have to explain as best as I can what type of massage I want, but regardless the massage is always a treat!!!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,If it weren't for Amber and her magic I don't know what I would do!! I had an absolutely horrific experience with some extensions from a prior salon and Amber fixed my hair (aka pulled the worst tape in extensions of my life out of my hair for 2 hours) and gave me the best cut!!! Her dedication and passion for her clients and for her career radiate. I would give her 100 stars if I could.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I've been coming here for at least 2 years and the service has been decent. Today I came here to get a mani/pedi and I was in a lot of pain. My nails are fairly short because I pick them and I was scolded for doing so. Also the woman made my nails bleed in several different spots. It caused a lot of discomfort and doesn't even look that nice. Very disappointed with my visit here today.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I thought I was ready to bleach my own hair, I watched you tube videos for weeks!!! I was wrong! 1-800-hot hair help line??!!! Maison de Cheveux to the rescue! Thank the hair gods for all of these wonderful people! Brittany took my orange busted hair to perfect platinum! It took all day long but worth every minute!!! I'll be back for sure! If you think you are ready, just call the experts at Maison de Cheveux!!!!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Unfortunately, I had a horrible experience here.  I came in for a manicure appointment and needed the powder polish removed (it had been applied there).  The woman who removed it used an electric drill that she clearly did not know how to use.  My nails are very damaged and will take 6 to 8 months to grow back.   The actual manicure she gave me was crooked and the clear polish unevenly applied."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Made an appointment for 2, My friend got seen while I sat in the water for 45 minutes waiting before I left without service. To add insult to injury they kept apologising to my friend about the inconvenience and not to me. No offer to  reschedule with or without a discount. Could not be more upset that my nails will not be done for my trip and will steer anyone I know AWAY from La Moda"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Great therapists to fit every level of need, whether for gentle relaxation or physical healing and therapy. The front office staff are very in-tune to which therapist to recommend for the clients' needs. Friendly staff. Easy to make appointments, gentle reminders, the perfect amount of communication from the staff, and always a great experience. I also love the membership program, and that I can use it for gift cards or share with other members of my family."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,Best pedicure in a very long time! I had a older lady I'd never saw before and she took her time with my feet and i left a new woman with new happy feet! I'm so happy I stopped in. I've been here before and usually get good service. The owner is just outspoken and opinionated so i can see how it can come off as rude to some. I love it and the selection of polish!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"The cut was great and the price was great as well! He understood exactly what I wanted and made it look nice. :) The shop was clean, close to the LRT, and has wifi. Everyone was friendly and the scheduling was the next day with no problems, and finished in half an hour even though I had a ton of unruly hair. Highly recommened, one of the best cuts I've ever had. Will definitely come back again!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Just went in today for a pedicure. Tammy was by herself & was busy. I sat & waited for her to be finished with the lady ahead of me. Tammy started to work on me , i had to have her stop, she was going to use the tools she was using from the lady ahead of me.  As I looked the nail clippers we rusted. I DO NOT recommend going & will not go back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I recently got my hair cut short for the first time in several years and as a guy I always have a hard time finding a trustworthy establishment. I was referred to Crimson and Becky not only gave me the best haircut I've ever gotten, but truly listened and understood what hair style I was aiming for. I wrote this review to speak from a guys perspective and to say this place is definitely worth checking out."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I visited The Bronzing Studio for the first time about three weeks ago! I was looking for a local place to get eyelash extensions and I'm so happy I found Evelyn! She did an amazing job with my classic full set and I can't wait to go back for my refill. Her studio is really cute and very comfortable for a two hour service! I highly recommend going to Evelyn if you're looking for quality lash extensions.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I absolutely love this place! I moved into Philly and asked some coworkers for recommendations and at least 5 or 6 suggested Talking Headz. The new location is huge and has kind of a garage/grunge feel with all of the same great stylists and salon cat.

I always go to see Kali, she is so considerate and skilled. I've had two drastic haircuts by her and both have come out awesome, and for $26 you can't beat it."
Beauty & Spas,1.5,CG,"The worst shop! It's just a bunch of guys and they don't listen to you! I just wanted a simple trim and a trim, and they're the worst. I was in and out in 45 minutes and the result is ridiculous.I've been going to see Kim for almost 3 years now. She is amazing! I go to her every two weeks and I'm so happy"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Always a wonderful experience. It's an easy and relaxing experience for a first time visit. I'm always greeted by name and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I'm always in and out in less than an hour. I'm always on time for my appointments and I always leave feeling refreshed and refreshed. I have also seen the owner, Nicole, and she is a great stylist"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I'm all about a good-priced haircut. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I'm not a fan of the phone calls, but they're the only ones in town I go to.I had an excellent experience at Salon Nails. I had a gel manicure and pedicure. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The woman who did my nails was"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,Brittain has been doing my hair for the last 10 years. She is a master of color. She always listens to my ideas and makes suggestions that are not to my liking. She is extremely personable and very professional. I have never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a haircut. I highly recommend her. She is a true professional.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"For a 27 dollar pedicure, it was the worst. I will never come back. I will never go back. Also, they're over priced, so you get what you pay for. Oh, and they don't have a lot of color selection. I had a gel manicure, and it started chipping within 3 days."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Roy Jones at Mary and her staff are the best. I will never go anywhere else!I've been going to the same stylist for many years now and have never had a bad cut. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my haircut. I have also gotten my hair cut by Joe and he is a perfectionist.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Despite my bad experience on the phone, the girl at the front desk was very apologetic and gave me a discount. The place is clean and the staff was friendly. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because it was one of the most expensive places I've ever been to. I'll be going back for sure.I have been going to Oggi for a"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,this was a very good time. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the front desk staff was very nice. The office is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I came in to get a full set of acrylics. I was charged $45 which was a little steep. I was also charged $5 extra for the shape of my nails.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I have been there twice now and I am very pleased with the results. The salon is clean and the staff is very friendly. The salon is very modern and clean. The prices are very reasonable. I have been to many salons and this one is by far the best. I also love the fact that they have the most convenient hours. I have had pedicures and manicures
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,I would give 0 stars if I could. I went in for a simple gel manicure and the woman doing it had a bad attitude. I asked her if she could take it off and she said yes. It was clear she was annoyed about it. I asked for a gel manicure and a gel pedicure and she just brushed it off and didn't start working on the gel
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I've been going to Scout's for a couple years now. I always love my hair cut and color. I always have the best experience with both Heather and the rest of the staff.I have been going to this salon for a few years now.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I must say I am sups impressed with this salon! Very friendly and welcoming. Wonderful conversation and relaxing atmosphere. I took advantage of a rare opportunity in my crazy hectic schedule, professional and personal, and treated myself to a mani / pedi and... had driven by this place several times since their opening and wanted to check it out! Soooo I did and... AWWWESOME I am so in-love!!! I WILL be spreading the word on this lil gem!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"The gentleman who did my full set today was kind, gentle, and very careful with the application. My nails came out perfect! He took his time making sure both hands were the same length and shape and cleaned up even the smallest bits of gel on my fingers. I was able to make a same-day appointment, was greeted upon arrival, and was sat a good distance from the other customers which I appreciated a lot."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Love this massage place! It's incredibly affordable no muss no fuss type of massage place. $30 for 1 hour massage and $45 for 90 minutes which is like half the cost of other massage places. The place is clean, simple, and comfortable. The massage itself was great and staff/massage therapist was friendly. They take credit cards and you can place the tip on the card for additional $2 I believe."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I have been going to Integrity to see Kiel Ferrari for a few years now. I have to say that this shop is, by far the best that I have ever experienced. They are professional, organized and very, very talented. The shop is spotless and the staff is awesome. I would like to rate Kiel and Integrity 10 stars, but Yelp only allows 5. Stop in, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Small salon opened about a year ago.  Went there for the first time today for a hair cut.  Walked in when it opened (Sunday 9:30am) and only needed to wait 5 minutes.  Shampoo, hair cut and shoulder massage, all for $15; seems like a pretty good deal.  The owner and the stylists are Chinese, but they do speak good English; the other customer there was having a good conversation with them at the time."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Juna is the best place to get your lashes done, I've bounced back and forth between different places for years now but I always come back here! When I go to other salons my lashes fall out fast and I've always thought it was my fault, but whenever my lashes are done at Juna I have amazing retention. Also, I've only ever gone to the junior stylists so I can't imagine how amazing the senior stylists' work is!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I can only apologize for not writing this review sooner. I have been going to Crimson since they opened a few years ago, following Jeanine the owner from where she worked before and I wouldn't think of going anyplace else. beautiful, soothing surroundings, quality products, fun things to shop for, but most of all Jeanine's caring touch and exquisite treatments. I have had facials, massages, lots of (gentle!) waxing and always the best of care! Be back soon!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Had went in for a pretty big change. Went from long hair to short. The haircut took maybe 30 min and my hair was completely butchered. I had shown multiple photos a a straight bob, with no layers and had verbally mention i wanted a blunt bob. Extremely disappointed with my hair cut with Holly. There isn't much i can do now that it's already short. Probably not the best salon choice, I would not recommend this salon."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Love this place! And love Kayleigh.  As soon as you walk in you are warmly greeted everybody is so sweet and interacts with you.  Kayleigh was my waxer. This was my first visit and first time waxing and she made the process so comfortable. She explained everything and is so nice! Now with the actual wax I am beyond impressed by the results. I will definitely become a regular here and recommend this place to everyone.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Precision Microblading is very professional and in a comfortable environment. Camille micro-bladed my brows and I couldn't be happier with the outcome! I truly felt at ease and knew my outcome would be to my liking. Camille is truly an artist and is very knowledgeable. I highly recommend seeing her for all your permanent makeup and microblading needs! I can't say enough good things... The office is sanitized, clean, uncluttered and comfortable. This service was worth every penny!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Great massages and their membership is affordable and conveniently month to month. There is one woman who works at the front desk who is not very nice, however. She wasn't very helpful or nice on the phone when trying to find a replacement massage therapist for the one we see regularly (Anita, the best, went back to school). Kind of a big deal, she should have been more helpful. The others who work the front desk are great."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"This place is very clean, and has a great vibe. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same stylist for many years now and she does a fantastic job.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I recently moved to the area and I was looking for a new salon for my hair. I came across this salon through the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I moved to Westchase 4 years ago and was very disappointed. My first visit to the salon was a haircut and color. The stylist was very friendly, and the salon was very clean.

Upon returning for my regular waxing services I walked into what felt like new and updated atmosphere with beautiful new shelving and front desk area! This place is always catering to it's customers.  All of their products were organized in a way to encourage patrons to take a look and ask questions, this makes for stress free shopping and happy customers. Well done pia! Extra stars all day!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Showed up with my 95 year old father 10 minutes BEFORE 5:30 pm the listed closing time.  The woman inside of the locker door said that they were closed because they had had a ""really busy day"".

Business must be really good to turn down a customer.

Went to J's further down Old Capitol Trail, who closes at 6pm and they were really happy to see us.

We will be returning there, Tom's you had your chance and you blew it."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"COME HERE! Got my nails done by Michelle and she is amazing. I walked in and even though she wasn't planning on taking more clients for the day, she still took me. I was treated so well because she is so passionate about what she does and took the time to make sure my nails were perfect. Michelle is an angel and knows exactly what she is doing and won't let you leave until your nails are on point."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Visited here for a facia and 90 minute deep tissue massage, enjoyed the entire experience.  Charlott gave one of the best massages I ever had and special yes to her foot massage, unbelievable!! The pressure for the massage was perfect.  I stayed in the same room for my facial by Anaiayh, she was very informative and answered all my questions about my face and gave great recommendations and tips. 
I am looking forward to my next visit."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"100% recommend
Kaitlin W did my hair today and I absolutely love the cut! She started with a great consultation. I wasn't exactly sure how I wanted my bangs but after a conversation, I completely trusted her expertise in finding something perfectly suited to flatter my face shape and my needs. And she delivered! 
In addition to a great deal for being a first-timer ($40 whaaaat), they also gave me a coupon for my next cut."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I love Noire. Kevin is my guy. I've gone to him for the last six months or so and I could not be happier. My nails last. They don't chip or break. I can go three weeks in between and they're perfect. They always look amazing. I usually get dip. But I've also had him do ombré! 

I accidentally broke one at work and they let me come in and fixed it for me. I highly highly recommend It!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"After living in Tampa for a year I finally found a nail salon that I am super happy with. One of the best jobs I've ever had. I had a relaxing pedicure and had the powder dip for a simple and elegant pink and white natural and gel polish for toes. It's quiet with soft and serene music and lighting. I will definitely return and feel confident this will be my new ""go to"". Worthy of writing a review"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I enjoyed my massage experience. It's a habit to try spas while away from home. I rated this a four - only because of where I've been in the world. But definitely check this place out when in Nola. The prices are right. I had a late check in, so I was not privileged to the amenities on the spa floor (steam room, showers, etc.) it's something I look for when rating quality - but maybe you'll be luckier!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This place gets worse every time I go.  I am local and visit the hotel for other reasons frequently.  When compared, for example, to Safety Harbor Spa it is no where near as good for the prices.  Were it 50% less expensive I would recommend it.  For massage, I have had way better treatments in other spas or using the Soothe App.   For facials my go to is at Salty Roots in DTSP."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Carolyn is a gem! I was visiting for a salon convention a couple weeks ago and needed to have my old gel nails redone. From the start Carolyn was warm and helpful. This was on January 12th and they're still going strong on the 25th! She even helped me pick a better regular polish match for my pedicure. If you want to be blown away by excellent service, great conversation and an all around pampering time, ask for Carolyn!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I live close to the salon and have been going there for a few years. Ariana, the manager always welcomes you with a smile and is very diligent making sure you are not kept waiting. The ladies who work there are very professional and take pride in their work.  I enjoy going there for manicure and pedicure. Their prices are reasonable and they take precautions to ensure everyone's safety. Highly recommended if you're looking for a nail place."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Occasionally I stray to other salons, and I'm always so disappointed when I go elsewhere. This is the only place for me. Just perfect. Gels last for ages, and the price is right. Sometimes the wait time is annoying, but again, I've never seen it be better anywhere else. Love Alex and everybody else, though I miss Julia with a fiery passion - somehow when she did my gels they'd last 3+ weeks. Ah well, I'll settle for 2!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"YES! I came into see Gene for a massage and was so satisfied with the positive energy, touch, knowledge of the body and the over all feeling of relaxation. I left walking on a cloud and the feeling of calmness lasted for days. The music was great.  I do alot of yoga and this touch also helped my practice. I highly recommend visiting Lambertville Massage Therapy, they are awesome! Don't look any further, you'll be in good hands."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've been to a handful of places around town for Dysport/Botox and have had mixed results, so I was thrilled when I found Skinjectables. Every time there are consistent results. They're professional, well trained, and I've never had any issues with any ""botched"" jobs. They have a ""happy hour"" the third Tuesday & Thursday of the month for even better rates (it's already very reasonable). I love the B12 shots, too. All around great job for a great price!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I recently moved to Old City and I was looking for a new salon for my hair. I came across this salon through the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. The salon was beautiful and the staff was very friendly. I had a great experience. The salon is a bit small but I didn't have to wait long and was taken right away.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,Best pedicure ever!! The woman who did my pedicure did a great job! I will definitely be back!  The place is clean and the staff is friendly. Great place!

The staff was very friendly and I was very impressed with
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I got my haircut at this place and the girl who did it did a great job! She was fast and precise. The place is clean and the staff was friendly. The only thing that I didn't like was that the lady who did my hair cut her own hair. She was also rushing. I didn't know the difference between a wash and blow dry. I've had bad experiences with my
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,This girl is awesome. I go to her every two weeks for a Brazilian wax. She does a great job and I always leave feeling so relaxed and rejuvenated. I'm a very picky person and I always leave with a smile on my face. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"So impressed with this salon! 

I went in for a cut and color and was immediately seated.  The salon is very clean and modern looking, and the staff is very friendly.  They offer complimentary drinks and even wine.

The salon itself is so beautifully decorated and the staff are so friendly. I have been a loyal customer for years and will continue to return!I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I walked in at 11am and asked if they had anyone available. The guy who answered said he was running late.  I waited for him to get started and he finally came in and started taking off my acrylic nails.  I sat there for about 10 minutes and he was still not ready to take me.  I finally told him I had to wait 30 minutes for him to finish. 
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I have been coming here for a couple years now. I always love my nails! I just got a gel manicure and I am always very happy with the results. The staff is very friendly and professional. I highly recommend this place!I have been going to this nail salon for years and have never had a bad experience. I have had many different technicians and they all seem to take their time
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This place is always top notch. The owner, Nancy, is always so kind and personable. I always have the best experience there. 

I have had a lot of bad experiences here and this is one of the best salons I have been to. I have never been disappointed. 

The salon is always clean and the staff are always friendly. I love that I can"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Wow - why haven't I been here in years?  I will admit that I have been a customer here for over a year.  I have never had a bad experience.  The massage therapists are great and the location is convenient.  I have tried several different therapists and they have all been excellent.  I have tried several therapists and all have been great.  I like the location and
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Service has fallen off big time! Came in for a cut, empty barber chairs with barbers just talking on cell phones or with each other. all of them stated they had appointments coming so couldn't cut me. Waited over an hour still none of them offered to cut or seemed not willing to make some money nor gain new clientele. Unless you know a barber personally from here I recommend finding a better spot. damn shame cause I used to like this location."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Jon p has done the 3 most recents tattoos I have as well as my husbands most recent 2 tattoos. Everyone in the shop is kind, friendly, fun and professional. They play amazing music and have an absolutely perfect view of midtown. It's a super fun atmosphere. They are also right across from the chapel bar so you can have a nice pre cocktail before your session. Jon does simply great, thorough, amazing work! I would never go anywhere else."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I had a great experience at the color room! I have seen Aryka twice and both times she did an excellent job making my hair blonder with natural looking seamless highlights. As my roots grew out my hair continues to look natural and seamless even after months. (If I could afford it I would go more often) Check out her Instagram: @arykamichellehair to see lots of photos of the hair she's done! 
Thank you Aryka I will be coming back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been wanting to get my nose pierced as long as I can remember and finally decided to just go for it. JT was absolutely amazing, he walked me through everything, even explaining how all of the tools were cleaned, etc. He was so calm which made me feel 10x more comfortable with the whole experience. The piercing itself took not even 2 minutes and barely hurt. I couldn't have asked for a better first piercing experience."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Excellent pedicure! This was my first visit to TN and I had a great experience. I made my appointment for a classic spa pedicure ($28) online and was texted back that my appointment was confirmed. I liked the ease of booking an appointment but will call next time to request Kelly (unable to select nail tech online). I was treated kindly at TN and my nails look great! I'm happy I've found a quality place to get my nails done.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I like getting my hair cut here. I get anxiety at fancy salons and always feel that I have to talk and I'm not good enough to sit in that chair even though money is money. 

I always love my hair when I walk out of here. I like my stylist, Hedron. She is down to earth and doesn't make me feel stupid.  You can walk in or make an appointment online or by phone. Prices are very reasonable."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Not sure why the other yelper had a bad experience.. I have had great interactions thus far . Everyone is very friendly and great upon check in. Is it expensive ? Yes, but it is comparable to other laser hair removal services that actually work. I have dealt with laser removal services that only stunt hair growth..They also provide you with about $300 worth of creams oils and exfoliaters which are awesome.. I can't wait to see the end results!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,I had a 90 minute Thai massage by mie-mie.  This was one of the best treatments I have ever had. She is a very skillful Thai massage therapist. My legs were very tight from recent biking and she applied the right amount of pressure to relieve the tension.  My legs feel great!!  The facilities are very nice and the experience was wonderful.  The aroma and atmosphere make the experience very relaxing!!  I will be back!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"i was very nervous about getting my nails done again because the 1st time i got them done they started coming off about a week & 1/2 later. didn't even have my nails for 2weeks before they just started coming off. so i did go again to jenny idania's nails in sparks,nv she was just amazing!!!  she did a very amazing & fantastic job on my nails. i won't go to anybody else anymore but to jenny!!!! thanks jenny"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I took my nieces in for a pedicure and let me just say.. I'll definitely be coming back. Their massage chairs are the best in town (they can literally massage your butt and thighs) and they have so many pedicure options! Anna did an amazing job on toes, especially since it's been MONTHS since I had a pedicure. The whole place was clean and tidy and I loved their water feature. They're a new place but I definitely recommend it."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,First time a barber was able to cut my sons hair. This place was so busy. Seems the guys have a good following here. This was the first time I went to a barber and was happy with my sons hair cut. He is now 7 and over the years we've been to so many different barber shops. I'm glad to finally find a place to take him and know that the results will make me and my son happy.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Saw Michelle today, she did a root color with hilights & a great haircut for me today.  I was super happy with the atmosphere & it's apparent that Niceey loves her job working with the girls & training them.  I worked at a high end salon for years & was a little hesitant to go to a school, but I know Paul Mitchell The School Tampa is really doing it the right way!  

Thank you again Michelle!!"
Beauty & Spas,1.0,CG,I've been coming to this location for the last 10 years. I always receive excellent service and the owner is always very accommodating. I also get the gel manicure and it's always worth the money. I've been a loyal customer for years and always receive compliments on my nails. I've also gotten the dip powder manicures and the pedicures are always great.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Great location. I brought my daughter here and she loved her pedicure! The salon was clean and the staff was very friendly. The pedicure was very relaxing. The massages were amazing. I will definitely be back. I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was a walk-in, but I was not greeted at all."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,This was my 1st visit here. The woman who did my pedicure did a great job. She took her time and did a great job. The salon is clean and very relaxing. I will definitely come back. I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. I always get a great haircut from the ladies and I can't wait to try out their other services.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I followed Mallory from another salon. I am very picky about who cuts my hair and she is a true perfectionist! I am so glad she opened her own salon. I will definitely be going back to her in the future!I absolutely love this salon! I have had several different people do my hair for years and I always leave feeling great! They are very talented and take their time to
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,KELSEY is amazing! She was able to make me feel comfortable and at ease! I would recommend her to anyone!I had a fabulous experience at this salon!

Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,Took off of work three days later and the polish is already peeling off. I went back to get them fixed and they told me they can't do a pedicure. I was so upset and embarrassed. I will never go back. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was looking for a place to get my nails done. I came here for the first time.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,If I could give negative stars I would. I went in for a simple pedicure and the woman doing it had a bad attitude. I asked her if she could take me and she said yes. I waited in the pedicure chair for about 20 minutes while the lady who was doing my nails started with another client. I waited another 10 minutes while I was still sitting in the chair.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Mimi's is an amazing place. The owner, Nancy, is very kind and the salon is very clean. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. The pedicure is excellent. I will be back. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,Ugh cannot get ENOUGH of this place. I will admit that I have been a customer here for years. The front desk staff is always friendly and welcoming. The massages are amazing. I have been to many massage places and this one is by far the best. The entire staff is very friendly and helpful. I have had the membership and it is a great deal.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Patrice hooked me up with a blow dry and blowout for my wedding! I would highly recommend her. She was very accommodating and flexible. I have had great experiences with blowouts and style and she did a great job on my hair. I will be back soon!I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"One of the worst dips I have ever had. Not only did they charge me for the dip powder, but they also charged me for a manicure that was not even a full set. I was so embarrassed and in tears I will never be coming back.I've been coming here for about a year now and I can honestly say I never have a bad experience. I've had two different ladies do"

I will definitely be back!I have been a loyal customer of this salon for years.  I have never been disappointed.  I always receive compliments on my nails and my nails.  I will continue to patronize this salon.  I've also seen several different nail tech
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Best massage treatment I've ever had. The owner, Nancy, is very kind and makes sure you are comfortable. I had a massage from both Heather and the manager, Jenny, were both very professional and attentive to my needs. I will definitely be back!I had a wonderful experience at the salon. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Brendon cut my 14yr olds hair. The cut was just what he wanted and he was very patient. He listened to what I wanted and gave me some great suggestions. He was very patient with him and made sure we were on the same page. He is very professional and gives great tips on how to take care of your hair. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great haircut
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I went to the CWE Ladue Nails on Lindell for the first time on 12/2/19.  Lupe did my powder dip nails at that time and did an excellent job!  I went back today 1/2/20 for another powder dip manicure with Lupe.  Except for the outgrow my 12/2 manicure still looked great!  The best powder dip I have ever had -- Lupe is the bomb!!!  I am so very impressed and have found my forever nail salon!!
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've been a loyal customer for many years and it is because I continue to love my treatments. Today Lilly did an incredible job on my sore muscles by focusing on the ""needs attention"" areas. She does this with a smile on her face! 

I feel the studio is clean and neat. I appreciate that they start appointments on time. I love that they have many options. I will be back in March and have already booked my appointment! Thanks Lilly!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,The woman who did my nails was fast but her quality was not there my gel manicure chipped within two days. And when I went to pay she didn't seem too happy about me wanting to pay with a credit card and tipping on the credit card. I think if the company wants to not accept credit cards tips just post it somewhere. Overall they may do a good job for regular nails but not gel I will not be returning.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Sugaring is a unique kind of new Brazilian wax. 
They rub the goo looking stuff against the hair and then pull with the hair. 
It's almost like if you got a section of your hair just plucked all at once - that's what it feels like. 
I wouldn't say better than wax but I wouldn't say worse... kind of just depends. 
I'll update on the irritation and grow back in the next few weeks!
I love the decor inside. Very friendly staff."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Driving up, the place looks like a hole in the wall, but inside is a cute, well kept salon. I walked in without an appointment and was seen right away. Kim did a great job on my toes. She knows every spot to hit on your feet and calves to relax them.  The hot rock massage was an added bonus. Also had my brows done. I think they look great!! I think I've found my new go to nail place."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,Jessie is incredible!  I've lived in middle TN for 27 years & this is the first time I've ever been to a hairstylist who makes me feel like I'm leaving with a better style than I even imagined! She did tape extensions on my hair & I'm absolutely in love with them!  I get constant compliments & no one even realizes I'm wearing extensions. She's a perfectionist & this is definitely her calling. She's the holy grail of hairstylists!
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I went in on a humid hot day with my hair like a birds nest. The stylist was extremely patient, professional, poised. I'll get her name and post it here, I forget what it is. Ambiance is much more elegant than other drybar salons. I've been having my hair done at blow out salons every several weeks for at least 5 years all across the country. NYC, LA, SF, Philly. This was one of the best blow out experiences I've had."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"This is a review for the one located by JC Penney.  Do not go there!  I am a very specific person and I told them the length/thickness and shape was perfect and that I only needed to clean up the stray hairs-the older woman practically took my full eyebrows off!  They are super thin, super arched and the actual length if the hair was trimmed by more than 1/2!  I was in shock when I left-be warned!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I was greeted promptly which was nice but I have to say there is definitely a language barrier.  I could not understand the lady talking to me nor do I think she could understand me.  I had a full set of acrylics put on and most of them popped off within a week.  Very disappointed as I was hoping to find a new nail salon in my neighborhood. Everyone was nice but I will not be going back.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"First negative was no liners for the tub for our pedicures. The next thing was I asked the man not to massage my legs and focus on my feet as they ache from standIng on them all day. He proceeded the do my legs and then watch tv while ""massaging my feet"" which a two year old could have done a better  job. Lastly, the paint job, was not good including paint on my skin. We will not be back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Modern Men is the place to go for a great haircut. I've had the pleasure of getting my hair done by Raquel and she is awesome! For the price, you won't find a better atmosphere and better people than what you'll get at Modern Men. Plus, you get a complimentary beer or bourbon. How can you say no to that? Do yourself a favor and check out Modern Men. I guarantee you'll leave happy and looking forward to your next haircut."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Hector gives the best massages. He is very intuitive and knows exactly what spots need extra attention. I had tingling in my hands and feet for 5 weeks. I went to a doctor, had lots of blood work , nothing indicated what the problem could be. One 90 minutes massage with Hector and the tingling went away. He knew trigger points to concentrate on. Besides being healing he also gives a full body massage that makes me melt into his table."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,So we knew it being a holiday weekend it would be busy so we didn't mind the wait. There is a young lady that works here that is super nice once we went back to get our pedicures it went downhill from there. We were not greeted the water was cold and the techs had an attitude. The service was not good and customer service was worse. It was as if they hated their jobs.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,My first deep tissue massage and it was amazing. I made the appointment last minute and was stoked they could get me in the same day I called. I lift weights and do a lot of strength training and I never thought about going for a deep tissue massage to aid in recovery. Now this is going to be part of my regular routine. This place is great and the location is super convenient. Plenty of parking is also a plus.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"Stop is very dirty and looks dirty. 

I will not be going back. 

I am very disappointed.I've been coming to this nail salon for years and have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and the service is excellent. The salon is always clean. I have never had to wait long and have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my appointment."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Cure Hair Salon is a beautiful place, with lots of talented stylists, and the salon is always clean and neat. The owner, Rose, is the sweetest person you'll meet. She's extremely personable and very personable. I have had several stylists and they all know how to cut hair. I highly recommend them.I have been going to Oggi for a couple of years"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I have a massive amount of hair and want to try something new. I have been to multiple hair salons in the area and have always been pleased with the results. The staff is very friendly and professional. I highly recommend this salon. I have been going to this salon for about 5 years. I have never had a bad experience. The salon is clean and has great music playing.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I saw Ruth for a brow tint and tint and she was amazing. I have very thick brows and she was very thorough. The process took about 20 minutes, which is okay, but it was worth it. She even took a shower and placed a special moisturizer on my brows. I will definitely be going back!I went in to get a pedicure and the guy who did my ped"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,My girlfriend recommended this place and I'm so glad I did. The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. The staff was very nice and professional. The salon is in a large shopping center. I was greeted immediately and given a complimentary drink. I was offered a beverage and a glass of water while I was waiting.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Terrible! Nails were bumpy and uneven. The paint job was sloppy and poorly done. She was rude.I had an appointment with Melissa, and she was the sweetest person I've ever met. She was so helpful in explaining what she was doing. My eyebrows look great and I'm definitely going to be coming back to her! I'm very happy with my brows!I love this"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I'm so embarrassed. Got them done here and they look like I did them myself. I'm just so embarrassed. I had a fabulous experience at this salon! I got a great cut and color by Lauren and it was amazing! I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this salon!I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"This has been my go-to nail salon since I was a kid, and I have never been disappointed. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating, and the place is very clean. I have had acrylic nails done here a few times and have never had a bad experience. The only downside is that they have a huge selection of nail polish, and they are always busy!I have been here twice now"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"After my last stylist at another salon, she was just too lazy to make my hair look the way I wanted.  The front desk girl told me that if I had a problem with the color, I would be able to make it right.  I was very happy with the results.  I will definitely be going back and will tell all my friends about it.  I also made an appointment for"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I took my Mom for her first visit. We both loved it. The staff was friendly and we had a great conversation. The salon is beautiful and the atmosphere is so relaxed. The massage chairs are awesome and the massage chairs are perfect. I wish I could get my nails done at the salon a lot closer to home!They are amazing!! I have been to a lot of nail salons and this one
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"As an avid nail salon, I always come here. I always leave happy and satisfied. I have had a lot of compliments on my nails and pedicures. This is definitely the best salon in Tucson. I will always recommend them. I always get compliments on my nails and pedicures! I will keep coming back. I have been to this location twice now."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"For just a regular mani, it's $45. Not including a tip! So I gave them another shot and they had a great selection. I got a gel manicure and regular pedicure. The lady who did my pedicure was very thorough and did a great job. She did a great job and I'm very happy with the results."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Nicholas was my barber and he did a great job. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same place for over a year now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and they always look so great.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Shame on me for not checking yelp before I went to the salon! Was in a hurry and needed my nails done, thought this would be convenient since it was walking distance from my hotel.

The worst manicure I've ever gotten in my life! A gentleman at the salon did my nails, they were lumpy, uneven, The acrylic on my nails is so thick that as I dress they snag my clothes.

Hit the stars by mistake this shop caught 0 stars from me!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Tomac is awesome!!! I got my 4th tat here while my 2 friends from SB  got their 1st.  We all loved his work.  We were referred here by a friend that has gotten multiple ink jobs done by Tomac.  I will hands-down drive the 2 hours to SB from OC just so Tomac can ink me up some more.  He's that worth it!  He definitely has artistic talent and his shop is super clean and chill.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Been going to this place for years even after moving out of the neighborhood over two years ago. I could literally walk around the corner of my street and get my do' done there but won't even try a new place because I love this spot. This is an old fashioned barbershop with no nonsense bells or frills. I'm not interested in an ""experience"", just looking to get the hairs well cut,pay 'em, tip 'em and go. They deliver and they're great."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This nail salon's quality largely depends on who you get. There are a few ladies that I absolutely adore and do a wonderful job and the nails last a long time! Sadly, last time I went I had someone else and the quality of my manicure was quite poor. There was polish all over my finger tips and cuticles she didnt even bother cleaning up. Up until then this had been my favorite nail salon in Indy so it was super disappointing!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"A girlfriend and I arrived to our appointment, we were quickly seated for our ""spa day"". I tried the dip nails for the first time, and I am SO pleased with the process and outcome. The staff was very friendly- even though they were so busy! The salon is VERY clean, a major plus to enjoying a manicure. I will be visiting again once it's time! Thank you for a lovely experience Bliss Nails - it's even in the name! Pure bliss!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"This gym is better than their Affton location but they have many of the same problems:  malfunctioning monitors, audio connections so worn plugs wont hold on cardio equipment, rude employees that don't greet you or make eye contact, dirty bathrooms, exercise studio closed for over a month and counting for a new floor with no sign of progress last time we were there...Fortunately, there are some new gyms like Edge that just opened in St Louis so we finally have alternatives!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Lilly's is a pretty safe choice to go with when it comes to nail salons. I would definitely recommend scheduling an appointment otherwise you'll be waiting for a while. The techs are pretty nice. If you're coming to just get a basic polish done then this is the place, but if you're looking to get designs or something else I'd try a different salon.  The prices are reasonable. Lilly's has become my new go-to salon--been going there since May of 2021!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I went in here to get my first set if acrylic nails for my daughter's wedding.  I was impressed by all the pics of stunningly beautiful nails done by Chi.  I showed her a pic of what I liked and let her do her thing.  She was fantastic and absolutely mesmerizing to watch.  My daughter was so impressed she went to Chi for her wedding nails the next day.  Needless to say we are extremely happy customers!!!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"This was a great experience. Ideal is the only place in Tucson that uses real, professional nurses for your treatment and also uses the only lasers I know of that will actually rid you of unwanted hair for GOOD. Why spend $300 to have it all grow back? Sales consultant was professional and discreet. No need to go back for laser as my hair is fine but considering cool sculpting or fillers. Excellent service from front desk to treatment."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love Salon 90!! I've been coming here the past 2 years for haircuts and highlights. Cynthia is fantastic -- she does a beautiful job with the cut and color, listening to exactly what I want! She's also friendly and fun to talk to.

The salon has a relaxing atmosphere, and the clients are served tea while they wait. It's easy to make an appointment and lots of parking is available nearby. If you need a haircut or color, I'd definitely recommend here!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been going here for many years and have never left dissatisfied. Every employee is excellent and the married Owners are a delight. Recently started using Super Gel and love it so much more than powder. It lasts longer (and I'm very active outside, go to gym, use computer etc), there is more of a color variety, it takes less time to take off and put on, and my nails are more healthy and strong than when I used powder."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Our normal spot in Lionville was closed yesterday, so we took a chance on Happy Nails Spa.  We'll definitely be back!  The spa is large, clean and nicely decorated.  I loved that they used a liner for the pedicure tubs, and that we were offered a cold beverage.  The pedicurists took their time and made sure to ask if we were comfortable multiple times.  The price was a bit higher than our normal place, but worth it."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Normally never ever complain, but this owner was down right rude for no apparent reason.  The place was filthy, the technician did not speak one bit of English to communicate, and they ripped me off with pricing for service that was not rendered.  No top coat, no lotion, no hot towel treatment.
Tried to charge me the price of a manicure just to trim my cuticles, after already charging me $32 for a fill!!!  Total Tip off and Rude!!

Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"Excellent service with kind and friendly staff.  I've been a customer for a couple of years.  I have had facials, waxing, and hair extensions.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"This place is a rip-off. 

I paid $45 for a simple pedicure and a gel manicure. The technician cut my cuticles, and didn't even say a word to me. 

I'm not from the area, and I was in desperate need of a pedicure. I will never go back.I have been to a lot of nail salons in"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I come to K Nails regularly. The quality of work is always consistent and the salon is always clean. If you are looking for a new nail salon, you should go see Lea.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I loved this place until today. The woman who did my nails did a sloppy job and the paint job was sloppy. The nails look terrible and the paint job was sloppy. I will not be going back. It was a waste of money.I have been to this salon twice now and I am very satisfied with both the services and the results.

I have had a lot of pedicures and manicures and my nails"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I've never had any massage here. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the massage therapists are so nice. The front desk girl is very nice and welcoming. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the massage itself was a little too slow. I was given a full body massage. I was also given a 20 minute hot stone massage while I was being massaged.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"While it wasn't the best experience, I thought it would be a nice place for a relaxing massage.

I had a great experience.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The place was clean and quiet.  I will return.I have been to this salon twice now and I am very pleased with both services. I have had my nails done by a different tech each time and my nails have"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I just moved to town and have been looking for a good nail salon for a while. I came across this place and I am so glad I did. I was very impressed by the customer service and the quality of work. I was greeted with a smile and asked what I needed. I was offered a beverage and a glass of water while I was being serviced.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Friendly, excellent, reasonable prices, very clean and professional. I will be back!Very rude. I had an appointment and I waited 15 min before the man who was doing my nails was ready to take me. He cut me 3 times and when he was done I was bleeding. I had a gel manicure and the color I chose was old and didn't even come out."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Wondering about this online check-in, I made an appointment online. When I arrived, the front desk staff was very friendly. The office is located on a busy street, and it's very clean. The staff was very professional. My appointment was for 11:30am and was seen at 11:45am. I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment time."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"It's become a 2-3 star joint of late. The service is too inconsistent. You roll the dice every time you come here. One day you get a good pedi, another day you get a crappy one, along with a half ass foot massage. 

I get the feeling that they care less when you decline the alternate deluxe pedicure that they offer at the start of your session. I've given Vo Nails more than a fair shot. Time to find a new nail salon."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Went in to get a color/cut/lip waxed and I am so impressed! My old stylist just couldn't get the cut or color I wanted down, and I lived in fear that I'd never find a stylist to make my hair fantasies come true. I absolutely L.O.V.E!!! the friendly vibe in here, almost like an episide of cheers. Kaitlyn was exceptional and is a hair wizard, and Maria waxed all my problems away (from my lip). I will be returning every 4-6 weeks!!!!! ~~~~~"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been walking past this storefront for weeks waiting for its grand opening and was absolutely blown away. The staff is so friendly--you are greeted with smiles and offered a complimentary wine, coffee, tea, or water. The space is bright, fun and energetic. Their nail color options are beautiful and extensive. They did not skimp on time or quality--I am so happy with how my gels turned out and the service I received. Would recommend without reservation and will be going regularly!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I give this place a 1 star for the customer service. The person who calls to confirm the appointments is extremely rude and would not allow me to make another appointment without a credit card on file and when I refused to leave a card she blocked me from making future appointments. I do have other choices on where I can spend my money and I don't mind spending it other places. Good quality service is what I'm used to and expect always.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"This place has had new management since May/June 2012. So I would ignore all the reviews before that. 

I have been here several times since and enjoyed each visit. The salon is clean and the girls are meticulous. On my last trip- the girl who did my nails was very attentive. The massage was the best part. I also got a hot stone massage. Apparently it comes with every pedi. Mani/pedi ws $40. Pretty standard across the country.

I'm very happy with the result!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"out of all the nail salons i could've chose, i decided that La Bella Nails is the best in my opinion. Others may argue that the workers are overwhelmed and that the polish is horrible, however no matter what its a great experience. They provide water, makes sure your eyebrows are beautiful, and leaving your nails healthy and pretty. Additionally, the massages are to die for. The various of nail polishes are colorful, different, and mostly expensive to buy. Definitely fucking worth it."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,I just quit the club after three years as a member.  The locker rooms and filthy showers just never were cleaned!  My family still goes.   My husband said the Men's lockers were recently renovated. The classes were either for super Fit or Super Old people. Unfortunately I'm in my 40's in the middle.  I have taken up trampolining at Sky Zone - I'll do that for awhile and only visit the Healthplex for Lisa's amazing Vitamin C facials!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,So glad this shop opened up on the beach! I work nearby and this shop is so convenient to stop in and get a quick fill after work. Johnny always goes above and beyond to make his customers feel at home in the shop. The entire staff is very friendly and happy to service you. AND if your feeling a little stressed they always off a glass of wine to relax you while you are having your nails or pedicure done.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I am a barber and came to check out Nic Grooming while on vacation on recommendations from a fellow barber.  I had the pleasure of having Kallie as my Barber. She is very talented!! Her scissor work was fantastic and left my fade flawless and created lots of texture on the top. As far as the beard trim it looked good, but sadly they don't preform straight razor finishes or hot towels. Regardless I would trust her with your hair or beard."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"My roommate & I went here to see Jessica for our nipple piercings and it was a great experience. The shop is very clean, everything is sanitized, and everyone is professional. Jessica made us feel comfortable & prepared us for our piercings using helpful breathing exercises. She was also very knowledgeable on the proper sizes of our jewelry as well. I will always be going back to see Jessica for any new piercings or for some top-notch jewelry at Heritage Tattoos and Piercings."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Everyone that works here is super rad! Super friendly, super nice people, and all the artists are amazing. All different styles so if you flip through their art books and portfolios and are looking for a certain style, you'll find something you'll like. The shoppe itself is so nice, really clean, tidy, and a beautiful facility. And it's located in a really nice part of town, there's a fancy pizza place across the way, a couple bars and It's above Recycled Records."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Located on Olive Blvd. across the street from LuLu's Restaurant. Saw sign for one hour foot massage $35. then checked all the excellent ratings on Yelp. The massage was excellent and long. Very thorough and deep massage. a little intense but healthy. My first time here but won't be the last. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Owner was English spoken. Not a fancy business but more than makes up for it with charm. Try it.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"So sad. This was my first visit and I had higher expectations. Very little scrubbing or exfoliating in the pedicure. Almost no massage. The gel polish was done perfectly and that is the reason for three stars. There was no clipping or filing. My nails were buffed a little but left the length and shape that I came in with. 
However I was impressed with the amount of cleaning that was going on around the salon in the hour that I was there."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Resa and Jessica are so nice and professional. I've been going to them for about a year now and they always do a great job.  The salon is clean and the staff is so friendly.  They are open on Sundays which is a nice touch.  I recommend coming here if you're looking for a quick and professional mani/pedi.  I've also seen Jessica for my nails and she
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone!I've been going to this salon since they opened. I had a great experience. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This place now has multiple locations. The only one I've tried is for a gel manicure. I've had the same technician for over 10 years, and she does a fantastic job. She's extremely friendly and does a great job on my nails. I always get compliments on my nails and my nails. I love the color selection, the attention to detail is excellent, and the prices are very reasonable."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I love this place. I go to the same girl every two weeks. All of the girls are very nice and the prices are reasonable. I also get the gel manicure.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I never appreciated my curly hair. The last time I went in I had a very curly hair. I had long layers and I hated it. My hair was long and it was curly so it was difficult to style. I went in for a trim and I got a trim. The first lady was very sweet but I didn't get the shampoo. I didn't like how she cut it and my hair looked very curly
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I came here for my first tattoo and the experience was amazing. 

The shop is very clean and the artists are very friendly.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I hate having my hair cut.  I will procrastinate as long as possible before I will go in.  That all changed when a friend recommended Deluxe.  She has been going to Deluxe for years and recommended I go see Mary.  Thank goodness she did!  Mary listened to what I wanted and every time I left there my hair was perfect!  Thank you Mary!!  I would highly recommend this salon to anyone who wants a quality hair cut!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"My experience at GLO Nail Bar has been nothing short of amazing, professional, and peaceful. Everyone here is so friendly while being well knowledgeable of the nail profession. I enjoy the diverse atmosphere as well as the very clean and cozy environment. I normally NEVER write reviews but I felt this was important to share because it's literally the best nail salon that I've been to and I highly recommend others to try it out. I guarantee, this will be your new ""nail place""."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Went for my first visit yesterday. It's in the new shopping center across from Target on Ridge Pike. Salon was clean, & cute. Everyone was very nice. I talked to the owner but didn't get her name. She was very personable & sweet. I got a pedicure. It was very relaxing and my feet & toe nails look awesome. She did a great job. It did take an entire hour to do. I'm sure she'll get faster with experience. I'll definitely be going back."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Dropped in for my first visit this afternoon. Great experience. from the friendly and prompt greeting when I walked in. to the pedicure itself. A beverage was offered (I chose red wine) and I was shown to a comfy massage chair after making my nail color selection from a wide variety of polish colors. The gentleman giving the pedicure was terrific. even going back and checking the cuticles and nails after my foot/leg massage. As I said. great experience.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I go to Helen at Hollywood II for my pedicures and let me tell you, she does the BEST PEDICURE EVER!  Most of the time, I get a French pedi, and it lasts every bit of two weeks.  I had to go out of town and I went to another nail salon that was closer, and my pedicure chipped after like 4 days.  Next time I'll just make sure that I'm able to get in to see Helen before I leave."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,My nails ended up looking good but I'll never go back. They don't give accurate pricing info as you go. quoted one price then added more for the polish I chose at the end but failed to mention the price would go up as I was choosing and actually promoted the polish that would be more. was stabbed with her sharp thumbnail throughout the whole manicure which didn't stop even when I said it was hurting. Just no overall respect for the customer.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"The staff is really friendly but the lashes do not last at all! I went to Lashes deal Sol twice, the first time I went the lashes only lasted 3 days, I called and told them that and they did a refill with their ""strongest glue"" but they still charged me the full price and again, the lashes did not last. 

The friendly staff is the only reason I would go back but it's not worth the money to get your lashes done here."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I had done my research and looked around and this place had the best reviews so I booked an appointment. Janet fit me in despite my distance and busy schedule. She is very good at what she does and very professional and friendly! She will talk you through your first time. The results are amazing!! I live in the country so I drive an hour and 10 to get to her but it's worth it!! I can't wait til my next appointment thanks Janet!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"calling the Dr.'s office s such a pain... i never can talk to someone directly.  I did have a nurse call me back however she was quite rude.  Maybe she was having an 'off' day, but i didn't appreciate her tone or her answers to my questions.  

Even though Dr. Mancini has said i can 'call and talk to her whenever' i have yet to talk to her directly.  I am always talking to a nurse about my skin issues."
Beauty & Spas,1.0,OR,"This was the worse nail salon I have ever been to... Me and my best friend went there to get Valentine's Day cute acrylic nails. Well, for one they were rude... Didn't speak a word. Very rough with the hands and made me bleed from being so rough. Our manicures turned out to horrible that we had to go to a different salon in order to get our nails fixed and looking normal again. I wouldn't have my worse enemy come to creative nails."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"It's no surprise that this place has consistent 5-star reviews. The entire staff that we encountered was amazing (probably 4-5 women total). We popped in for a manicure but they were super busy (again, no surprise) so they got us penciled in and we headed out for a drink. When we returned they were again amazing, offering us water or mimosas, and generally making sure we were comfortable. The manicures themselves were awesome, super happy atmosphere, just a fun time all around."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"They treat you like crap when you come here and there's always a long wait. After waiting in a pedicure chair today for 30 minutes I'm not coming back. The owner tried to push my feet into scalding water and laughed when I pulled them out. 

The women assigned to me walked over to me with a bowl of food she was eating to show me why she was not working on me. 

I'd rather pay a few dollars more and be treated well."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been to this shop several times over the last few years, I have never been so happy with the work I had done on my arms , all the artists there are very professional and talk to you like a friend, so my comfort level was at ease while getting my tattoo(s), I would recommend this place to anyone thinking of a first tattoo or their 100th. and I have. I always carry some of their business cards with me, just in case."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place is cleaner than a doctor's office. After searching around for a place to get my first tattoo, asking everyone I saw with beautiful ink and reading TONS of reviews, I settled on Electric Ladyland. I was very pleased with the service I got. They were able to fit me into their schedule as a walk in--no problem!  I felt very comfortable here and the staff was very professional. I reccomend this place to all my friends and cannot imagine going somewhere else."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Being new to the area, my best friend and I simply plucked this salon off the Internet based on its reviews. And boy are we happy we did! We both look at least 10 years younger after our facials, and my skin has not been this happy since I moved to Florida two years ago. We both got exactly what we wanted, which ironically was two very different types of facials.  We are both planning on coming back soon to continue rejuvenating our skin!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,I went to Christi because she does my cheer coach's hair and it always looks cute. She put new highlights in my hair because I have not had them done in a long time. She also put brown streaks in to make my blond steaks stand out more. She is really nice and fun and my hair looks exactly like I want it to. She just did my friend's curls for prom and they turned out soooo cute. I think you should go there too!
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"One of my regular massage therapists moved from the West Location to the South so I started going there just to see her. Kaitlin R. is great and I enjoy the more specialized massages she is very capable at. 

It is nice and the only reason why I don't give a 5 star rating is simply because I find the West Location more spacious, pleasant and modern. The South location feels a little cramped even if there are only 2 people in the waiting room."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Great service! I was looking for an affordable salon that was friendly and easily accessible and I found exactly what I was looking for. My hair is pretty straight forward but David gave me excellent suggestions that ended up looking fantastic. I was skeptical at first because prices were so much lower than other salons around the area, but Coastland offers high-level service (shampoo, massage, cut) with an extremely affordable price tag! Have already recommended to multiple friends and am looking forward to future visits!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"My friend and I went there last night and got an hour massage. Both of our masseuse's stank of cigarettes and then in the end complained about our 30% tip! They actually were yelling at us and then took out other people's receipts and showed us a higher tips? I have worked in the service industry my entire life and tip very well. This was astounding to us both. We over tipped for a mediocre massage and then we're tip shamed? Ridiculous, never going back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place was heaven on earth! I came here and got ""the works"" facial experience. It was amazing!!! I was so relaxed, from the moment you walk in you are treated like royalty, I totally felt like I was in a fancy resort far away from home instead of at a spa right in my backyard. Float has a very kind and attentive staff, I highly recommend coming here for a solo treat your self day or with some girlfriends for a fun spa day!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Best place in town to get your eyebrows threaded. Everyone who works there really takes their time to make sure it comes out perfect. I've been going for over a year now and I'm really happy with the shape my eyebrows have become. Even before Covid she was very clean and sanitized before each client. Now she cleans her hands and each chair before and after a client sits down. I'm so thankful that they're still open and my brows look great no matter what!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,One of the challenges of moving to a new city is to find a good barber. I recently moved to Philadelphia from New York and needed a haircut. I did not want to drive all the way back to NY for a cut so I decided to try out South Street Barbers. It was a great decision. The environment is friendly and welcoming. Will Mack (owner & barber) greeted me at the door and did a great job. Perfect and crisp shape ups and cuts.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I was always a strip guy when it came to Reno, but for a change of pace and the ratings that this place give you - its unbeatable. 

To this day I have never paid for a room or a meal here, also great gambling comps. 

Rooms are a hidden gems here - the most Vegas Like rooms in RENo - Flat screens, well ventilated etc. 

Biggest cons are the location and the mirros - they are very disorienting. 

Good gambling for the most part"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I wish I lived closer, but I wouldn't drive all the way to my regular salon. The owner is not very friendly. She needs to get her hair cut more often.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and always get a great experience. "

I received a great pedi and my nails look amazing."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Completely thrilled with the color and cut I received.  I will definitely be back!Very rude. I had an appointment and I waited 15 min before the man who was doing my nails was ready to take me. I walked in and they were busy but I was still waiting. The man who did my nails was very rude and I felt uncomfortable. I was told to come back later because I was getting a pedicure
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I stayed for a gel manicure and pedicure. My first visit was for a pedicure and I had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. The only complaint I had was that they were not busy. I had to wait almost an hour and a half to get a manicure and pedicure and it was a little over an hour and a half.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Worst nail job i've ever had. The paint job was sloppy and poorly done. She was rude.I had an appointment with Melissa, and she was the sweetest person I've ever met.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I am a local and go to the same nail salon for a pedicure. I just moved here from NY and was looking for a good nail salon. This place is close to my house and I found them. I'm a loyal customer for years and always get compliments on my nails. They do a great job and it's a very relaxing atmosphere. I think they also do a good job on my nails.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,Highly recommend Anna Armstrong. She is an amazing artist and a talented artist. I have a hard time finding a stylist that can cut my hair and she is the one to go to! The salon is beautiful and the staff is so friendly. I have been going to this salon for about 5 years. I have never had a bad experience. The salon is clean and has great music playing.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've seen several people over an 8 year period that Jessie worked on. Her artwork is amazing,clean lines,careful attention to detail. She is very clean and sanitary--first and foremost. She has done an armor sleeve for my left arm and is in the process of completing a dragon sleeve for my right arm. I get compliments on my tattoos - literally- everyday. I'm able to get an appointment with her at least once a month-if not more often. I cannot say enough great things about Jessie."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,Best barber shop that we had ever been to. Took the bf and my son and they did and amazing job. I wish I would have gotten the names of the guys who did there cuts. I Highly recommend this place for guys and even boys who want a fresh up to date cut with people who know how to do fades. Place was chill with some ragae in the background. They even had a pool table and Xbox while you wait.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I have been getting dip nails for a while now. Attempted to try a new place. That day when I went home one chipped. I have never seen dip nails Chip  It's been a week three chipped on the side and I had to file them on an angle my pointer finger nail cracked (the polish and my entire nail came off. Then later in the day opposite hand my ring finger. I am beyond upset. I have perfect long nails not I have shards
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"We ordered an in home massage for two, the woman arrived not only not wearing a mask, but encouraging us to take off ours so that we could breathe.  After asking her to wear one, she refused and started referring to propaganda videos downplaying COVID.  We were charged full price as a cancellation fee.  If this is something that matters to you, I recommend avoiding at all costs.  Can not comment on the quality of the massage as we didn't receive them."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"So i had the best time lol.... Danial did my Shellac which is a beautiful pink was done really fast, and he also did an amazing job on my eyebrows(he brought them back to life) they were pain free i may go back for a brazilian wax by him.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Love coming here to see Tianna for my face wax. She is always so nice and energetic! Because I am always on the run, I really like how quick yet detail oriented she is and we always make sure we get me ready in no time. I have a full face package but I never know exactly what I want to get done before the day of my appointment so it's pretty awesome that I can decide when I get there without rescheduling or calling ahead."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I really enjoyed my trip to Savvy Nails. I was actually recommended by a friend, so I made an appointment before my vacation. I got a gel pedicure and a dip French manicure. Both are still looking beautiful after 2 weeks, will definitely go back! My friend had a beautiful design which is what attracted me to the nail salon. They had tons of colors and the staff was kind and listened to my wants. I paid cash and received 5% off! Will go back soon!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been in Tucson for about three years now and it took me forever to find a great nail shop but as soon as I got the chance at Classy's I've never went anywhere else.

I also love how Lee always has the newest stuff as far as powders, polishes & etc. im always getting something new, my favorite is the glow in the dark."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Make an appointment! Highly recommended to avoid waiting. Belle is the owner and she's so sweet, knowledgeable and just awesome! She's pierced my Tragus and helped me select and change out my nose rings. The shop is in the famous Ybor district of Tampa. It's clean inside and nicely decorated. I had a small tattoo done there by Kyle. He was quick and has nice line work! A man of few words but he got the job done. I'll definitely be back to see my Belle!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I had my daughters nose pierced by Corina here recently. She was given specific instructions to not touch the piercing. The ball on the piercing fell off 4 days later. Corina was then on vacation and told to come us to come back in 2 weeks she'd pierce it again. So we did were told she no longer works there and they won't give me my money back. Waste of time and $$. Wasted 75 including tip.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I first started going to Rittenhouse Dentists a year ago when I moved into center city and have nothing but good things to say about my experiences. My hygienist Susan was gentle and detailed with explanations af areas to focus on at home.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Worst mani/pedi ever.  I asked for the design and they did not do it.  I got a gel manicure and a regular pedi.  The mani was subpar and he did not take his time.  I will not be going back.I've been coming here for about a year now and I can honestly say I never have a bad experience. I've had a couple of different

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I was here visiting my daughter and I for a pedicure. The pedicure was great. The polish job was great, but the manicure was not so great. The massage was not good.

Love love love Rejuvepod!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Big fan! This is where I go for sugaring and if this is your kind of thing I highly recommend Leslie. She makes you feel super comfortable and there are no awkward moments which for those of us having hair removed just about anywhere from someone you barely know it can be pretty important. She's super pleasant and if you have time to book a massage after she's great at that too. I've also had a facial by Katarzyna and I was quite pleased with the treatment.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This was my first time here and I had the best experience.. I booked an appointment for a hair cut, layers to be precise... I showed Sarah a picture and answered a couple of questions regarding what I wanted.. She nailed it and I never got this result from so many other reputed salons in Philadelphia... The ambiance is clean and friendly... I enjoyed the music... And the cherry on the cake was the price.. At $45 ( excluding gratuity) I left with a fabulous hair cut!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,These guys are a cut above the rest. They take their time to get your cut right. They are a friendly staff with great attitude. Music and conversations are always positive. The crew is always timely with appointments. The shop is always clean. They do a great job with kids too. I've never been disappointed by my hair or beard cut. Most other barbers don't take as much time getting it right and I'm forced to fix their mistakes at home. The Bombshop is an A+ organization.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I was initially a bit skeptical about getting a haircut here, considering everyone is Asian and my hair can be wavy and different from what they may be used to. I decided to take a chance anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The guy who cut my hair didnt understand English too well but the owner, Kevin, translated what I wanted done. I'm pretty happy with the result and at $25 for women's cut and being so close to where I live, I wouldn't get a better deal!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Worst customer service ever. Bought a Groupon for keratin and cut. When I got to the salon, the guy( who didn't seem happy to be there in the first place) said he would charge me another 25$ per ounce of keratin used in my hair since it thicker. If that was disclosed on the groupon I would have had no problem. Instead of trying to work with me he just put his hands up and said ""I'm not the messenger"" I left. And will never go back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I had the pleasure of having my hair done by Ansen. The stylists at this establishment are nice and give off friendly vibes. The hair washing process was thorough and relaxing. Ansen really listened to me and cut my hair as I requested. He took his time and did an amazing job. He then blow dried it to perfection. Not once did he tug on my hair or rush. Probably one of my best hair experiences. Will be going back and recommending this place to my friends!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I am one who is very aware of true customer service & value. Maria's deserves the 5 stars she has a quality service, quality products for a fair price in a beautiful salon environment they do not rush you. They keep their appointments and if there was any issue with color they addressed it ,even ordered colors for me. My daughter was treating me for my birthday and we stumbled upon Maria's it's the best by far in our area. No riff raff either just relaxation :)"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"As long as I live in the Philadelphia, I will always go here. It's $25 for a gel manicure and they do a great job. You also get a full blown back massage AND hand massage. Sometimes they dip your hands in warm wax and wrap them up. Your hands feel so soft afterwards. It's great. They also have so many colors to choose from as far as polishes go and the salon is extremely clean! I would recommend this nail salon in center city to anyone!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Great massage. I had the male masseuse and he was very professional. He did a great job. I will be back!I am a very loyal customer of this place. I go to Lea and her husband.

They have a very comfortable waiting area and a nice selection
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"After reading the great reviews here, I thought I'd give it a shot. I was not disappointed. I am a former nail technician myself and have had a lot of bad experiences.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,Lotus Nails is located in a shopping center with lots of parking.  There is a large collection of colors and services available.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"As a male, age 65, male, male, female. I saw a male stylist and he was a very nice guy. I liked his work but the hair cut was a little too rough. It was still not a good haircut, it was uneven. I don't know how this place gets a 2.5 star rating because I'm pretty sure the stylist was just as great. I just went with the first stylist"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I really loved the massage. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a new massage. 

I'd also like to mention that the place is pretty nice. They had a great selection of colors, they had some really cool polishes.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Made an appointment two weeks in advance and they were able to squeeze me in for a massage the day before.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"At age 52 went for my first Brazilian was.  Brittany was very sweet, put me at ease, gave me some essential oil and deep breathing techniques to use during the wax.  Some of it really hurt but some of it didn't, and she was super fast!  I absolutely love the results and would highly recommend.  Will definitely be returning!!  Oh and I needed an appointment sooner than Brittany had availability.  She squeezed me in to meet my schedule which I REALLY appreciated."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"After 22 years of salon hopping, I have found a stylist who knows how to do my hair perfectly :D. Su Shan is sweet, smart, and totally ace at cutting and coloring.  I came in asking for cherry coke-red color and she nailed it; When walking back to my car after my appointment, I was stopped by three different women asking who did my color... Yes, really, Su Shan is that good! A month later, my color is still fade-free and the hair compliments keep rolling in."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Don't be fooled by the location. My mother treated my 8 bridesmaids, two of my aunts, and myself (the bride), to mani/pedis. They offered less than half of us a pedicure menu and beverage menu, myself being the less than. I also had multiple burn marks on my fingers from the electric file and acrylics that were both applied and shaped crooked. They were extremely careless and we all left the exact opposite of relaxed. My mother still tipped more than 20% but you absolutely lost good business."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"If you have thin and brittle nails like me, I highly recommend using dip powder for your manicures. I've been using it for the past few months at the suggestion of the manicurists at Polished and have seen such a difference in my nails. After years of using acrylic nails, switching to dip powder gave my nails the break they needed. Thanh did an incredible job making the job look so natural and I love the color! Thanks again, Polished! You guys are the best in the city!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Place was very clean, staff was extremely friendly and they make you feel comfortable being in the shop. They have a lot of cool stuff to look at while you are waiting. My artist was Aldo, he was amazing! Super friendly and attentive to make sure i was doing good throughout the entire process. We talked about getting together and discussing future tattoo ideas for a full sleeve. I will definitely be back to this shop and will most certainly see Aldo again! I highly recommend this shop!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I haven't had my hair cut since before March, and was looking to get a textured blunt long bob at a cute place that was taking the pandemic seriously. If you're looking for something similar, I've found it!! This is your place. 

They took every safety measure possible, and gave me such a confidence-boosting cute cut. Everyone was super kind, too. Even though my hair is thick, my style only took 30 minutes without a blowout. I can't wait to go back for more services in the future."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon with no appointment for gel polish and toe polish. The place was packed . Right away a sweet girl asked me what I wAnted done and she did my toes and put rhinestones. Very pleasant and perfectly done. Then I was told by a different girl ti sit down at her table. She filed my nails, gel polish and put rhinestones on. Perfection. Wait then you get a neck massage and a free paraffin wax!! Very reasonable prices too and very welcoming."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Got a shave here the other day after being apathetic for too long and realizing i had a beard.  The shave was good (7 hot towels...wow!) but the place was rather high and mighty, and the shave was kind of expensive ($40 without tip).  Not sure if I will go back or try montelone or whitney - the old school places are always better conversationalists.

I've never had such a close shave in my life, and that was cool.  I really forgot what i looked like..."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love this place. Get the 30min stress release massage, because it's just the perfect time and is such a wonderful little mood booster. 

Everything is warm and softly lit and calming. You sit and wait with a little hot cider or cranberry juice and then you get whisked away to serenity. 

They treat you well and the entire experience is everything a spa should be. I've overpaid at the Four Seasons spa and even at an Irish castle once, but this place is by far my favorite."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,What a fantastic experience!  My daughter and I were looking for massages sort of last minute. I called for 2 massage appointments with less than 24 hours notice. Ollie was super accommodating and was able to secure spots for us both. The spa is so warm and inviting. Smells amazing. Calming atmosphere. Super clean. Dominic was incredible. He has an uncanny sense of just what your body is calling out for. Melissa worked on my 16 year old daughter and she was amazing as well.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I never make an appointment but they always have women that accommodate me. Anna has taken care of me each time I've been in. And today I went in for an eyebrow and lip wax. Emmy took care of my waxing and was very quick and sweet. This salon is big and has a lot of room for groups. Very clean as well. 
I live in St.Pete and make the trip to carrollwood when I need a mani or pedi. This group of nail techs are worth it!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I visited this salon to get my nails done for a wedding I was in town for. The salon is beautiful, clean, and well kept. I got a gel manicure with nail design. The nail technician did a great job on my gel manicure and she helped me bring my nail design vision to life. The only negative feedback I have is the woman at the front desk isn't very friendly. I would frequent this salon again because the ambience is good and so are the nail techs."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,The worst service that I've ever had. I went in to get my nails done and the girl who did them had a bad attitude. I asked her if she could take me and she said yes. I waited in the pedicure chair for about 20 minutes while the girl who did my nails put the nail polish on and started putting the polish on. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she said it was my nails.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"So glad i found this place. The owner, Nancy, is very kind and makes sure you are comfortable. She is a true professional.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Referred by a friend to go to the salon and decided to try it out. I was not disappointed. I am a former salon manager, and have had great experiences with many of the stylists.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Unbelievably bad customer service! I asked for the design on my toes and they didn't even get the design on my nails. The nails look terrible and the paint job was terrible.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I have been going to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk.  The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly.  

The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I am re-writing this review because I realized my review was deleted. Anyways, I had such a bad experience here with the lack of focus from a barber that my entire head needed to be buzzed. The barber decided to part my hair on the top part of my head. I recognize it was just one barber who did this and not the whole shop, just be extremely cautious and tell them exactly what you want... I even showed the barber a photo and it still was messed up..."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place is truly amazing! The owner is so sweet! Just had a long day at work and didn't make a reservation. Lucky me, was able to walk-in and get a hour foot reflexology, feeling like a brand new person! My favorite part is the last 5 mins of the shoulder massage. It is the best part!!! Different from some of the horrible reviews... I have been coming here for 5 years now and they never let me down once! The owner and staff are always professional and welcoming."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"was told there would​ be an hour and a half delay before​ she could take me! There were 2 customers before me. She said she was the only one working that day. She was​ very rude & did not seem to care if I waited or stayed.  As a manager, she should have offered me a coupon for my inconvenience​ and she should have called in another person to help out. She seemed TOTALLY INDIFFERENT.  There are MANY other places to get a haircut in this area."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Even with all of the construction mess downtown right now I wouldn't recommend any other shop. I've gotten work done here for years and it just gets better. Kristin did an amazing cover up for me that is allowing me to continue down my arm with a beautiful design I couldn't have done otherwise. All of the work I have seen come out of Black Rose has been top-notch. The extra attention to cleanliness and safety is a major plus too. I've already recommended Kristin to several friends.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I have had several piercings and a tattoo from here. The piercers are amazing and put me completely at ease whenever I get them! My tattoo was about twice as much as it would have been at any other place but it was well worth it. I opted to get a tattoo at another shop to save money. I do like my other tattoos but not even being 5 months they need to be touched up. I will for sure go to metamorphosis for the rest of my tattoos!!!
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Ok i had a huge problem inside the Country side mall location. I went in to buy an Obagi product. Close to $100 dollars. I asked when the expiration  date was and she said june. that means my product would have went bad. It is actually the second time i found a product ready to expire. I asked for the manager who was beyond rude and unprofessional. She told me I did not have to buy it. She did not  see anything wrong with selling expired products!
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I love this dermatologist office! The staff is sweet and I've always been seen promptly. I also think Dr Sarah Jackson is wonderful, just by talking with her you can tell she's very smart, extremely competent, and a great sense of humor. Not to mention she can diagnose your condition nearly at the speed of light AND accurately. I received my treatment right there on the spot without having to make another appointment. Quick, reliable, and to the point without cutting corners is always a plus in my book."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I used to go to a barber and although barbers can be great with clippers, they aren't as knowledgeable about how to use scissors, and in particular a how to do a gentleman's style haircut. If your a guy and want your hair to part a certain way, you have to get your hair cut at a certain angle, etc. Desiree is excellent. It's no wonder why she's 1 week out on appointments. She is very knowledgeable, and I've never had someone that is so thorough. I highly recommend."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I had my first visit today at Colleen Elizabeth for a Brazilian with Lauren. I must say she knows what she's doing and is very good at it. She did an amazing job!  I have been to a few places to get waxed, but I must say this place is the best! There was no feeling awkwardness. She actually has a conversation with you which eases the awkwardness and it was pretty quick. I will definitely be back. I have already scheduled my next appointment."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I strongly stand by the Aveda brand. I've had extremely positive experiences at all of their salons and spas (not only in St. Louis but also in New York and DC) and Philip Johnson is no different. I've had a few of the stylists cut my hair and they were all awesome. My favorite part of the experience is after they shampoo your hair, they put peppermint oil in your hair and scalp and give you a head massage. It's extremely relaxing and is a nice little added touch."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,5 star rating from someone else. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the massage was a little too painful. I am not sure if the masseuse was a little rough but it was okay. It was a little painful but it was ok. I would recommend this place to anyone. I love this place! I've been getting my nails done by Anna for over 10 years and she always does a great job.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Nick is my favorite stylist!  She is an expert in color and cut, and I have never been disappointed.  

She is also very knowledgeable and friendly.  She is also very knowledgeable and personable.  I am always pleased with my haircut and color.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"We used to go here regularly. The last time I went, I had a guy do my nails. He was very rough. The woman that did my nails was so rough and rough that it hurt. It was painful.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Went in for the first time last week with my sister for a pedicure. We were seated immediately and we had a nice time. The pedicure was nice, but it was not worth the price. The paint job was sloppy and uneven. I had to ask her to file and buff my nails with a file and she did not. My sister also received a gel manicure and was charged $55. She was happy with the"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This place is fabulous. I go to the same girl every two weeks and she always does a great job. If you want a great, relaxed and rejuvenating experience, this is the place to go. I have been to many places in the area and this one is by far the best. Highly recommend. I have been going to this place for over 3 years. I've had great haircuts here and have never had a bad cut."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I have gone to Elite Nails and Spa several times for a gel manicure and pedicure.  The first time I went, they did a good job on my nails and were very friendly.  The second time I went, I had a man who was very rough.  He was rough and rough.  I also got a pedicure with a basic manicure.  My nails look terrible and I can't even get my"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Bikini wax- Fine. Definitely took time to explain the process and what she was going to do. She was fast and precise. The results were both painless and painless. The result was great. I had no issues with the waxing as it was as I had hoped. The staff is always friendly. I have also had my brows waxed and they are both so quick and painless. I will definitely be going back!
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,If I could give no stars I would. I went in for a simple gel manicure and the woman doing it had a bad attitude. I asked her if she could take it off and she said yes. It was clear she was annoyed about it. I asked for a gel manicure and a gel pedicure and she just brushed it off and didn't even say anything. I didn't get a manicure or pedicure.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I've come back a few times and I've never had a bad experience. The salon is clean and the staff is very friendly. The prices are reasonable, and the massages are amazing. I highly recommend this salon.I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. I always get a great haircut at the same time.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I'm normally a big fan of a nail salon, but I will not be going back. I went in for a gel manicure and the manicurist was very rough with my cuticles and cuticles. I was extremely disappointed. My nails look like they had been painted by a 2 year old. I did not feel the attention to detail was received. I also felt like my nails were cut too short."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I see Katie at Salon Diversions. She is professional, friendly, and a joy to talk to. I had a fabulous cut and color by Katie and she did a fantastic job. She was extremely personable and listened to what I wanted. I was very happy with the results. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone. I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Excellent visit!  I had waited 4 months to return for an adjustment and my neck showed it.  I got a 30 minute massage from Lori - and she was strong and sensitive at the same time.  She really helped to get rid of the muscle knots in my neck and shoulders.  I was seen promptly by Dr. Kollias and received a successful realignment.  I have gone to many chiropractors over the years and Dr. K is my favorite, go-to doctor - that I highly recommend."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I'm so glad I hired Santa Barbara Hair and Makeup to help me get ready for my wedding. Emily did a fantastic job. She did everything how I wanted it, and was also willing to share her expertise when I asked for her input. It was a pleasure to work with her because she is very friendly and professional. Emily made the whole process of getting ready a great experience. I'd highly recommend her to any bride or anyone else who wants to look their best for a special occasion."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"We are relatively new to the area and my high school age daughter needed a trim. Salon D'va, located in a historic looking home, caught our eye. Liz Church was great! She talked over ideas with my daughter to make sure she met her expectations. She also did a great job waxing her eyebrows to correct  a mistake my daughter made at home. The trim and eyebrows were very flattering and my daughter was thrilled with the outcome. The price was very reasonable too. We will definitely be back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Super clean and sharp cuts.
I was here for a wedding. I am from Orlando, Fl. 
I was a walk in, they seem to prefer appointments because I had to wait for a few minutes (about 30 minutes).
Considering the fact that the barbers had some appointments at the time I came, they took care of me fairly quickly.
My barber was Ace; amazing individual and very polite, he listened to what I wanted and delivered exceptionally.
Bilingual btw, made me feel very comfortable.
I had a great time.
Highly recommended 
Thank You
God Bless You guys"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I went to Nate's for a standard cut on a weekday.  I was seated quickly and he shaped me up nicely, paying attention to detail. The price of the cut was more than affordable. Nate is super welcoming and will chat you up on a variety of topics that you're interested in. He's also actively involved in the community through various initiatives through his shop. 

Overall, I had an awesome experience. I've found my neighborhood barbershop and am actually really looking forward to getting my hair cut here again!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Great haircut (from previous experiences), but disrespectful of your time.  Appointment only system AND STILL 30 minutes late and told 10 more minutes before walking out today.  Barbers busy chatting, meanwhile 8 people come and go ahead of me before walking out.  Seems 8 people ahead are regulars, I certainly question whether their appt was ahead of mine.

Previously would go before appt system but gave up for silly wait times.  Once the appt system has come online decided to try again, I see nothing has changed."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I received a eye lash tint, brow tint, & brow wax. Brows are great! Lashes not so much.... not dark enough, didn't get the tint down to the base, and did not tint the lower lashes. Also, my lash lady did not wear gloves and we are in the middle of a pandemic. Gross on a normal day and I think it's against phase 1 protocol. I didn't realize it until she pulled the tint off my lashes and I opened my eyes. Also no private rooms. Won't be returning."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Ohhhh my goodness I'm from Tampa and literally they do better that high end places in Tampa. And seriously super nice. I got my nails done by a fucking amateur and they took them off for free then gave me an amazing price for the mood gel stuff. And seriously put up with my busy body one year old. Seriously I am not sure why dude had to slay my nails so amazingly but HE DID THAT! And for the next 6 months they will have a very consistent customer.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Today was my first visit to Gravity in Ambler. It was wonderful. I was greeted warmly and directed to a waiting area. My new stylist Michelle introduced herself seconds later and discussed options for my hair style.
After a great wash I was seated for my cut. Michelle is adorable but more importantly she is an accomplished beautician. She achieved everything I requested. I will be returning in 6 weeks for color and cut. I am so happy to find a salon that is friendly, fun and professional.
V in Maple Glen."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Joined as a member recently and this place is really convienent with online bookings and being open late. All the massages I've had have been good to excellent. Kristen was the best if you are looking for some serious pressure. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and helpful. I would suggest with the flexibility they offer. Being a member is really easy too it's just paying for one massage a month and if you don't use you can roll over or give to someone else. They don't expire.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Came here twice in one week because it was so good. The staff is courteous and the place is very clean. I enjoyed a 30 min foot and 30 chair massage for only $50. I'm normally a 1hr Table massage kind of girl but it was the best foot massage I've ever had. They even soak your feet in hot water before which I thought was great. I was having a killer migraine and came here because I read massages help. I left feeling relaxed and headache free. Highly recommend.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Dr. Ilyas is the best dermatologist I have used. She is attentive and open with suggestions. Concerns for moles, discoloration, or bumps, etc. are discussed fully and seriously. Always professional in her dealings with concerns in ""private"" areas. Willing to treat (remove) conditions of skin that are disliked by me, but are unsure of their threat. Better safe than sorry is my view, and Dr Ilyus respects that approach. I recommend her and her office Montgomery Dermatology in King of Prussia."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"In my opinion threading has become an art form, which is a nice touch. She does a great job and I always feel like a million bucks when I leave. I always get compliments on my eyebrows. 

The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I'm always a bit upset with the service I get. 

I'd say if you're looking for a great eyebrow threading place, go to Aisha"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Walk-ins on Tuesdays have increased greatly. The quality of their pedicures is excellent. I have never had an issue with the technician, but they're the only ones in town I go to. They take their time and make sure you're happy. I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous because I had a lot of high expectations. I got a gel manicure and pedicure."

They offered me water, coffee, or wine."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Okay. so. I had been here a couple times and decided to try it for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I got right in. The shop is clean and very relaxing.

I've had 3 different barbers there and have had a great cut each time.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Just had my first appointment here. The woman who did my nails did a great job! She was very friendly and the place was clean. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality nail salon in the area. I will be back!I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I have been to a few different salons and this is the first one that I have been to that I have had a great experience.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  I have been to many salons and this one is by far the best.  I love my hair and I love the color and cut.  I highly recommend this salon!I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Can't praise the owner and Shaina enough!  I have highlights, low lights, cut & style done regularly with Shaina and we all know how long that takes when done all together... Needless to say Heather, the salon owner, always reaches out to me before my appointment to coordinate a manicure and/or pedicure during my hair appointment!... I live 30 minutes from the salon and they are always trying to accommodate me and make better use of my time!  Always friendly and put up with me working during my appointments!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I freaking love this place. Everyone I've seen has done spectacular work with my hair. I've learned so much about hair and how to treat it well. I always went to cheaper salons and then got into Aveda and I'm never going back. The experience is so amazing and my hair is sooo healthy after coming here for 2 years now. I started with Mina, went to Laney for awhile and now I see Alyssa (my queen). They all are amazing and do such great work. So thankful for this salon!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Horrible customer service! Avoid! I had made an appointment for a haircut & brow wax. When I show up for my appointment they said they didn't have any wax, as if not being prepared isn't bad enough, you couldn't notify me in advance? I then proceeded to wait for 35 minutes! After checking in with the front desk numerous times about the wait the receptionist was totally heinous. They obviously don't care about their clients whatsoever. I eventually had to just walk out since they were not going to help me."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I came to this salon yesterday after being screwed over by the nail salon (Nail Bar Phila) I have been loyal to for three years.

The Nail Spa bar indeed took care of me - they calmed my nerves with two glasses of wine, a discount off of my nails since it was for my birthday, and they even gave a complimentary gift! My nails look GORGEOUS, and I am ready to look and feel fabulous for my birthday weekend celebration!

I highly recommend it! I will be coming here for now on!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,This place is meh. The first sign should of been the lack of customers and the amount of availability. There are better places around but I was short on time. Don't be like me do your research. Got a mani pedi and leg wax. She was rough with the e-file. My nail would get hot under the file and she hit my finger a couple times rushing to get done. Their waxing techniques are very old school so it actually hurt a little. Better to spend your time and money elsewhere.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Dr. Brian Buinewicz is the best plastic surgeon and cosmetic doctor.  He truly cares about his patients and goes above and beyond every single time.  I've known him for years, had two surgeries with him and couldn't be happier.  I trust him with anything I need or want cosmetically, I know I will always get an honest opinion from him for any procedure I may want to have and if it will work for me.

It doesn't get any better than this practice...,gorgeous office and wonderful top notch staff."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Danny is extremely rude and does not do perfect gel nails (as he muttered over and over). After a horrible experience with him which the manager knew about, I was still charged $30 for the service. This place used to be my go to as all of the other manicurists I have had at the salon are friendly and do a great job. After the way management handled the situation, as well as Danny's unprofessional behavior, I will not be returning. Such a terrible experience and a total waste of money."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"The first time I came here, I needed a fill. Previous places I had been were less satisfactory, but this place had good reviews. It was phenomenal! However, I recently went for a full set and found it somewhat unsatisfactory. Someone different from before did my nails, although the color is what I wanted, the nails look to thick and barely even close to the end of my nail, making them look too obviously fake and like they've already grown out a week. I'm rather disappointed as it cost almost $50."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Cute little nail salon that is literally 2 minutes from my house. They just opened and already have such a long wait- in a good way! I came in as a walk-in on a Saturday right before Mother's Day for a pedicure and had to schedule a service for 3pm the same day. I'm glad I did because I loved the service, hospitality, and options available. Everyone was super nice. I'll probably go back again after a month or so to check out how it is after it gets more steady."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This is my first review on Yelp. I've been wanting to get into the habit of writing reviews, especially when GREAT service is provided. 
  We all pleasure here and there in this life . Mine happens to be monthly Pedi|Mani. 
Wixen Nails is brand new in the area, the salon is very well decorated and all their staff are very incentive to details . 
 And last but not least , they are very friendly and make sure to put a big smile on my face when I left."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I was at the resteraunt location and the woman who did my pedicure did a great job. I had a very nice experience, but the pedicure was not great.

They make you feel very welcome and comfortable."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I was in town visiting and needed a pedicure.  I was able to get in and get an appointment the same day.  The place is very clean and the staff was very friendly.

The owner, however, is the most unprofessional and unprofessional person I have ever met.  She said she was sorry for the service and that she would give me a refund.  I was the only one in the salon and didn't even want to give her a refund.  She tried to charge me for the service"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I've been going here for years. The only reason I've gone back is because I don't like the way they do nails. The girl that does my nails does a great job and does a good job.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,my daughter just came home crying and upset. Her nails look terrible! She went in with a design she asked for and showed it to them but that is not what they gave her. She ended up asking them just to paint them plain and they charged her for the extra time to paint them plain even though they are the ones they couldn't do the design correctly. When my daughter said she wanted them just done plain instead the girl got snotty and just painted them very poorly. Never going back.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Great boutique studio/gym. The place is very clean and the barre studio is one of the best in the area. The place runs specials a lot so you can always find a good deal on classes. I've taken many classes there with many different instructors, most of which are amazing. My only ""con"" comment is I wish they had better spin instructors. There are few that are not very challenging (caters to the beginner) and one that is not very nice.  Overall though, this place is a good spot to try."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Dr. Case and his staff are incredibly friendly, supportive, and knowledgeable. I had a breast augmentation 3 years ago from doctor case and my results are incredible. People always ask me if they are real as he did such a phenomenal job give me natural look and feel I wanted. I have sent several friends to him for similar procedures and they too are thrilled with their results. After hearing stories from friends who went to other surgeons and their dissatisfaction with their results, I strongly recommend  Dr."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My girlfriends and i got together for a relaxed pampered afternoon at Mi Cumbia. What an amazing experience! As soon as we walked in, the smells (coconut, mango, lemongrass) were entoxicating. The service was amazing, and we left, not only beautified, but relaxed and rejuvinated. Everyone was so friendly and professional. The atmosphere was tranquil and relaxing, and the services they provide were amazing. I highly recommend the mimos pedi with mango massage & the manicure. I wish i lived in Philly- i would be there all the time."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"After much consideration, I called the salon back and informed them of what had happened. The receptionist was extremely accommodating as well as the manager, Mary.  I was told to come back later  that day to fix my hair.  Mary was excellent and apologetic about the whole situation. She re-cut my hair and it looks stunning. She also blew my hair dry and informed me that you do not have to call to specify that you want that service.  Thanks for a great experience the second time around."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Lynn Nails is definitely the spot for an amazing pedicure. My boyfriend and I decided to get a deluxe spa pedicure before leaving for vacation. I must say this was by far the best pedicure ever!! It was so good and comforting. My boyfriend was so relaxed he couldn't even get up. 
The technicians were so kind and the thing I appreciated the most was they took their time, from massaging to polishing, the job was phenomenal! Plus, it was actually my first time getting the paraffin wax and it felt incredible!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I go to this hair cuttery all the time, and have been coming here since I was a kid. I recently had a relaxer treatment on my hair and an iron set to straighten it. came out amazing! my daughter, who has Shirley temple curly hair, got straight across bangs and they did an amazing job! I've never had a bad experience here. the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I have very long hair and it costs extra to have it dried and straightened after getting a cut."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My first time at Xcape and I loved it! I went in this past Friday after reading about the nail bar on yelp but they were booked, they were very welcoming and assisted me right away so I made an appointment for today. Everyone is friendly, the music playlist was the best and it was overall relaxing. I love the way my eyebrows came out I rarely go to places and my eyebrows are done correctly because they are extremely thick but Ms. Liz nailed it thanks! I'll definitely be back soon!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Planet fitness gets four stars just because it is open 24 hours. If you are looking at cheapest it's cheapest best bang for your buck . Not much motivation since bodybuilders don't go there much mostly big women . No pun intended . No discrimination I myself used to be big, although I changed that . 
Tanning bed and massage chairs and a sculpt machine and everything. Else for 20.00 a month . 9.99 - the massage and stuff and can't bring friends . All the employees are polite and helpful ."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,So obsessed with the results. She is an artist and I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same place for over a year now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and they always look so great. They offer a great deal of specials and I've never had to wait long at
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Not sanitary AT ALL! I asked for the same nail design I got from my previous salon and the girl did not have the nail design I asked for and the nail tech did not say anything to me. I told her I wanted a white on my nails and she did not understand me. I had a gel manicure done and it started chipping within 3 days. I will never go here again.This place is awesome!  I went in for a
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,They did not do a good job at all.  I will not be going back.  The owner is not very friendly.  There are some things you can't take care of that you don't want to be unhappy with.I've been going to see Kim for almost 3 years now. She is very friendly and professional. I can't wait to see her again!I've been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"They're alright. I feel that some of the guys here are good at cutting hair, but I'm not a fan of the way they cut my hair. The first time I went, it was just a little more expensive than the first time, but I thought it was worth it. The first time I went, I was going to get a haircut with the straightener (which I didn't want), but I wanted to try a new place."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,One of the best massage therapists I have ever had. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same stylist for many years now and have never had a bad cut or color.  It's a very cool experience.  My stylist is Kim and she is always a pleasure to talk to.  I have had many different stylists and they all do a great job.  I have had a few different stylists over the years
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Just went to Harmony for the first time today and I was very pleased! The salon was clean and the staff was very friendly. The salon is very modern and clean. The owner was very helpful and made sure I was comfortable during my visit. I will be back!The staff was very friendly and professional. I was greeted immediately and offered a drink and a mimosa. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The gentleman who did my nails was
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"LOVED it!!!

I got an 80 minute deep tissue massage and it was amazing. The massage was very relaxing and felt very good. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality deep tissue massage. I will be back!I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from this salon. I got a gel manicure and pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I was down in the area and I thought I would try it. I called the salon and asked if they had any openings. The woman that answered the phone was so rude and made me feel uncomfortable. I told her I wanted a manicure and she said ""yes"" and walked away. I said ""yes"" and she proceeded to tell me that it would be $20 more. I was shocked. I tried to explain it to her but she didn't"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I LOVE this place. The owner is so sweet and makes you feel so welcome. She does the best job on nails. The place is clean and the staff is always so nice. I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and always get a great experience.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I have come here off and on for years and have had varying results (especially with color) but during my pregnancy I came here exclusively bc they have the safest options for color. Saw a few different girls who were all fine but recently saw Colleen and absolutely loved her. She took a lot of time to understand what I wanted and I am so happy with the end result. The assistant Sophia was also super sweet and got me water about 5x. I will be back to see Colleen in the future!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"So I went here a few years ago and they didn't do well.. They refused to do
A gel pedicure..and they didn't take off the tack on my gel..so it stayed wet for an hour..

Then the other day I went. It took them 3 hours from my friends simple, red mani/pedi.. My mani/pedi don't match.. Took her four times painting my nails and taking it off and re-painting. They couldn't do any gem designs and two days later my nails broke. Let me add my pinkie nails are over dramatically shorter than the rest."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I am very impressed with the service received at this business. After my very first waxing EVER, I had some concerns and was able to text the owner directly, with her replying immediately! She then refunded my entire visit because she knew I was not 100% happy with my results . She was more than willing to fix the problem, but I wasn't able to make it in, so she refunded everything!! This is HUGE as a business owner ..and makes me trust her business completely!
She handled this problem with class and professionalism."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I really enjoyed my haircut here recently.  The staff was very friendly.  I planned to have a service, but they consulted with me and told me I did not have to get the botanical because my hair is pretty healthy.  I am happy they were honest with me so I didn't have to spend the extra money.  My haircut was done by Lauren.  She took her time and gave me exactly what I wanted.  Just remember they only accept cash tips and there is no ATM machine!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've gone here since the womb....literally! My grandma gets her hair done here, my mom gets her hair done here, and so do I. Cathy and her team treats their clients like family as soon as they walk in. No, you don't come here if you're looking for a ""cheap"" haircut, but you most definitely get your money's worth. I am now a Lafayette local and still drive the hour down to get my hair done here. Maybe I'm biased, but this is a high quality salon that you won't be disappointed in."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I had extra time before work and decided to stop by first thing in the morning. The receptionist was terrible at greeting and wasn't friendly at all. I felt like I wasn't welcomed at all. I decided to proceed with the service and get my eyebrows waxed. Terrible job! I had to pluck my own hairs after the waxing because she couldn't see the hairs she missed. She kept rudely sighing throughout the waxing and even asked if I had cash. It really seemed like she got mad when I said I didn't.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I asked for a tattoo in a more realistic style than American traditional, which was all that was displayed in the flash that literally covers all the walls.  I'm already heavily tattooed, and nothing on my body is American traditional.  What did I get?  American traditional.  Artist was nice enough and took me right away as a walk-in, which was stupid on my part, I've always researched my artist.  The tattoo is fairly well done, but not what I wanted.  I'll be removing it after it heals."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"You guys this is my nail salon no matter what other salons i always end up back with them. I like to feel at home when i come here they greet me by name. I have brought my friends and family here. I am
Recommending you guys try them too. They are pretty up to date on all the new new things we like for our nails. Their prices are also very reasonable. sometimes they are booked up so call ahead if you have somewhere to go. They also have wine and coffee complimentary"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"WOULD NOT BE COMING HERE AGAIN

My first time here and customer service was bad. Appointment was at 1:30, got there at 1:15. Did not get seated until 2 pm. After that just the service felt rushed and she did not do a great job. Wanted a deep conditioning treatment she barely applied any onto my hair. No apologies regarding the wait when I had an appointment Haircut i got is not exactly what I wanted. I said layers and she just trimmed them. I waited longer than my actual time on the chair."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I love my experience EVERY time I go. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I go every 2 weeks and have had a lot of compliments. The salon is clean and the staff is so friendly. I highly recommend this salon. I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was a walk-in, but I was not greeted at all. They told me to come back later in the day if I wanted to wait."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I loved Jenny, she made me feel comfortable and at ease. My first time going to her, I wasn't sure what to expect, but she made sure I was comfortable and I left feeling so much better. I will be going back for sure. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"**Reviewing only EYEBROW THREADING**
Service - Staff - The owner/manager -

I have been to the front desk and have had a great experience.  The front desk staff are always very friendly and helpful.  

The waxing was quick and painless.  

They offer a loyalty card with your service and will tell you to tip on your first visit. 

I went on a Thursday"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I downloaded the app and asked for the appointment and they said they couldn't give me the full time appointment. I had to get a call to get the appointment, so I called again to ask if I could get in the next day. I told them I had to reschedule with someone else. They said I would have to reschedule the appointment with a different stylist. I was charged $150 for a mistake and an additional $200 for a mistake"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I started going to Naomi last year and she is amazing! She takes her time and does a great job. I had a bad experience at another salon, and she fixed it. I have been going to her for over a year now and can't imagine going anywhere else. She does a great job with color and cut and it always looks great! I highly recommend her!I love this place. It's very clean and the staff is very nice."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,This was easily the worst experience I have ever had. I will never go back. I will never go back. I went to get a gel manicure and it was $35. 00. It was $25. 00. I thought I was going to get the same thing. The woman was very rude and I felt uncomfortable. I didn't think she was going to make my nails look good. She kept pushing me to get gel polish.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This salon is a great find. The owner, Nancy, is very kind and the salon is very clean. I had a fabulous experience. The staff was very nice and professional. The pedicure was excellent. I will be back. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from this salon. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The tech did a great job."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Just found this spot. They have the best massage chairs I've ever seen. I just got a massage and the best I've had. The atmosphere is so relaxed and relaxing. They offer water, tea, wine, coffee, wine, and water. The staff is always friendly. They also do facials. I've had several massages and all have been very professional. I highly recommend this place."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Horrible! I went here because it was the only nail salon I will go to for a pedicure. The salon is cute but the girl that did my pedicure was very rough. She was rough and rushed. She rushed through the whole thing. I will not be coming back. I was looking for a place to get my nails done. I came here for the first time. I was very disappointed with the service I received.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Fantastic pedicure treatment for an amazing price! 

I will definitely be back!Very rude. I had an appointment and I waited 15 min before the man who did my nails was even taking off my acrylics. I'm not from the area but I will be back.I have been a client at this nail salon for over a year. I have never had a bad experience. Today was my first time getting dip powder and the experience was"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I had a very nice time here and the staff is very friendly. My pedicure was done very well. The place is clean and the staff was very nice. The massage chairs are great and the massage chairs are great. I would definitely come back. Great salon with great service. I have been going to them for years. I have never had a bad experience. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating. I am extremely happy with the results.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,This place sucks and this is the worst. I went in for a simple gel manicure and the woman doing it had no idea what she was doing. I showed her a picture and she said it was her first day at work. I had to explain what I wanted and she was going to charge me $10 more to fix it. I told her it was a basic manicure and she just went ahead and tried to charge me $10 more.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I haven't been to the salon in over a year. I saw a lot of people go there. I had an appointment and I got a mani/pedi. The woman doing my pedicure was very rough. I was extremely disappointed. My nails look like they had been painted by a 2 year old. I did not feel the attention to detail I received was enough. I did not get a manicure or pedicure.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"If you you respect women, do not go here. I saw a male tech who was rude and did not speak very good English, but he said he was the owner of the store. I was told to pick out a color, and it was not what I wanted. The tech also had a woman working with him and did not speak very good English. I was so uncomfortable. I will never go back to this nail salon. Great experience."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"It was my first visit to Tina's today and I will definitely be back!  I had a mani/pedi and everything was done right!  The salon is very clean, everyone was nice and my service was perfect.  My technician took care to ensure that my nails had the right shape and she was meticulous with her painting, and gave a wonderful massage.  I have been searching for a really good nail place in the Spring Garden area for 3 years and I have finally found it!  I highly recommend Tina's!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The Refuge Spa is absolutely stunning! I felt relaxed from the moment I walked through the door! I received the Head to Toe package and oh my gosh, every kink and sore I had from head to toe melted away! After my massage, I got a delicious cocktail from the spa bar and relaxed in a very cozy lounge! All the staff members are very friendly w/ a smile on their face and you can see they genuinely care about their customers! I cannot wait for my next spa day at The Refuge Spa!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I've been a regular at my chiropractors office for over a year, but realized I was getting the most benefit from massage therapy. I was searching for a new place and found Indy Massage Company through Yelp. My first massage with April was amazing and I left my appointment feeling so relaxed. I have another appointment tomorrow and am looking forward to becoming a regular client. 

If you're considering Indy Massage Company, just make an appointment...you won't be disappointed! It's a relaxing atmosphere with skilled therapists and they offer great perks for returning customers."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I went here for the first time today in hopes to find a new nail salon and I have found it! The two people that work in there were so nice and welcoming! It was my first time and I did have an appointment so it was a breeze. They do seem to be busy so I would recommend an appointment. The nice man that did my pedicure and manicure worked diligently to make sure my nails looked perfect! I am so pleased and so happy I took a chance here!! Will be returning!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"First time at this location.  The pedicure wasn't as thorough as what I'm used to. ...The gel manicure looked very nice but started to chip already after 3 days. The guy doing my nails was almost on auto pilot... completely disconnected. The lady that did my eyebrows was very friendly,  but she didn't clean my penciled in brows before starting, to get a clear view.  She didn't tweeze either.  I might go there again if I'm in the area,  but might have to provide more direction than I'd like."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Jen is the absolute best hair stylist! I have been going to her for 15+ years. She always make my hair dreams come true. She has taken me from blonde, brown, red, black and back again. I don't trust anyone else with my hair color and will probably have to travel from CA to Nashville now just for my hair! She is extremely talented at balayage and hair painting. Plus her easy going attitude and sense of humor always made the appointment that much more enjoyable. Book her and you will not be disappointed!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"everything but the service was great. i personally felt that the aestetician was not warm and i did not feel comfortable having her shave my upper lip for laser hair removal. the atmosphere, the service listed are great, but this one specific lady I had made me feel rather uncomfortable. imo, she was not the meticulous type and looked rather clumsy and tended to 'skim' ... as in she could have been more detailed, could have been more informative, could have been other things. i wish the ladies at the front were the aestheticians."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Not a soul in here on Mother's Day.  $17 bucks for a less than a 10-minute haircut.  Didn't cut it very even across the front and used the clippers too closely on the back.  

I guess it is nice that they give you a free 30-day guarantee to touch up the sides/back but I would rather just have a quality haircut instead.

Guess if you don't have an appointment and need a place upon on Sundays this fits the bill.    Quest for a quality barber in St. Louis continues."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Absolute racket of a place.

Terrible manicure - polish was on the cuticles, on my skin. I had to ask her to go and clean up my nails with nail polish remover. 

$25 credit card minimum which is absurd considering a manicure is $20. 

I made an appointment for 3pm and no one saw me till 3:30

Wouldn't let me tip in Venmo because they saw I had cash in my hand (since I was forced to go the ATM) even though they had let people right before me tip in Venmo. 

An incredibly frustrating experience."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"For Friday the 13th my sister in law, niece & I went to get 2 piercings each. Of course it was slightly busy because of the special going on but our piercer Carrie did an outstanding job. I got the tragus & daith piercings. As much time as I had I kept looking it up and scaring myself about how much it hurt when I finally got on the chair I barely felt both piercings!! Carrie has a very smooth touch & I'll definitely go back again from here on out to this shop!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was on vacation and just wanted my dip taken off and a regular manicure. This was during COVID-19 and the one person in the shop had a mask and there was a plexiglass separation between us. It was not clear the utensils had been sanitized. She just took them out of a box on her table and used a nail file from a jar. The manicure was sub par. She didn't ask me what shape just filed and then the polish was just dabbed on, not to the cuticles. I would not recommend."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"TWO of my fingers got cut and bled in the process!!! Wtf? I should've known when I walked in and the poor betta fish is swimming in cloudy, unfiltered water and there were no other customers... My gut told me to leave but I was trying to find something to do to kill an hour so I took the chance and regret it. Lady was nice enough but the place was kind of messy, food wrappers behind the counter, dusty trays, and no music, so it was kind of awkward too. Will not return."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Been going to Lisa and Van since they had one table on giard ave. they moved and had to hunt them down but I found them lol. top quality work every time and all ways very friendly. They can get crowded at times depends on the day. Parking is the only issue. If you feel like a brisk walk I suggest parking at 69st garage and walk over. But keep some quarters for the meter, the salon is in a mini shopping center. So customer from other business can take up the parking spaces"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I originally found Salon XQuisite with a Living Social coupon 4 years ago, and I instantly felt at home. Michael and Natalie are both excellent stylists. I have found them both to be friendly and will go out of their way to meet their clients' needs. I have received many services including cuts, color, highlights, and keratin treatment. I have always been 100% satisfied with the outcome and would without hesitation, recommend this salon to anyone who is looking for an excellent stylist with top notch customer service skills."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"My daughter and I had a couples massage with Helen. We both enjoyed the ambiance and the staff. 

If you are looking for a great massage, this is the place to go. We will definitely be back.I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was a walk-in, but I was not greeted at all. They told me to pick my color and I was seated immediately. The tech did a good job"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Horrible Holiday experience.  I had an appointment with the owner of the salon for a gel manicure.  The salon is a nice, clean and modern looking.  I was greeted by a young man who seemed to be a little more than happy to be there.  He had no idea what he was doing.  I picked out a color and the man who did my manicure did a very good job.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Kelly Markley at Blink Beauty Bar & Spa. I have had my hair cut by both hair and makeup artists and I am always very happy with the results. The atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. It is a very relaxing environment. I have had my hair and makeup done by Nicole and she is excellent. I have also had my hair and makeup done by Jessica and they both did a great job! I highly recommend this place.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"We booked an appointment to go to the salon and they fit me in for a cut and color. I had an appointment with Melissa, who was fantastic! She listened to what I wanted and did a great job. I will definitely be going back!I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on a Saturday afternoon."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"My nail tech Jay is amazing. I came in for a full set of acrylics and he was so sweet and very detailed. The process took about 20 minutes, which is okay, but it was well worth it. I'm a loyal customer for life and I'll be coming back soon.I've been going to the same barber for over 3 years now and I've never been disappointed.  This shop has a nice atmosphere and they do a great job. "

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I was lost after my last visit and the girl at the front desk was rude and rude. I wasn't told the price until after I told her I was unhappy with the color and that it was my fault. She even said it was a mistake. I don't know how this place works. I will never go back. I'm very disappointed and will never recommend this place to anyone. I will be cancelling my membership and tell my friends about this place.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was the first appointment of the day, and my experience was wonderful. The entire staff seemed bright, cheery, and ready to work. Everyone was so warm & welcoming to not only me, but my 4 year old son as well. I have stiletto nails, and the technician shaped & sized them perfectly. She also didn't try and sway me from my stance on not liking gel top coats, even though that obviously means more money for her. The prices were more than fair for the quality of work, and I will definitely return back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The staff are talented but the actual salon is anything but comfortable or relaxing. Something about the acoustics makes it so loud and between talking music and hair dryers it's too overwhelming. There are times where every chair is filled (and then some) which makes a small place feel even more crowded. Lastly, the chairs are so uncomfortable. It's fine for a haircut but not when you are getting color. I would love if they could work towards a more comfortable peaceful experience. I love my hair, I just don't like spending my time there."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Was a walk-in customer and the front desk receptionist was polite and was able fit me in. I was soon met by Rachel who showed me to her room. The place is immaculate and the wax is different and so less painful than traditional waxing. Rachel explained the process in detail. Couldn't have been more pleased with the results and Rachel was professional, courteous and above all else friendly and knowledgeable. She knows how to deliver good customer service."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I was very disappointed with the poses that were given! Each women is shaped different. I was given the same poses as previous customer. I wanted more booty shots instead of front shots but the photographer avoided my opinions and did whatever they were use to. I was not allowed to review pics. I felt like I waisted my time and money! They focused more on a pose than a facial expression. Nice pose but stupid expressions. I felt rushed the entire time! This was my 1st  and last experience at this photo shoot!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"If you are looking for a great hair stylist, Georgia is it! She is very knowledgeable, has great talent and a beautiful personality. I had the Yuko Japanese straightening and it turned out more than perfect. Georgia takes her time to do every detail just right and it's sooooo worth it! My hair now is beautiful, manageable and low maintenance. I am looking forward to going to Georgia from now on for all my hair care needs....Can't wait to get it colored, her work is amazing!!!! Thank you Georgia, you are truly a great artist."
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"Went in last night at 8PM. Guy cutting my hair reeked of alcohol, slurring his words, nodding off, wanted to cut my hair different than what I told him, then kept forgetting how I told him to cut my hair. After going back and forth and he clearly not in a state to cut anyone's hair I told him to stop cutting my hair and he needed to sober up. Been going here for close to a year now and have never had such an ugly experience. Disgusted that the franchise would allow such behavior."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Very unhappy with my experienced here. They only care about the bottom dollar, which is the dollar. This place has turned into a factory of cosmetic procedures. In fact, they have a whole new section just for cosmetic procedures which would be fine if they had good customer service, and good results. I spent several hundred dollars for a simple procedure of getting a spot removed and some veins removed... zero improvement.  When I called, I was told I needed to spend more money, and come back in! Forget it, I'll go somewhere else."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I really don't understand all of the hate the staff is getting - I have been coming here for quite awhile and have always felt welcome and valued.  I have never not been greeted immediately after walking in, and after just a few visits, the friendly and courteous staff knew who I was.  And on top of that, they do the best pedicures around!  Also, Dan has done the best French manicure I have ever had, hands down.  This is a fantastic salon and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I was referred to the center by my PCP and presented the paperwork at my first visit. Instead of seeing a doctor as expected I was seen by a PA every time I went. She was a very nice person and very knowledgeable,  but none of the 5 times I went over the course of 3 months did they ever suggest that I see one of the doctors. She was unable to rid me of my skin problem or diagnosis it after several biopsy. I have since found a REAL dermatologist to go to!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Meh, is definitely the best way to describe this nail place.  The service was rushed, the woman who apparently runs the business is very loud and pushy.  This is to be expected at nail places of this caliber but she was especially so.  They didn't have gel options so you must use the acrylic if you are looking for a filler on your nails.  For the most part she was gentle, the price was right and the nails looked fine after she was done.  Not good or great, just fine."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Professional, knowledgeable, courteous service, and a real professional. I love my hair! I just moved here from Los Angeles and I am so glad I found this place. The owner, Holly, is extremely personable and very welcoming. The shop is very clean and the staff is very friendly. They also offer a discount to save money on the future visits! I will definitely be returning!I just went there to get a pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Editing my review and changing it to 3 stars because I was a little hesitant to write this review.

I had a fabulous experience at this salon! I got a great cut and color by Lauren and it was amazing. I am extremely picky about my hair and Lauren did an amazing job. She really took the time to get to know me and gave me a great cut. I will definitely be coming back!I used to love this place but after a few bad"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"My husband's barber moved so I thought I would try him out. 

The shop is very clean and the barbers are very friendly. The barbers are all very professional and nice. They take their time and make sure you're happy. I was very impressed.

They also have a great line of products and are reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this shop.We came here for a couples massage and were very happy. We enjoyed it a lot"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I had a wonderful experience here. The owner, Nancy, did a great job on my pedicure and manicure. I will definitely be back!I have been a customer for years. They are friendly and efficient. I am always pleased with my service. I always get the gel mani. I have never had to wait long and have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my appointment.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Terrible!!! I was in a hurry to get out of there but they were so rude I was just sitting there waiting for the nail tech to finish and then the tech who did my nails kept telling me to get out of there. I was extremely upset. This was my first time coming here and I was looking for a place to go and I had to wait 30 minutes for my turn. They didn't even bother to ask me if I wanted any color or shape.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,This was probably the worst experience I have ever had. I will not be going back. I've been going to the same place for over a year now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and they always look so great. They offer a great deal of specials and I've never had to wait long at all.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Received a very young girl who did my nails and she was rude. When I asked her to please do a shape, she said, ""it is okay"". I'm a very picky person and I told her to just paint my nails. She then proceeded to tell me that I would need a gel manicure. I told her I had to do it at home so I could get home. She had to take off the gel and go to the back to finish it"

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"First, as a former Director of Massage Envy in Nashville, I have always been a fan of a massage. The front desk staff is always friendly and welcoming. I go to Rheumatoid and he is a true professional. I have always had great experiences at the massage studio. I have tried several therapists in the past and have always had a great experience. I have had many different therapists and all have been excellent."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I have mixed feelings towards Happy Foot. The first time I went in there it was the best manicure I had ever received - and only $25!  This time however, I didn't have near the same experience. My nails definitely did not turn out as great as the last time & for some reason it was $35 this time, even though I got the exact style with a different color. I am reluctant to go to Happy Foot again if I have to pay $35 for a basic manicure that doesn't even look that great."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been taking my daughter here for years every week to get her nails done.  She loves the dogs, in fact we have one of Sandi's dogs.  The dogs have helped my daughter and her BFF with getting services done since both girls are on the autism spectrum.  The dogs are only there 3 days per week.  If you don't like dogs, but who couldn't love the dogs at the salon, then there are 4 days per week that they aren't there and the salon is open 7 days a week."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The shop caught our interest as we walked through the town. We stopped in to take a closer look. Two of the artists were at the front desk. One didn't address us at all and the we left wishing the other hadn't either. In town for a couple of days, I requested a quote on a tattoo, but was so turned off by the female artist's demeanor and response to me, I wouldn't even consider it - and was moved to leave this review. Nothing speaks louder about your business than how it's customers are treated."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have always liked Dk nails! 
I usually just go here for acrylic manicures and normal pedicures. They always have a lot of workers so there is almost never a wait! Or if there is, it's very short! 
One thing I especially like about DK nails is the cleanliness of the pedicure stations. They have liners on the tubs. I always feel like it is a clean area! 

The prices here are affordable! My normal pedicures are $22 and the service is phenomenal and very relaxing! 

DK nails is my favorite nail spa in the area!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"After hearing my friend talk about True Color for the past year, I finally decided to check it out. I'm so glad I did. I walked in & they took me right away. Everything is clean and they even line the pedicure tubs with a disposable liner. Ken did a great job of fixing up my feet/toes after a long winter of neglect. They massage your legs & feet with oil and also with hot stones. While drying, they massage your shoulders. $20 for a regular pedicure with that kind of service?  Can't beat that!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Recently I've been looking for a salon to go to regularly & this may be the place for me! I arrived earlier than scheduled but was immediately washed/blow dried by Alexandria. She was very polite, efficient & gentle with my hair which is a plus for me!!! Tanisha was my stylist for the day & I have to say I am extremely pleased with my end results....she has brought my hair back to life!!!All the staff members were very polite, the atmosphere was very relaxing & the prices were very reasonable!!! I will be coming again!!!"
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"I went to this location to get my nails done as I was in the local area and had been to this place before. I will admit; they do a very good job and the outcome looks very nice although they aren't very social at this location. They rarely engage in any form of conversation unless it is among themselves which can be a bit awkward. Overall, I do like their work and will more than likely continue going to this location as it is nearby and to be honest, I don't really mind the quiet."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I chose this barber shop because I wanted a straight razor shave and haircut. I arrived too late to get the shave and I was bummed but the haircut was fantastic. I really have to give them five stars. I could see as I waited the attention to detail they gave every customer. I got an excellent haircut and my only gripe is that I don't live in St. Louis. It'll be months before I get back here, too bad because they are on my short list of great barbers."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Said three times I didn't want dude to cut my beard and boom he took my shit down to a 1. And cut my sides when I told him not to. Like it's pretty clear where I've been cutting the sides and where I've been growing it and ignored that line entirely for the sake of blending that I didn't. Dude getting a cut across from however was probably getting the best cut I've ever seen. Skinny Hispanic dude in some loud sneakers was cutting his hair. If I do return it'll be for that guy
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Make sure to not give a bunch of time to make sure your nails are just the way you want them.I had a fabulous experience at this salon!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"This review is for Mary, who did an amazing job on my hair! I have been going to Mary for over a year now, and she is the best hair stylist I've ever had. I have been to many salons, and I have never had a stylist that knew how to cut my hair. I have also had my hair cut by Mary for color and cut. I always get compliments on my hair. Mary is very creative and knows her stuff."

I always get a massage with the pedicure and it's perfect every time.I love this place. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. I go to Cindy and she's great. I've had great experiences with my nails. They have a lot of colors to choose from and always offer great suggestions."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I've been coming here for years. The only reason I've gone back is because I don't like the way they do nails. The girl that does my nails does a great job and does a good job. It's a little pricey for a manicure and pedicure but I would recommend it.I have been going to this place for over 3 years. I've had great experiences every time. This time I went for my first Brazilian wax. I was nervous because I
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Nellie is the stylist I go to and she does hair magic everything I visit. I came in with a dark brunette and faded pink bayalage ombre. My end goal was bright cool tone blonde, we got pretty close for our first sitting for this hair project. The integrity of my hair is still there and feels super soft and strong. She's always really sweet when I come in and is upfront about what is obtainable within one appointment. She is a star in the industry and a life saver for all of my drastic hair changes"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This place is the best, I have been to a bunch of nail salons in the area and none are quite as good as Babi nails. It's pretty standard when you walk in and doesn't look much different from any neighborhood nail salon, but they really care about their customers here.
My pedicures are always really well done and usually last me a month, they take their time and give awesome foot massages. What's also nice is they only have opi or Essie polish options, no cheap china glaze stuff. They also are masters at waxing eyebrows too."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I am from TX (which is where Woodhouse started).  I've always liked the Nola location.  Even though parking is at your own risk there. MOST therapists are really good.  The ""quiet"" room is far from quiet and is too cold for a relaxing atmosphere.  The treatment rooms are nice, and I love the products they offer for sale.  This a good spa and one worthy of trying. And if you get a fantastic therapist, share!  I've not had a great therapist there the last few times, but I love the spa."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Went to the Sports Clip at Clearwater Mall. They were open until 5PM on Sunday's. We got there at about 4:15 and Stephanie pretty much threw a fit because they close at 5pm and they had a 35 minute wait time. I deal with customers all day have for about 40 years now. If a customer walks in at one minute till closing they get the same treatment as everyone else. Well their lost, Super Cuts down the road who also close at 5PM had no problem cutting our hair, and did just as good or better!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"The first time I walked in this place, there were 3 barbers and 2 customers.  I took a seat and was approached by one of the barbers.  He asked if I had an appointment and I told him I didn't.  He did offer to book an appointment for me.  Apparently, they flat out don't accept walk ins.  I would think for a first time client, they would try to accommodate me, especially when one barber is idle!  I left with a negative impression of this establishment and doubt if I'll return."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,Walk-ins Welcome. is really not true. I walked in and sat for 40 minutes before one of the 3 stylists who finished up a client she'd been working on since I arrived said that she had to work on someone who had an appointment but arrived 20 minutes after I did. She did say I could wait for another 10 or 15 minutes for one of the other two stylists to finish. Seriously? This walk-in walked out! They've never been staffed well. They are inconsistent in service. Prices have increased greatly since they first opened.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Another Image Hair Studio by Pailik is my favorite place to get my hair service. I feel like, I finally found a place that preserves the quality of your hair and provides tips on how to have healthy hair. If you are familiar with Vidal Sassoon Cut and Color, that is Pailik she does an incredible and very precise cut and color. Finally for the first time, I am ecstatic with the quality of my hair after a color and cut. No Thinning shear and No Razor! Pailik is my stylist and her work is impeccable.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place is extremely nice, clean, and the staff is very nice and welcoming. However, it took them over 2 and a half hours to do my eyelash extensions, which I wasn't mad about because I know these things take time, but I was expecting a lot more than what I got. The extensions they put on are so thin and light. I have dark hair so when I got up to look at my lashes, I could barely even see the extensions. But if you like the extremely natural look then you will like this place!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place is great and the service was amazing... besides the random chatter here and there, it was very peaceful. I was so tense when I came in and super relaxed by the time the massage was over. The masseuse focused on my shoulders which was the most tense. One key note! I would recommend calling in to book an appointment as the times book up quick, but if you're in the area they also accept walk ins too but you might have to wait a little bit if all the masseuses are working on someone else."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Sapphire salon is excellent. I go to the same stylist for about a year now and I'm always pleased with the results. I am always able to get an appointment when I need it. I have had several stylists and I can always get an appointment with Sara. She is also the best. She is very personable and always remembers me. I highly recommend her!I love this place. It's so clean and the people are so nice.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I just stopped in to see if I could get a pedicure for my daughter's birthday. They said they had a seat, but they didn't have any available. I was seated with a male technician. He did a horrible job. He filed my nails so far they have chipped. I will never go back. I'm very disappointed and will never recommend this place to anyone. I will be telling everyone to do it!I am new to the area and needed a haircut"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I told the lady who was doing my nails that I was in a hurry and I needed a pedicure.  The lady who did my nails seemed annoyed that I was in a hurry.  I told her that I wanted a manicure.  I told her I had never been there before.  She said I could just get a pedicure.  I said no.  I went to the store and was told that they didn't have a color selection so I went
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"UPDATE: 

Went back to Lauren for a touch up and she did a great job. She was friendly and knowledgeable. I had a lot of hair and she was very honest.

I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"from the pictures I saw here. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the owner was so sweet. 

However, the massage was not great. The masseuse was very nice and seemed to be good at what she does. I was charged for the 30 minute massage and a 20 minute massage. I did get a 60 minute massage with the spa pedicure. I was charged $70 for a massage and an additional $30 for a 60 minute pedicure"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I went in for a pedicure and the lady was rude and didn't even ask how I wanted my nails painted. I asked her to get the gel polish off and she did that. She was so rude and even said it was fine. I was charged $45 for the gel polish. I will never go back and will tell all my friends not to go here. I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I've tried a few nail salons and this one is by far the best. I go every 2 weeks and have had a great experience. The staff is very friendly and always do a great job. I have been to many nail salons and this is by far my favorite. The only downside is that they have a huge selection of nail polish. I've never had to wait long. I just went there with my sister for a pedicure and it was well worth the price
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I had another salon completely ruined my hair. It was a mess. I called the salon and spoke to someone at the front desk. They told me that they couldn't take me and that it was my fault. I spoke to someone on the phone and was told that they would have to take my name and number. I was very disappointed and told them that I had to pay $10 for my hair. They tried to charge me $10 for the color that I had not even gotten
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I have been getting my hair done by the owner and I will never go anywhere else!  The owner is super friendly and the salon is beautiful and the atmosphere is so relaxed and relaxing.  They offer complimentary drinks and even wine!

I have been going to Angel
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I recently visited Jolie Salon and Spa for the first time, for a haircut and highlights. Though I was using a Groupon, I was never once reminded of this, or made to feel any less special than a full-paying customer. My ""junior designer"" Lisamarie was as good (or better!) than far more experienced stylists at other salons. She did a phenomenal job with both my cut and color, all the while listening to my input. I won't hesitate to return at the full price, and plan to make Jolie (and Lisamarie!) my regular salon and stylist going forward."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place has made every other place I've been to seem inferior. I have never had a bad experience. Leona the owner went out of her way to stay late tonight and do a gorgeous ombré dip manicure on me (on a Friday night!) I am absolutely in love with how my nails look. The whole staff is so sweet and bubbly, the turned my horrible week completely around! I have been to Polish multiple times now and every time my powder dip manicure has lasted at least 3 weeks. If you haven't tried it yet, you should!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"We went to Nashville for my friend's bachelorette party. Since we did a nicer dinner Friday night, I thought blow outs and her getting her make up done would be the perfect Saturday afternoon event. We all loved it!! The Dry House is so cute! The bride's make up was gorgeous! One of the bridesmaids had her hair done similarly to how she wants it for the wedding and loved it! Thanks so much for letting us come in and have mimosas while getting a little pampered! Absolutely something I will come back for if ever in Nashville!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,I have been coming here since January and I really love my stylist Morgan! He's so kind and gives me great cuts! I have curly hair so it has taken me a while to find a good stylist - I always leave here looking fabulous and my hair still looks good when I do it at home the next day. The prices are very reasonable and they even offer a new discount. They carry kevin Murphy as well as Neuma products which is really a great line that will last you months. I will definitely be coming back!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Jasmine is awesome! She called me back not long after I left a message and was able to get me in to see her very quickly. 

I expressed where I was having pain but she definitely knows what she's doing so I just let her take the lead.

She tells you what she's doing at all times and how she's working on a particular part of the body and its benefits.

She just has a great energy about her and I left feeling refreshed. By the next morning I had no more headache and definitely more energy! I'll be back."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Absolutely AMAZING! ! I lhave lived here for over 2 years and have just found out about it now. This is a must do for a girls day or monthly relaxation. Cocktails are delish and the service is beyond amazing. Everyone is so friendly and my toes turned out fabulous. Also got the cutest bag while I was there. I took my niece with me and she got the little miss package. She had so much fun and they were great with her. This should be your first choice for pampering. Plus you can book your appointment online!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I just moved back to the area from TX where SNS/dip is king, and I wanted to try Lux since they do dip nails too. Honestly, she shaped my nails perfectly! I was shocked because I've liked my nails before, but I showed a reference picture and it's the first time someone actually matched it. The dip was also super smooth, no divots, and they even helped me pick a pretty pink. $65 for dip with tips is a good price in this town. The salon is clean and feels open. Great downtown location."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I saw some really unfortunate reviews about Lily's which is always sad, but I'm here to talk about my own experience. I came in with a bunch of my girlfriends and we all ended up getting our nails done. I got the deluxe package manicure which came with the paraffin wax. I had a great time conversing with the woman who was painting my nails, and in fact, she did a great job. I would definitely recommend this place based on my experiences, because I had a pleasant time.

It's definitely hidden- it's by the Santa Barbara chicken ranch!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Best nail salon I have been to!! As soon as we walked in we were greeted and sat. My sister had homecoming that night so we wanted to feel special. This place made us feel that. So many color options and you get to pick them in your seat to save time! We had great conversations with our nail artists, usually they won't talk to you. They also have complimentary beverages, my sister was served a soda while I was served a glass of wine! What a wonderful way to freeze time. Thank y'all for making us welcome!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Came here with two other people for our scheduled appointment and there were only two people working so we had to wait awhile. The salon itself is filthy with old tools, odd decor, dirty chairs/couches and old nail polish. I'm sorry but when I get a manicure, I do not want NYC brand nail polish used and that was abundant in their selection. The manicure itself wasn't terrible but I'll be surprised if it doesn't chip. Also please see my pictures and the rude signs on the wall to Groupon customers. A little ridiculous if you ask me."

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Appointment was at 3 they had an appointment with the same person.  When I arrived I was told that my appointment was at 3:00 and that the appointment was at 3:00.  I was told that I would be charged for a manicure and pedicure.  I was told that I was charged for the service I had booked and that I was charged for the service I had booked.  I was told that if I did not have a certain appointment I would have
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,This place is awesome. I go to the same girl every two weeks. She is the best! I highly recommend this place! I am a regular and have had a few great massages but it's worth it. I have been a loyal customer for years and always receive compliments on my nails. They always do a great job and are reasonably priced. I highly recommend this place!I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Another amazing experience...I've been going to Salon Esperanza for over 10 years for my color, cut and make-up, and each time marvelous results.
Andrew is phenomenal with color and has always done my color, low and highlights.
Minga is an amazing stylist, going from a short to a long hair style, she knows the style that suites me best. 
Eleanor (PARIS Cosmetics), by far is a make-up ARTIST, love the variety she has  of her own line. She's incredible with eyebrow shaping and make-up application. 
Everyone is incredibly friendly, makes you feel welcome and overall a GREAT experience every time."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS! This was the worst experience. My daughter and I both chose pictures of acrylic nail styles off their own website that they claimed they could do and we got nothing close to it. They were dismissive unprofessional and overpriced. They charged me $100 for business length nails, $100 for medium length nails and $150 for my youngest daughters nails because they painted a black design on them. I am sooo upset. I cannot get over it. DO NOT GO THERE!!!! I wish I could post pics you honestly would be as disgusted as me."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Sara is amazing! I have seen Sara at IRevive onseveral different occasions for chemical peels, Botox, and most recently for lip filler injections. Prior to my most recent visit with Sara, I was going to another provider at a well-known MedSpa in Nashville. My lips never came out proportional amongst a few other issues. Honestly looking back, I should have started with Sara from. 

Sara takes her time and is patient (I tend to ask too many questions). I trust her 100% as she is truthful and very straight forward. Give Sara a try, you will not regret it!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"What can I say....Trevor was awesome. I went in for a nose piercing and decided to get that and my tongue pierced. He was very nice, informative, showed concern for my issues and put me at ease. The process was really quick and I only felt a quick pinch both times. He covered everything with me during the process and on piercing care and the healing time. Even after all of that I forgot and I was able to call with questions about piercing care and they were friendly and very responsive. I would definitely recommend all star tattoo."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Requested and paid for a Spa pedicure and the foot massage was skipped because there was only 1 massage therapist available on a Saturday afternoon. I had to specifically request the massage despite the fact that it came with the massage as listed. The technician lacked the skills to complete a basic gel manicure and attempted to fix my nails several times. After 3 hours, I had to return the next day for another two hours for my gel manicure to be fixed, while encountering an attitude by the staff. I definitely would not come back to this location."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Okay so all the positive reviews so far have been MEN. Face It, we know what kind of business she's running here. My BESTIE and I needed a massage. Her rates were reasonable. When we arrived one of the ""massage therapist"" was pissed and  started arguing something in her language. Anyways long story short ,During the massage she kept pulling down my underwear. I had to tell her three times no, the same happened to my friend as well. This experience was mortifying ....it was horrible. This place is not legit unless your looking for a ""happy ending""."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,As a long term customer - I was treated poorly . They put me at a table began the soak off of my Dip - and left me there 50 mins while the tech went and did another customers pedi and mani. No one said anything to me and when I spoke up they spoke another language in front of me and they moved me to another tech who rushed through and give me VERY bumpy nails.  No apology- in fact when I told them how I felt- they act like they have no command of English .
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I will never go to this place to get my nails done anymore. Their price is so high and they don't even honor the 15% discount offer which they have a sign for. I walked to the store, confirmed the price of shellac and pedi and told them that I have $15 certificate to use. Front lady confirmed that I can use my certificate and calculated on a paper how much would be the remaining amount to pay. At the end, They charged me more only because I used a $15 certificate. Worst customer service I have ever had."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was a primary care patient here for several years but they've shifted their focus so heavily on cosmetic surgery from women's health that I've left. I also had a very negative and judgmental experience with one of the providers and don't recommend seeking women's ob/gyn services here. Most concerning, they've recently started promoting the ""O shot"" which is a bogus and potentially quite harmful service developed by someone who is now banned by the FDA as a clinical investigator. For more on the problems with the ""O shot"" please read this article by GYN, Dr. Jen Gunter https://drjengunter."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I got in ahead of a long line that began to accumulate behind me. There were two girls working giving cuts, and the guy in after me was a repeat customer. Since it was my first time they upgraded me to the MVP cut which included a hot face towel, shampoo and scalp massage (in a vibrating chair) and additional back massage.

Overall, I loved the cut and I'm usually pretty picky. Environment was friendly and you don't need a reservation. I put it a few notches above my salon I sometimes visit to get a similar type of deal."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been coming here since it opened and have gone to several different stylists. Everyone does a good blow out but Pearl is the best, hands down. You can request stylists through the app... do yourself a favor and request her! I schedule weekly blow outs with her and I come in, she knows exactly what I want and she always delivers a great experience. I never have to wait for her and always get a blow out that seriously lasts 4 days! Great experience, great location in the heart of soho and easy scheduling via their app!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I just moved to the area, so I'm on the hunt for a good nail salon. This was just an average nail salon. If you're looking for a deep scrub pedicure with a good massage, this is not the place. But if your toenails just need a cleanup and a polish, this will do. I got a gel manicure and she did a pretty good job. The nail/gel polish selection was also good. It's not the fanciest place and parking sucks. But if you're in the area and don't have time to go anywhere else, this place will do."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"After spending an absurd amount of money, I feel like I need to make a reservation to see the owner.I had a fabulous experience at this salon! I got a great cut and blow dry and was in and out in a perfect amount of time. I will be back soon!I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. They make you feel very welcome and comfortable. I love the color scheme and the staff is so kind and professional."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,this is my go-to spot!I have been going to this nail salon for years. I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the best one. They do a great job and are friendly. I have been a loyal customer for years and always get compliments on my nails. They always do a great job and are always very quick and efficient. I've also seen a couple of different people get their nails done there and they all do an amazing job.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"MONIQUE ROCKS! 
She has years of experience and she has a good eye for hair. She does the best hair color and cuts. I am a very loyal client and have had great results. The salon is beautiful and the staff is very friendly.I have been going to this nail salon for years and have never had a bad experience. I have had a lot of pedicures and manicures and my nails have never been bad. The pedicure includes hot stones,"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This is my favorite nail salon in the area! The pedicure chairs are amazing! They are so nice and the staff are so friendly. The salon is clean and the staff is so friendly. I highly recommend this place!I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was a walk-in, but I was not greeted at all. They told me to come back later in the day if I wanted to wait. I waited 30 minutes for my manicure"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I had a great  experience here and the staff is very friendly. My pedicure was done by two different people and I am very pleased with the results. I was very pleased with the customer service and the result. I will be back.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes before my appointment time
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Been a Mesa Barbers customer for a couple years now. I always leave happy and satisfied. 

The only thing I don't like is that the barbers don't really listen to what you want and are in a hurry. If you are going to spend a few minutes waiting for your appointment to be done, the barbers are not there anymore. I think they need more training and just want to keep the shop as it is.I've been a client of this salon for"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,Hands down the worst nail salon I have ever been to. My nails are completely ruined and the girl did not shape them the way I asked and then put gel polish on it. My nails are uneven and look terrible. I'm not from the area but I will never return. I have been a client at this nail salon for over a year. I have never had a bad experience. Today was my first time getting dip powder nails and they did a great job.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Looked for a long while and decided to give it a shot. 

The salon is very cute and clean. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who listened to what I wanted. My stylist was Kim. She was great. She did a great job and I'm very happy with the cut. She also gave me a cute little treat to take home. I'm looking forward to getting a facial next week!I've"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I have been going to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk.  The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly.  

The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I'd heard wonderful things about this place and thought it would be a nice place for a massage. The atmosphere is nice and the people are friendly. The massage was okay. The masseuse was nice and had good pressure. However, it was a little hard to communicate to the masseuse. I felt a little more relaxed the moment I got there. I didn't think the massage was worth it. It was about $90 for a full body massage. I think I'd give it another try"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"My normal nail saloon was closed so I decided to come here for a normal, simple polish change on my toes and they came out so messy! I am so disappointed because there are missed spots on my nail and there is nail polish all over them. I had to ask the lady to fix them two times and when i put the flashlight over them in my car I saw how terrible they look. Beware! I honestly should have and could have painted them better at home... i don't know who would send their clients out like this either..."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Dream TEAM!!! I've been going here since they opened a few years ago and multiple friends have join me now as well! At least 20+ friends of mine get their hair done here... that's how amazing they are! Shannon Stibolt is my stylist. She is also the owner and a total bad ass business owner, stylist, and mom! I've done all kinds of styles with her. From purple long hair, to a short blonde pixie cut! I get compliments from random people asking to take pics of my cuts/color all the time!!! So yeah... this place is where to go!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Beautiful salon. I have a tight budget right now but didn't want to skimp on my haircut since I hadn't gotten one in over 6 months. I just asked for a level 1 stylist and got placed with Emylee Cage. I got my appointment for the same day! She did a great job and it was only $35 for a wash, cut, and dry/style. I was offered lemon water when I checked in, and Emylee was right on time for my appointment. The service didn't feel rushed and the shampoo/conditioning treatment was amazing. The products used were the highest quality."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Great place. Quiet relaxing atmosphere conducive to pampering treatment. Great attention to detail and always aim to please. Walk ins welcome but you take your chances because the salon is busy so the time you choose may or may not work. For that reason I always make an appointment.  I get weekly French manicures and prefer Youngs to every other nail salon in the area.  I also like it here because it is a mini UN - what America is supposed to be about with an open door to immigrants aiming for a better life. Everyone is welcome.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Having just moved to the area I was nervous about  finding a new salon and stylist. I had the same person or the last 20 years so I was nervous about getting someone new. I was pleasantly  surprised! I had a consultation with Penny. She asked what I wanted, cut and color wise and listened to everything I said. When I went back for my appointment I couldn't have been happier. She nailed it. My color was exactly what I wanted and my cut was perfect. I highly recommend Rock your Locks! Great salon and very nice ladies."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I am still coming to see Valerie .I cannot say ENOUGH good things about her!! If you have had a bad massage before and you're not sure that you want to try somebody new because you're feeling worried , I would definitely say just go ahead and try her...you will not be disappointed!! I used to have unbearable shoulder and neck pain from tight muscles and knots. I'm happy to say that I'm on the path to wellness , it's very rare that I get them anymore and when I do I know where to go to get massaged out!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,After thining for 5 years about the tattoo i wanted to get to remember my grandfather i finally settled on something super simple with nice clean lines. I was talking to a friend about it and she recommened Nick. She was spot on not only is he a rad artist he is super gentile. I got my inner bicep done and everyone said it would hurt a alot but honestly it didnt. Anyway I LOVE what Nick did he took what I came in with and made it even better. Moral of the story GO TO NICK because he rocks!!
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I don't know if I love this place more because of the quick service or the inexpensive pricing! I've been getting my eyebrows threaded by Sonia for a while now and can you believe she only charges $3?! There's rarely a wait and she's open 7 days a week and in her words, ""regardless of snowstorm, thunderstorm, or any bad weather condition!"" Sonia does a great job threading and provides service with a smile - what else can you ask for? Easy parking in the area as well which adds to the stress free experience. I'll def continue to support!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"The DREAM TEAM: Gabby and Thomas!! I went to Thomas for a cut and he did such an amazing job. My layers look so good and my hair feels amazing. He gave it LIFE! Afterwards, I went to gabby to get my color done and she suggested to go for a new color. I trusted her and she was NOT wrong. My hair looks natural but with a great purple tint. I've never loved a color more in my life. Those two are the best and I will continue coming back to them for my color and cut."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I've been coming here for awhile now, & I love it. Not 5 stars just because appointments aren't available. That's okay. I love the service here. Not a long wait at all. I get highlights done and the color I desire is spot on. I got a trim a couple days ago and she didn't take off a lot like what usually happens at other places. SEE LAUREN!!!! Knows exactly what you want for coloring to your skin tone and is SUPER friendly. I'm not much of a talker, but she makes you feel super comfortable."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I will be moving to Tampa soon, as I've heard about this place a couple of times. I had an excellent experience here. I got the basic manicure and it was amazing. I came in with no problem looking like a college student. My nail technician was very friendly and thorough. I will definitely be back!They are amazing!! I have been to a lot of nail salons and this one is the best I have ever been to. They always offer great service."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Had a wonderful experience here! We had the pleasure of getting pedicures and manicures. We both loved our nails and the people were so friendly and the atmosphere was so relaxed. The massage chairs were awesome and the massage chairs were perfect. The manicure was amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!I've been to several locations over the years and this is by far the best. I had a very bad experience with the hair stylist and a group of people that went there to
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Just had a blowout from here. The owner, Nancy, did a great job! I got a haircut from her and it looks great. 

I think the place is pretty nice, and it's convenient to be in a strip mall.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes before my appointment time"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"My father and I spend time here and we love it!

The staff is friendly and we always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed.  

I think the place is pretty nice and clean.  It's a little pricey for a manicure and pedicure but I would definitely recommend it.

I've also had my eyebrows waxed by Anna and she is great!  She does a great job with my eyebrows.  I have a hard time finding someone that can do them"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"Got the groupon for $25 (not including the massage which included a 30 minute massage) and the girl who did it had a bad attitude.  The lady who did the massage was pretty nice, but I didn't get the massage I was expecting.  I don't know how this place gets a 2 star because I didn't get a 60 minute massage on my first day.  I didn't get a full hour or half of that.  I don't like paying for massages and"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,This place could easily be better. The staff is friendly and professional. The pedicure was thorough and thorough.  The place is clean and modern.  The only reason I gave this place a 4 is because of the fact that they use the tubs to remove calluses.  I was looking forward to it and it seemed to me that the tubs were so dirty.  I was quite surprised to see that there was an empty tub.  It's very unprofessional to have to wait
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Really disappointed.  I got a dip manicure and a pedicure and my nails were done by a different person.  I am not sure how the manager was so rude and made me feel uncomfortable.  It was clear she was upset about my nails and that she was not interested in doing a good job.  I did not feel the need to ask for a refund.  I will never go back to this place.  The only reason I gave a 2 star is because they do have
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I prepaid for 3 massages and a free 1/2 pedicure for my daughter.  When she called the spa to ask for a refund, the manager told her it was fine to go ahead and pay.  She said it was fine.  I was still waiting for her to pay.  I was also told it would be 60-minute and I was told it would be 60.  This was not true.  The massage was good but the tech was not trained in the massage"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Awful.  Just awful.  Not worth the money.  I will not be going back.  I will be finding a new place.  Not worth the money.This place is amazing! I came in on a Tuesday to get a gel manicure. I got a gel manicure with gel polish. The woman who did my nails did a great job and I loved how she took her time. I will definitely be back!I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"My sister and I came here for the first time and we will definitely be back! We got the deluxe pedicure and a full set with gel polish. We both received a great pedicure and manicure. We will definitely be back!I had a wonderful experience at this salon. I had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back! They are very professional and take their time to make sure you are happy with your nails. The salon is clean, very comfortable, and the staff is"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I made a reservation at 5 for lux because I needed to get to center city by 615. They promised me I'd be done by 545. I was just seen at 550 so waited almost an hour later than they said I'd be completely done to even be seen, and all they could do before I really needed to leave by 6 or else I'd be late to my appointment at 615 was take off my old gel and then left me like this and I had to pay $20 just to take it off. Worst service ever. Never going back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place has the best deal I have ever heard of! I got a 30 minute facial and a 60 minute massage for $50.00 Granted, I don't know much about facials, but I definitely looked better after it was done. Plus, Dawn gave me a bunch of free samples and told me where I could get products at the cheapest prices; meaning, she didn't try to sell me a bunch of expensive items I didn't need. 

Also, Tiffany, the massage therapist, did a great job on my back, especially my lower back. I felt soooo much better after I left there!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I am soooo happy that I found this salon! I am getting married and two weeks and Lee has once again Slayed. He is Amazing and my hair has never looked better. I also got extensions put in for the first time and it was the BEST experience and well worth the money! The owner took the time to do my extensions. They really are a family there and help each other to make sure you get the best experience! My hair is very long, even before extensions, and they did great! This is the only place I will ever go!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Bao Tran, licensed aesthetician has been helping me with my skincare and doing my laser treatments for what seems like forever. Bao is extremely knowledgable about her field and her gentle yet fun demeanor has made treatments that should really be uncomfortable bearable and sometimes even fun :) Bao is always well read on new products and solutions for skincare issues. She helped me with acne, melasma, anti-aging and laser hair removal. I have the utmost trust in Bao. She is extremely professional and always checks in after treatments to make sure I am doing well. I wouldn't trust anyone else."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"From the second I did my consultation from the time I left, every single person I met was amazingly nice & knowledgeable. I will never go to another salon again. It has been weeks since I had my hair colored blue there and it is the exact same shade as when I left the salon. Their prices are extremely reasonable, and they actually listen to their clients! Total strangers stop me in the street to compliment my hair at least 10 times a day! I really can't say enough great things about this salon and I'm excited for my next appointment."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I didn't even want to write this review because I don't want April's schedule to book up, but she's just so good at what she does that I had to say something.


The space is beautiful, and totally my style. No, it's not a super quiet spa playing instrumental music, but to be honest, I prefer the upbeat vibe. April is clearly incredibly talented. The lash lift I received made my lashes look better than I could have ever imagined. April is a beautiful person inside and out and she's just so much fun to be around. Can't wait to go back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,They had me hooked for a few months I am back to my usual wax but I do enjoy the look of threading. They are kind here and do a good job. I have had prior experience from another threading location where she plucked the whole time and ran a string across my face further over charging me so I will say this is the only location I will allow someone to thread. I prefer the owner to thread me she doesn't hurt me. Sometimes threading causes discomfort and redness but the end results are worth it. Fair prices.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I was looking for a place nearby my gym and found this place on Yelp. So glad I came in. I came in at 4:30pm and asked for a pedicure and gel polish removal. They didn't make me feel bad about coming in so close to their 5pm closing time- like most other salons would. The gel polish removal was free! She even filed my nails because one of them was broken. They offer good brands and colors. The foot massage during my pedicure was heavenly. And the decor was cute to boot. This is definitely my new go to spot.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I had a great experience here today. Patricia was accommodating to my time crunch and fit me in a bit later than I had originally scheduled. She was very pleasant when I checked in. Clarissa, the technician, was amazing. Her attention to details was apparent from the start. The salon is impeccably clean. I can not stress that enough. That is a very big deal to me. Everything is sanitized between clients which is wonderful to see -- considering this is not done at other locations. I will definitely be returning. Their online booking system makes things very easy as well!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Five stars so far! I came on a whim because my eyebrows were getting a little crazy. I passed by rows of squeaky clean pedicure tubs and nail stations into the waxing room. It was the cleanest waxing room I've ever seen. They even had a big comfy armchair (as opposed to the uncomfortable desk chairs that other places have) for you to sit in as they wax your brows. The technician was a little hard to understand (and I'm pretty good at Asian accents), but they're very friendly and efficient. The waxing was done in literally 5 minutes."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I believe Can did my hair. I came in with a picture of what I wanted and he executed it perfectly. 

I will definitely be coming back to this place.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and was very satisfied with both the services and the results. However, I have come to this salon for my nails, pedicures and my eyebrows. The techs are very professional and have great attention to detail."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I went in to get a fill and the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I had two nails that were crooked, and they're chipped after only a week. The place was packed when I went, so I came back for a fill and they did not have the workers working. I was also the only one in the shop and they were very rude. They made me feel like I was being treated poorly. They also didn't have a good selection of polishes for me to choose"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"You know that saying, ""you know what you want"" is a understatement.

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  The salon itself is very well kept and the staff are extremely friendly.  The pedicure is very relaxing and relaxing.  The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating.  I also love the fact that they are open on Sundays.  I just went there to get a pedicure.  I have a hard time finding a salon that is"

The only thing that I didn't like was that the nail tech was rushing. My gel manicure was $35. I was looking forward to it and it was a great price.I love this place!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"After only one visit, I noticed an issue with the nail polish on my hands. I went back to get them fixed and the owner, who also works there, told me it was because they had a problem with the polish. I was extremely disappointed. This was my first visit and I will never return. I have to say I will not be coming back. I spent $90+ on a gel manicure and I paid $55 for a regular manicure. I would not recommend this place to anyone"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I have really tried to find a good nail salon in Nashville but I have found the one that is worth the drive. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. The only thing that I do not like is that they try to push you to upgrade or upgrade to the basic pedicure. I have never had to upgrade to a basic pedicure with a basic polish. They have a great selection of colors and the pedicure chairs are all brand new and new. They do have a huge
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"No, no, no!  Had a pedicure done. 

The pedicure was fine.  The woman did a good job.  The manicure was great.  The color selection was limited.  The pedicure was fine.  The manicure was ok.  The woman who did my nails did a good job.  She did a good job.  I just went with the basic manicure.  The girl doing my nails didn't speak much English."
Beauty & Spas,1.0,CG,"Never going there again. Stopped here because I thought it was good. The person who did my pedicure was nice, but the massage was not great. She cut me twice with the tool and she didn't even bother to clean under my nails. I was also not offered a drink. I was also disappointed when I got home. I didn't think they had wine. I just went there to get my nails done and they didn't have a good selection of polishes."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"This massage therapist is the absolute best!  About a year ago I moved from Atlanta to St Petersburg and was so excited to find out that Jim had moved down as well!  When in Atlanta I had used Jim as my exclusive massage therapist for years, and now I can continue to use Jim's services to improve my health and fitness. I can't say it enough, he is a wonderful and talented therapist.  In addition to massage, Jim also provides waxing and facials to his customers.  One massage with Jim and you will be hooked!  Thanks, Jim!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"So, I wondered if I should write a review because everyone else has hit the ""nail"" on the head.  I travel half an hour to Posh because it is well worth it.  My nails look better than ever.  Carol takes time to file them beautifully and uses quality products so that the manicures and pedicures last and look great.  I'm also grateful that there's no TV blaring some ridiculous soap opera but instead she has nice relaxing music playing.  She also does excellent waxing.  The detail she shows in all aspects of her service are exceptional!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have been going to this salon for about 5 yrs. now & I am very happy with the service the Kevin and his crew offer. I can walk in any time of the day and they are always very nice and do a great job on my nails. Anytime someone asks where I get them done I send them to this salon and they have always continued to go there. I just want to say Thank you to Kevin, Jenny and the rest of the staff for always making me feel important and for doing such a great job every time."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Seemed great. Got a gel manicure and a express pedi on saturday, overall happy. The very next day my gel manicure started to chip, when they are supposed to last 2 weeks but i was going to let it go but rhen two days another nail started to peel and is now about to fall off. . When i called to express my concern i was spoken to in an extremely rude was and was not given any solution for my nails and basically rushed off the phone. Needless to say i will never return. I do not recommend this nail salon"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place is the best! I'm visiting from California and I broke a nail and needed it fixed, plus a needed a fill :) they got me in right away and David did my nails. He listened to exactly what I wanted and exceeded my expectations. He did a better job then the nail salon at home! Plus their prices are even better! At home I pay $60 or a fill including tip and today I paid half that and they look better! Very clean and very friendly. If only I lived here it would be my go to! Thank you again!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've been going to Lisa for years! She used to be at a salon around the corner but then opened this place up. She hand files (which I didn't know I cared about until I started going to her. My nails are still really healthy even after getting gels for the last 6-7 years), can do just about any design you want, and gets you in and out (like I'm talking under an hour). They use stamping to do the designs which are so quick and come out so clean. The salon also has such a cute vibe."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place is Langhorne's best kept secret.
Right up there with the Bellagio Spa in Las Vegas for a fraction of the price. 
 I had a deep tissue massage and I can say I started to feel in areas that I did not realize were numb from an old injury. I was healing days after the massage was over. It felt like a good workout without the work. Blood flow had been restored to previously blocked places on my neck and back. Excellent work by well trained hands A bargain at 55 for one hour needless to say, I will be back."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I love this salon! I moved to Rochester, NY so it's hard for me to get back to NJ. Their staff is the best! They are perfectionist at their jobs. Lou is great at cut and highlights my family members go to him and I go to Beth! She's great! Beth follows original highlights and is a perfectionist! I'm missing this salon very much from Western NY! They do beautiful updos too. I felt like I had red carpet hair for my wedding. In the picture I didn't mean to say ""guys"". I meant to type ""cuts"". Salon Pure has great employees."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"When my normal stylist left the salon I'd been going to for years, I panicked. I saw the reviews online for this salon and gave it a try. I have very thick, natural hair and I was looking for someone with experience cutting African American hair. My stylist, Tye, was awesome. She communicated with me and told me how much she thought I needed cut off. She listened to me and also gave helpful tips on how to take care of my hair. She is very nice and will do what you ask. I left the salon very happy. I recommend her."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Decided at the last minute, on a Saturday, that I needed a pedicure.  Called and asked what they charged and was told $25.00, which is pretty much the going rate.  I told her I was coming with a friend and was advised whenever I got there, they could take me.  Immediately upon our arrival we were escorted to our massage chairs and had our feet soaking in a warm whirlpool bath.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the pedicure was very enjoyable and satisfactory.  I will definitely go back and looking forward to doing so!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I had initially gave a $60 coupon for a spa pedicure, but I was not impressed.  The woman who did my pedicure seemed annoyed that I was paying for a regular pedicure.  She said it was a regular pedicure.  I was also surprised that they didn't have the option of using the same callous remover as the regular.  I went with the express pedicure and it was great!  I would go back again for a gel manicure"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I went for a simple manicure and pedicure. My nail tech did a great job. I had an appointment and I got right in. The salon was clean and very relaxing. I was greeted by the owner, I believe her name was Kim. She was very friendly and thorough. I will definitely be back!Just had a great pedicure by Ola! She did a great job on my toes and was super sweet. Will be back!This place is great!  I had a great"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This is one of my favorite nail salons in the city. 

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. 

I have had a lot of bad experiences here and this is one of the best salons I have been to. 

They have a lot of color options and it's a very relaxing atmosphere. 

I highly recommend making an appointment. 

This is the only place I will go when I am in town for a weekend or something"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I had an appointment and asked for the same girl. I asked her for a full set and a pedicure. The lady doing my nails said that was not the same color as the color I had picked. She did a horrible job. I asked her to fix it and she said no. I asked for a fill and she did not have the color I picked. I asked for a fill and she did not even do it. The shape was awful. I asked for coffin and she did not get it
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I come to this office regularly. The staff is friendly and professional. The office is clean and the nurse practitioner is very knowledgeable. The office is very clean and the nurse practitioner is very knowledgeable. They are very thorough in their work. The office is very clean and the waiting room is very comfortable. I will continue to come here.I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Lily is the best! She's quick and professional. She makes sure she takes her time and does a great job. I had a bad experience at another salon, and she fixed it. I'm so happy I found her! She's a perfectionist.I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous, but the owner made me feel at ease and was very nice. I had to ask him to cut my hair short because it was so short and curly that it looked"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"If you need or want a tattoo, go to this shop. 

The shop is clean and well-dressed. The guys that work there are friendly and take their time to make sure you are happy. 

I've been going to see some of the artists here and they all do a fantastic job. I'm very particular about my tattoos and they're all very good at what they do. I've seen them on Instagram and they're all very good. They do a great job on"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I saw their Groupon for a blow dry and blow out for $35! I got a full blow dry and blow dry and I am so happy with the results. I was very pleased with the results and will definitely be back.I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was offered a beverage and I had a good experience. I will definitely be back!I went there to get a pedicure. The girl who did my pedicure was very nice and did
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,On Friday feb 10 I decided to go get my nails done and my cousin wanted a pedi first off they had a lady in there running over ppl feet with the vacuum cleaner then she was mopping the floor while ppl were walking around my daughter almost slipped and fell then she rush and did my nails I was so mad because she didn't take her time and she was talking every rude about other customers who didn't want to wait any longer after she told them it would be ten minutes before somebody could help them I will never be back.....
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I paid $350 for a Keratin straightening treatment at J Bangs and I'm not sure it was worth it. My hair is not smooth and glossy. It's just kind of dull with texture, like I tried to straighten it at home and then walked out in the humidity. The stylist also cut my hair dry, leaving lots of blunt, blocky pieces. Including the gratuity, $400 is a lot of money for a service that I am not completely satisfied with. Also, the shampoo guy, who looked like Billy Joe from Green Day with sleeve tattoos, dropped the shampoo bottle on my head."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I will never go back to this salon again!!! I went in for a pedicure and they told me to sit down right away, unknowingly waited a half an hour. I paid an extra $8 for a calus remover that did not work at ALL. I opted not to get my nails painted and was still charged the same price. Actually paid $35 for the worst pedicure EVER!!! I do not even feel like I had a pedicure. I would think if I was a new customer they would have charged a little less for not getting my nails painted. being they charge for a color change."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've had two appointments here now and both have been a stellar experience. 

The office is nice, clean, not too crowded. The front desk staff are always pleasant. 

The favorite thing about this place is how easy it is to get an appointment when I need one. Any time I've call d I've been able to get an appointment the same day, and at a normal time too. 

Any provider I've seen has been awesome- super professional, answered all of my questions, and made me feel at ease. 

I would absolutely recommend this place if you're in the market for a new doctor/gyno."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Gave them a second chance out of Groupon hubris. Mistake. They called to cancel on me, I made other plans for the day, they called back several hours later to un-cancel on me... And because I had made other plans for my time off, like any reasonable person would, I wasn't able to make it to this magical new appointment. So I had to pay a $25 rescheduling fee.

The treatment was...okay... But I wish I had gotten a heads up that I'd be completely naked with a male technician. I need some mental prep work ahead of time to get comfortable with that."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I know there are hundreds of choices in the Nashville metro area for hair cuts, styling, and coloring. However,  there is only one Sarah and she is simply the best!  I have had dozens of haircuts in area salons and shops, but no one has paid more attention to my hair and given me a better cut than Sarah. I have a pronounced cowlick. I have left many other appointments with my hair sticking up and needing to wait days for it to lay down again. Sarah got it right. I left her shop looking and feeling great."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Not importantly to me: IT'S CLEAN!!!!! and inviting and has friendly customer service. They do good work, I will definitely return. My only advice is to probably not go on a Saturday morning or Saturday at all, basically whenever they are super busy because it can feel like you're service is a bit rushed. I would def go when they are slow. Also, bring cash as they have a discount for paying cash instead of card. It also seems like setting an appointment is best because they honor those appointment times. Overall, I will return! Hard to find good nail places in jersey."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I have been tanning for years but never did spray tans. Traci did a custom rapid tan for me and from the initial encounter to the finished tan, it was a great experience. She's so knowledgeable and explained the entire process. She literally perfected my tan and asked questions about the upcoming event I have. I followed instructions and have zero steaks and amazing color. I could not be happier with my experience. Also, she had a mask and gloves on the entire time. The salon is super clean. I am definitely going to be a returning customer and will refer my friends."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"When I met Lindsey, I asked her what she was doing and she told me that I could just style my hair. I am so glad that I did!  She is very knowledgeable and takes the time to learn what she's doing. I have very fine hair and Lindsey does a great job. I highly recommend Lindsey and her studio!I had an excellent experience at this location! My sister had a very bad experience with her hair colorist and a stylist at another salon."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"My 11 year old and I have been going to this salon for years now. I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and the salon is always clean.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have had my hair cut and colored by Jenny. She is amazing. I have very thick, long hair and I have had a lot of different stylists. Jenny has done a great job on my hair and always gives me a great haircut.I recently got my eyebrows"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,We just moved to the area and I was looking for a new salon for my hair.  I came across this salon through the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.  The salon was beautiful and the staff was very friendly.  I had a consultation with Kim and she was great.  She was quick and did a fantastic job.  She did a great job cutting my hair.  I will definitely be returning!Great experience. I came in to get a pedicure and gel manicure.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I had a wedding to go to and needed a haircut. I was able to get an appointment with two of the stylists, both with very different experiences. The first stylist, Lauren, was great. I was very pleased with the service and the stylist was very friendly. I was also impressed with the level of attention and care by the stylist. I was very pleased with the results. The second stylist, Lauren, was very professional and professional."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,This was my second time here and I am very pleased with the results! The salon is clean and modern and the staff is very friendly. I have had a couple of gel manicures and pedicures and this was the first time this has been the most relaxing experience. The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be returning!I had an excellent experience at this location! My sister had a very bad experience with her hair colorist and I couldn't go back to her.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I'm trying out salons as a newbie to the area and this is my go to salon! The owner is super friendly and the salon is beautiful! The salon is clean and very relaxing. I came in with a picture of what I wanted and she delivered exactly what I wanted. I also love that they use a lot of natural products which is great!I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the nail technicians are always happy to answer my questions! I have been going to Angel for years now and
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,My was Massage was good. But it was the worst. I will not be going back.I've been going to the same place for over a year now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and they always look so great. They offer a great deal of specials and I've never had to wait long at all. I'm not sure if I'll
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I don't know where to begin. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the owner is not very friendly. She needs to get her hair cut more often. I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and always get a great experience. I recently started getting a gel manicure.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Nancy, Nancy, Nancy!!!
I hate that I have to go somewhere else for a pedicure!
Also, Nancy is the BEST! I am a very loyal client and have had great service and results with many different services. I am extremely pleased with the service and the quality of the products and services. I have also seen Tracy and Anne and have never had a bad experience!I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Rebecca McMillion has been doing my hair for about 6 years. She is incredible with blonde highlights and layering on both long and short hair seeing as I have had both. I've really appreciated her honesty too since she's talked me out of some horrendous trends that I was considering doing to my hair, like telling me I shouldn't put black underneath my blonde because my overall look is too natural for that :)

I've had facials by Farrah as well, and I always walk out feeling like mush because it's so relaxing. 

Overall everything is clean and well run with a very attentive staff."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I called a day prior and made an appointment for a set time. 20 minutes past my appointment, I still haven't been seen by any nail techs or acknowledged. 

On top of that, one of the employees at the nail salon was not wearing a mask. 

...Appointment setting went like this...
Me: do you have an appointment for tomorrow? 
Them: sure what time do you want to come in? 
Me: my whole day is wide open, what time is best for you? 
Them: noon 

You'd think that if they got to pick the time for the appointment, they'd surely have time for the actual appointment."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I came here with my wife and she's been doing her nails forever and I never partake. She convinced me to do a pedicure and I'm glad she did. My feet are so gross like literally disgusting. This lady didn't care at all she made my feet so beautiful. And she was so soft and meticulous at it her massage and work made me fall asleep best sleep ever. My feet are so nice it's crazy I'm amazed and I feel so relaxed. She clearly had experience doing this and let me know she was a licensed masseuse! Plus everyone was so nice :)
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,Wanted my credit card over the phone even though I had a Gift certificate.  When I refused they became very rude. They told me to leave...so I asked of a refund and they said no we don't refund...then I said well let me see what you type in when I give you may card at that she said no you can't see what I am typing in its company policy.  This is the rudest most unethical business ....very condescending ...Why would they need my credit card?   Then they said if your done you can leave.  BEWARE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I winged it coming here 20 minutes prior to closing.  I was very pleased with the pedicure from Sam.  She was thorough and my toesies look great.  One thing i really liked here was the privacy drapes between the pedicure stations.  Sometimes you just want your peace and quite and not be bothered by others.  The Nailery was very clean and hardly smelled of chemicals.  It was convenient that they track loyalty point on their end, no need to carry another card that i'll lose or forget.  I think i might have found my local nail shop."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've had my hair done here since they opened couple years back. My hair is healthy and perfectly smooth at all times thanks to the keratin treatment I've been getting. And you know that's not easy when living in Florida. The prices are amazing in comparison to any salon downtown St. Pete. All the girls are great, professional and pleasant. Because of my busy schedule I can't get my appointment with only Liset and therefore all the girls have done my hair over the years, never disappointed which is rare. The compliments I get all the time speak volumes for the cut and color."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Don't waste your time.  I recently stopped in just to get a polish change.  I was told it would be 5 min but that was not the case. Every time I asked again how much longer it would be, and saying I could come back at another time, they kept telling me 5 more minutes.  This turned into 30 min of waiting that was only met with a terrible paint job.  My nail technician rushed me and I noticed she only did ONE coat of color, not two.  I can't believe I paid for such terrible service like that."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"So I have been an eyebrow nomad the past year or so when Eyes by India closed downtown. :( that was the saddest thing because that is where I faithfully got my eyebrows done! When I saw that this location was opening... I was pumped!!!

So I have gone several times and I like the quick service! This is located next to the new Meijer on keystone so it's super convenient to stop by when I need to grab something from Meijer!!! 

I always ask for the arch and if I can keep my eyebrows as thick as possible... they always do a great job!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"First things First: laser hair removal is NOT permanent. I wish I would have known this prior to spending thousands of dollars. I ended up finishing treatment but hair regrowth was significant and continues to be years later.

I paid for the package and I do follow up treatments every few months so I'm steadily paying out of pocket. Extremely expensive 

I will say this! The ingrown hairs are gone which was my main concern but the hair is not. Thinner yes but not gone and probably never will be. 

I will also say this, the staff is always nice and friendly! Creve Coeur location."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,I need to add an update to the review below. I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I was seen within 5 minutes. The woman who did my nails did a great job. She took her time and did a great job. I was very pleased with the results. I will definitely be back. I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I was already annoyed because I had the impression that they were all talking about me. I just wanted a pedicure and I got a manicure. I didn't get a full set with gel polish and the nail tech said it was fine. I was charged $45 for the entire set. I will never go back. I'm very disappointed and will never recommend this place to anyone. I will be telling everyone to do it and go elsewhere.I have been going here for years and have never had a bad experience
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I am truly blessed and grateful to have found this place. I have been to the front desk two times and each time, I am greeted by a friendly smile and offered a beverage. The staff is always welcoming and welcoming. The shop is always clean and the waiting area is always clean. The massage is always relaxing and relaxing and the owner is so sweet. I have had great massages and I can't say enough about her! She is very knowledgable and friendly."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Tony and Guy (brothers) are both amazing people. 

I love my hair! I just got a cut and color and I am so happy with the results. I have very fine hair and have had many bad experiences at other salons. I have very thick hair and they have been able to take care of it!

I can't wait to go back!I love this place. It's so clean and the people are so nice. I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"OMG this place is awesome, and the people are very friendly. My first time going in, the girl who did my nails was very nice. I asked her if she could take me as soon as she was done and she did a great job. I will be back!The salon is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and professional. I had a mani pedi and a regular manicure. The pedicure was nice and the massage was great. It's very pricey for what you get but it is"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"My experience is only rated one star because the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I went in for a fill and a pedicure, and the lady who did my nails did a terrible job. She cut me 3 times and when I asked for a refund she was rude and said ""No"". I will never go back.I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found my go-to. I always feel very comfortable here. They have a huge selection of colors"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Horrible customer service. Kept telling me I needed to come back in 30 mins for a fill and to get my nails fixed. I sat there and she said ok, I'll get it done. I told her I would like a fill and she said I don't have time for a fill. I was so mad and I'm furious. She told me to come back in 15 mins and she would fix it. She then told me she couldn't do anything."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I was really happy with my experience at the salon. I got a Brazilian wax and was pretty nervous. The waxer was very gentle and took her time. I'm definitely coming back!The customer service is excellent.  I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails.  They have the most beautiful nail polish selection and they are very clean.  They have a great selection of colors and the atmosphere is nice.  I always feel very comfortable.  I highly recommend this nail salon.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"First time I came here, I had an appointment. I arrived around 5:30pm and was immediately seen.  The front desk girl was very friendly and offered me a drink. The place was clean and quiet.  I was helped by the receptionist who was very friendly.  I was taken to a chair immediately and I was taken to the pedicure station.  I was very pleased with the service and the atmosphere.  The tech did a good job on my pedicure and I enjoyed the massage"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I went in today for a haircut I was told to sign in and I did. I then sat down. There was a few people in front of me who within 10 minutes were getting their haircuts soon after that a few people finished up 
and paid. I waitedand not another word was said to me as for over 30 minutes. I looked and saw two barbers sitting in their chairs doing nothing as I sat and waited.. After a 40 minute total 15-20 of it with barbers not doing anything I left, I guess my money was not good there I won't be back.."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Friendly staff and the owner seems to really care about their customers however, I had to have THREE separate nail technicians today attempt to do an SNS dip powder which ended up looking absolutely terrible when I left. I paid full price for an awful looking set of nails which I told them I was unhappy with. 

I drove straight to CVS to purchase acetone, files, buffer and polish to attempt to repair what they did. 

All in, this was a $70 mistake I could have done at home. 

And I watched the staff dilute an OPI polish bottle while I sat there. C'mon now..."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"While the place is cute, that's about all its giving. If you are young and want trendy nails, like from Pinterest, this place is a no! I wanted my nail tech to do French tips but with a pink color, so simple, and the ended up uneven, and so were my nails in general. Furthermore, they clump nail polish on so your nails look super thick which isn't cute. They are only good for solid color acrylics and even then, those are questionable. The nails they do is not worth the price you pay, and they upped the prices. Save your money, go somewhere else."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Every two to three weeks for nearly a year...the convenience of this neighborhood nail spa just couldn't keep me...though I really tried.  My favorite tech, Lena left mid summer.

Tried to get past the crabby first chair...tried to endure the rushed feeling of a pressured staff...tried to gpast the endless second language banter.  Just not comfortable anymore.

My last pedicure produced small scabs from the rough treatment.  These professionals should be much more sensitive to older patrons thinning skin.  
And the manicure tech acted as though she was doing me a favor by just being there...so rude.  I should have walked out."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"They take your temperature and ask you to wash your hands, which at first I loved and felt so safe but I noticed they don't ask all clients only
People who aren't their regulars. I asked for a full set and she didn't do any cuticle work, i think it's extra to have them do it. Everything is extra here. I wanted my nails to be oval shaped and they said only square shaped is included with the price. I had never paid to have my nail a different shape which I though was odd. The staff doesn't wear gloves! Friendly staff but wouldn't go again."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I hate people touching me. With that being said, my wife made me go in with her and it was surpringly pretty great. The ladies there are really sweet. Been here for more than 5 times already because of how they treated us and how my hands and feet feel after! 
Notice a few people comment about chip paint and I think it's  funny.. if your nail touches water within 24 of painting,  it will chip ladies. I know, my wife complain to me how she can't do dishes after her nails  just a fun fact btw. We will be back soon!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Hannah Goble always takes her time to ensure everything is perfect and the way I want it with my hair!  I cut about 18 inches off and I was extremely nervous, but she assured me I would love it.  I did, and have been going ever since!  She does a FANTASTIC job and everyone always compliments my hair!  I drive about 45 minutes to see her...I don't trust anyone else!  She's fair with her prices and the salon is gorgeous, which offers other services such as spray tan, nails, and a boutique section!  Love it!!  Must see Hannah!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"they took 2 debits out of my account when they weren't suppose to anything. They admitted they made a mistake but refuse to return the money. The office manager, Donna refused to provide documentation saying she fixed the problem,  and Emily  told me that if I have a problem have my bank fix it because they are not doing anything. They cancelled my membership and kept and additional $ 239 in credit that had previously been paid with my membership. Corporate customer service said they can't get involved ONLY the manager (who refuses to help me) can resolve it.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE people."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"This was hands down the worst dip manicure I've ever received. Nails were super bumpy, the color incredibly thick and nail color all over my cuticles (which by the way, weren't TOUCHED). 0 nail prep or cleaning. I try not to tell the nail tech how to do her job, especially the first time I go to a new salon, to let the tech show me her talents, always assuming that they may have their own way to do things. I went home, spent an hour removing her nail job, and redid my nails myself with a better job. I will definitely not be returning."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I have been to Royal Thai Massage Spa many times and it's always a wonderful experience. The owner and employees are all very friendly. The massage is very relaxing and the massages are amazing. I highly recommend Royal Thai Massage for those who are looking for a great massage.I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. They make you feel very welcome and comfortable. I love the color scheme and the staff is so kind and professional. I highly recommend this salon.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I've lived by Peddler's Village for a couple years now and I'm so happy to have found them. I had a fabulous experience at the Spa!

My therapist, Brittany, was very professional and very knowledgeable. I was extremely pleased with the service provided by the staff. I felt like a new woman. I will definitely be returning!I had an excellent experience at this location. My sister had a very bad experience with her hair colorist and a stylist at another salon."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Two of us went. 1Shellac manicure and 1 pedicure. We both were very pleased with the results. The woman who did our pedicure was very friendly and did a great job. The shellac manicure was $40. There are many places to choose from in Santa Barbara and this is the best place to go. I had a horrible experience with a hair stylist. I was charged $150 for a haircut and color. The stylist was super sweet and her customer service was amazing.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Loved my experience here! The owner is so sweet and makes you feel so welcome. She does the best job on nails. The place is clean and the staff is always so nice.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail techs and they all do a fantastic job. I have had a lot of pedicures and they all do a great job! I highly recommend this place.I love this place! I go to Jessica for my nails and she is
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,So. I looked for about a year and a half before I found this place. I was pretty nervous about trying a new place but I was so glad I did. I was very nervous about finding a new salon and I am so glad I did. My stylist was Kim and she was great. She listened to what I wanted and did a great job. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she did a great job! The color was perfect and I love the cut. I highly recommend this place.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Sammi is the best stylist.  She is an expert in color and cut.  She does the best hair color.  The salon is clean and modern.  I'm always in and out with a great cut.  I highly recommend this salon.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. However, when I got there, it was 11:"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I love Sanctity. Josh is a real professional. His prices are very reasonable and he's been doing my hair for over a year now. I also get the TON of great conversation and he takes his time to make sure you're comfortable. He's also very friendly and gives you tips on how to take care of your hair. I highly recommend!I came here for the first time today for a pedicure and gel manicure. The girl doing my pedicure was very sweet and did a great job.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I recently got a cut & color at an expensive shop in Northern Liberties.  After I washed my hair at home I realized that although the color job was good, the haircut was very mediocre. I had a party coming up, so the following weekend, on the spur of the moment, I walked into Hair Cuttery and asked to have the haircut fixed. Brittney did a fabulous job! I've been getting compliments on my hair ever since. The cut cost $18 - about 1/4 of the cost of the original salon I went to. I'll be coming back here for my haircuts in the future."
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"Horrible. The top coat used on my nails was old and bubbled when dry. After pointing it out to the nail tech she made it seem like it was my fault  and claimed she had not had that issue with anyone else all day. She continued to have an attitude while redoing the color only for me to walk out with a mediocre paint job and dried polish all over my hands from the removal. Needless to say, I ended up not allowing her to use their top coat and just finished the job at home. Lesson learned: I should have done my own manicure."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"There are so many people who work here (that weren't doing anything) and yet I waited over an hour to be taken care of. I got acrylics with gel on top and they messed my nails up. They were bumpy and not even at all. I went to another salon recently and they asked me if I even had someone qualified do my nails. They are extremely overpriced as well. If you consider going here, go to Jen. She is the best. I will say that this is one of the cleaner salons I've been to. Other than that, don't waste your time or money here."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I wasn't sure there would be much help for my daughter's hair and I was completely wrong. Crystal is pure magic and a fountain of knowledge  She turned my daughter's home bleached, then lavender dyed hair into the most beautiful sunset of color. I've searched high and low in Tucson for a salon to call home and now we have found it! Crystal was so thorough in our consultation, upheld the integrity of my daughter's hair, and quite literally performed a miracle. Wonderful energy in an adorable setting. We'll definitely be back and won't be going anywhere else. Thank you, Crystal for saving the day!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Easily the best manicure and pedicure I have ever gotten. The first time that I went I just got a mani pedi and was so thrilled about how they looked. The second time I got them done they recommended the ""dip"" because it lasts longer and I am SO SO SO glad I did it. The manicure itself lasted for 4 1/2 weeks and was incredible!!! Helen was my manicurist this time and I LOVED IT just as much. I got them done and she was so detailed and professional. Overall, I will always come to Lux for nail services!!! would recommend to any and all!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Got a great deal through Living Social. $50 for a 50 min. aromatherapy massage. Christine was my masseuse and greetly me politely and even asked if she could start the massage. Overall it was relaxing even with the noisy traffic outside which can be heard through the windows. She did not ask me if I had troubled areas she should focus on. I had a lot of upper back tension and would have enjoyed it more if she paid more attention to the area. I would return if they had specials for a 90 min. massage, I felt 50 mins."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Called and said I would be late for my eyebrow threading appointment as there was unexpected traffic. As I was pulling in, I got a call that they would have to cancel my appointment, which was a bummer, but I understood. However, the person on the phone was so rude to me and was all but yelling at me on the phone demanding I give them a time to reschedule. I asked politely if the person could please be a bit kinder, but I was again demanded to choose a new appointment. I won't be rescheduling and do not recommend this place. Customer service was awful."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Be warned they are always busy. The only reason I've tried to make an appointment is because they do not have the phone. I've also never had to call to make an appointment.The customer service is excellent.  I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails.  They have the most beautiful nail polish selection and they are very clean.  They have a great selection of colors to choose from and they have a ton of color options.  They do a great job on your nails and have
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"After trying to go to a place that does a good job, I found a salon that has good prices and I had a great experience.  The salon itself is nice, clean and nice.  I went in for a pedicure and manicure and was seated immediately.  I had a woman who was also the one who did my pedicure.  She was great.  I went with the deluxe pedicure.  I don't like to go to places where they rush you out of the chair."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I'm new to the area and have been looking for a good nail salon for a while.  I came across this place and I am so glad I did.  I was very impressed by the customer service and the quality of work.  I was greeted with a smile and was seated quickly.  The place was clean and nicely decorated.  The staff was very friendly and I was very impressed with their service.  I was happy to find a new place that I would go back to for my future pedicures. 
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Quick, clean, efficient and flawless. 

I highly recommend this place. If you're looking for a new salon, this is the place. 

I'll be back in a few weeks. 

Thanks for your service!I have been going to this nail salon for years and have never had a bad experience. I have had a lot of pedicures and they are by far the best! I highly recommend it!I recently moved to the area and have been searching for a new salon for a"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"As the name would suggest...I had an appointment with the owner of the salon for a gel manicure. I had an appointment with Melissa, who was very friendly and did a great job. The salon was clean and the staff were very friendly. I would definitely come back to see Melissa!I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. They make you feel very welcome and comfortable. I love my nails and I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,I found Annie's to be a little more convenient than other nail salons in the area. The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff is very friendly. I got a gel manicure and regular pedicure. The pedicure was very relaxing and relaxing. The staff was very nice. They also do waxing which is a very nice touch. I also got a gel manicure and I love the way it turned out. It's very easy to schedule an appointment online.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I had a solid experience here. The woman who did my pedicure did a great job. I had a very nice massage, but the massage was not great. The paint job was sloppy and my nails are in good shape. The pedicure was fine. I would not return. I had a great experience at Salon A. I made an appointment for a color and cut for my daughter. I had a great time. I showed up on time for my appointment and was seated immediately."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"After going to the same salon for the last 10 years I will never go back. I just got a gel manicure and the lady was very rough with my cuticles. She kept pushing it and was sloppy. She cut me 3 times and it was very painful. She also was rough with my cuticles. I will never go back.I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found my go-to. I always feel very comfortable here. They have a huge selection of nail polish."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I'm extremely sad to have to update my past review but it's time this nail salon get their act together. I would come get my gel nails done almost every 3 weeks for the last 2 years or so but after my last visit, I'm done. They are getting cheap by not updating or throwing their nail polishes when they're too old to use and because of that, 2 days after getting my nails done my nails start to chip. I know that they are more than happy to redo them but it's a pain in the you know what. 
Sorry but you lost a loyal customer"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"This place sucks!!! My nails were rushed and came out horribly!!! I have polish all over my cuticles. The polish is clumpy, and my naIls are all uneven and filed wrong!!! I went back to get them done again and was told I would have to pay unless the same person that messed them up the first time does them again!! The asshole at the front desk was super rude and even began to ignore me!!! They will never get my business again!!! Sometimes people forget they are NOTHING without their customers!!!! This place should be boycotted!!! Since they don't care about the people that make them!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This nail spa is an escape from reality. I walked in and immediately felt welcomed and relaxed. The decor is beautiful and the establishment is very clean. The massage chairs are like no other. I was just there for my finger nails, and Tai had me try out the chairs to relax.  The music and scenery on the television put me in such a relaxed state, I never wanted to leave. There are so many colors of SNS to choose from, unlike other spas I've gone to. If you are looking for the best nail spa in South Tampa, look no further...Envy Nails is top notch!!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Fiona at the Union Street location made me a cool blonde.   See before and after picture. 

I called on Monday.  No answer.  Erica the owner called me back immediately and when I told her my usual stylist didn't give me the blonde I wanted, she said ""Sounds like you need a color correction.  Let's get you in a 2pm tomorrow and book you for 3 hours so that you'll have plenty of time""

24 hours later! Voila!  Cool blonde.  Affordable , and the salon is relaxing and I dare you not to fall asleep when Fiona gives you the scalp massage."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"When I need to get my nails done, I always come here, no matter how far out of the way it is.  They have a huge salon, that I'm always able to get in without an appointment.  I don't have a particular person that I go to, but I've never had a bad manicure or pedicure there.  I'm very picky about my nails and am always happy when I walk out!  The lady at the front is super friendly and nice and will make sure you get someone good to do your nails!  It's also very affordable for the job they do!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I'm constantly hopping around from stylist to stylist. My last experience getting my hair done at Salon on Main was with Angelina and Abby and they're phenomenal! 

I also have had my lashes and make up done by Sarah E and WOW! I am impressed by her way to see even the smallest details and she applied my lashes with such precision.

All of girls there are hair artists!!! They all show so much talent and love for what they do. They give great recommendations for the steps to achieve your hair goals in the most healthy way possible for your hair. 


Thank you Salon on Main ladies!!!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,I needed a facial and eyebrow wax with little advance notice. I was so grateful Liza was able to accommodate all appt with such short notice. She is conveniently located in a quiet clean and brightly lit room within Park Place which was walking distance for me. She recommended a facial for my skin and was ready to begin when I arrived which I greatly appreciated that she started on time and completed in a reasonable amount of time both services so I could return to work. My skin feels so refreshed and smooth. I plan to see her on a regular basis it felt so good.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place is a hole on the wall and as everybody knows those are the best! I bought a Groupon for a pedicure and it was great, although I wish the massage part would have lasted a little longer LOL. After I was done with the pedicure she gave me some awesome coupons for a variety of salon services. Needless to say I went there 2 days after to get an underarm waxing and she took such a good care of me and I was as happy as I can be with the waxing she had done. Definitely recommending this place to all my family and friends."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I love love Lather. I've been to the other places in Nashville and they are always the best. The owner is super friendly and the location is perfect. The salon is so clean and relaxing. I have had my hair done at a few other places and it's always been great. The products they use are great! I will be back for sure!I came here for the first time today for my first time with my sister. We were both very happy with the service and the quality of the nails we got.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Great service and super location.
Both of my girlfriends and I went for a couples massage and the massage was fantastic.  The woman who did our massages was very knowledgeable, attentive, and made sure we were comfortable.  She even gave us a tour of the building to check in on.  We felt very comfortable with the massage and will definitely be back!I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the nail technicians are always happy to answer my questions! It's very clean and they do a great job on my nails"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Took my grandmother to Rubs for a manicure and pedicure. The pedicure was great. The polish job was great, but the manicure was not so great. The massage chairs were comfy and the paint job was sloppy. I would not recommend this place.I have been a client at this nail salon for over a year. I have never had a bad experience. Today was my first time getting dip powder and the experience was great! It's very easy to schedule online and the prices are very reasonable."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Anila at Sydney Salon in Tampa. I came to her for a cut and color and she did an amazing job. I've had a few bad haircuts and she took the time to make sure it was perfect. She listened to what I wanted and then made suggestions for the best haircut I've ever had. I highly recommend her and I can't wait to come back!I love this place. It's so clean and the staff is super nice. I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails and I
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I wish I had read some of the reviews before going here. 

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  The salon itself is pretty great.  The color selection is great.  The staff is very friendly.  I got a gel manicure with gel polish.  They also do eyebrows waxing.  I had to wait about 30 minutes but I was seated right away.  

I will be back.This place is great!  I've been going here for about a year"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,Highlights: The ladies were very nice and professional. My stylist did a great job! I got a haircut from Brie and I am very happy with the results. She was very friendly and professional. I will definitely be back!I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was offered a drink and I had a great experience. I will definitely be back!I went there to get a pedicure. The girl who did my pedicure was very rough and rough.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I have had several horrible experiences with the owner and her employees. 

The first time I went, I had a fabulous experience.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  I went in for a pedicure and manicure and was seated immediately.  I had a woman who was also the owner and she was very sweet and did a great job.  I was charged $55 for a pedicure.  I thought that was very reasonable.  I paid $60 for a basic pedicure"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I have been coming to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk. The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly. The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Worst pedicure I have had in a long time, I will not be returning and say take your money elsewhere for a basic pedicure. The facility was clean and staff was friendly however the pedicure I received was so quick and I left there feeling like I needed another one or I could have just done it myself. I typically get a basic pedicure wherever I go and leave feeling I got my money's worth and my toes feeling like new. This basic pedicure was the worst, so rushed they barely let my feet soak, barely groomed my nails, and my feet where still ruff after the pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"wow! they called 20 mins (20 mins) before my scheduled appt to tell me the therapist wouldn't be available. I think that's ridiculous, especially since I drove an hour and a half (and in 5 o'clock traffic to south tampa). who calls 20 mins before an appt? their solution was a male therapist or to come back at 9pm. really? 9pm? this was suggested after I had mentioned it being my birthday and that I had dinner plans. not only do they apparently suck at scheduling, but they don't listen. no doubt if things were the other way around and the customer had to cancel, they'd still charge."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have been going here for years and continue to return. The prices are in line with other nail salons.  It's a little bit dingy, but I have never had a bad experience.  In fact, my nails always look great when I come out of there. Tran is spectacular and really takes care of you if you are her regular customer like me.  She is one of the few nail specialists who really knows how to repair a broken nail. I do go to other salons for manicures occasionally, but if I have a broken nail and want a wrap, I only go to Tran."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Absolutely disgraceful. I was given a recommendation for this salon and I was insanely disappointed. Leanne was extremely rude and made me feel unappreciated and gave me the worst customer service saying I would have to wait more than an hour for an appointment when there was no one in the salon. I decided to wait in my car for the next 30 minutes seeing if there was clients that would show up at the time they were supposed to come in. NO ONE CAME. I will never come here again. If I could give 90 stars I would in an instant. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Its so great to have a high end salon I can walk to. The first thing I noticed at Daniel's station is his 2 licenses for cosmetology and barbering. That means this guy has the skills. 

I had a ten year work anniversary the coming up in which I knew I would be giving a speech to 100+ people, so I needed to look good. 

My hair comes with a receding hair line, balding crown, and about 12 cowlicks, so he had his work cut out for him having never cut my hair before.

He did a great job and I have been getting compliments from strangers even since!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Ask for Jess- she has been great. I was a little (a lot) nervous when I first went. My normal guy at my normal place called off for the second time and I needed a haircut. I used yelp! to see what else was around. The Lions Den had the best reviews so I called and made an appointment and was paired up with Jess. She had Aliens vs. Predators on the TV and she gave a great haircut. This is now my normal place as I have gone back several times. This is a pretty simple business....good haircut, friendly barber and clean place and you've got me."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Great salon, super clean and neat inside. Huge selection of colors and they offer free water and soda during your appointment. I had a spa pedicure which I don't think was worth the $35. Unfortunately, it only included all of the things any regular salon would charge for a regular pedicure. The extra massage was nice and the technician was meticulous with her work which I loved. But the extra charge for callous removing which was just a scrub with a pumice stone was not worth the extra $10. I will definitely come back for a regular pedicure but remember that it will be extremely basic and quick."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I have a long history of back pain, but recently I was in extremely bad back/hip pain for about 2 months thinking I could stretch it out myself. The pain was so severe at one point it was hard to stand or get out of bed and I couldn't shake it.  I finally found Atlas and I'm so glad I made the decision to make an appointment. The Dr was thorough, examined me for various misalignments and adjusted me accordingly. Since then, I am pain free. I've never had such a positive outcome from chiropractic work before. If you are in pain, you gotta go to Atlas!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"This place deserves 0 stars. Wish I would of read all the reviews before I made the horrible decision of going here. Be prepared to buy new supplies every week due to all the stealing. If you deny a client, but you're the teachers favorite you won't get sent home so make sure you're the favorite. You're not tought to work in a salon setting, more like a high school setting. They pick and chose who gets sent home for ""dress code violation"". If you can do hair already you might survive, but if you're coming here to learn because you don't know anything about hair, good luck"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Best nail place I've been to. The owner is super nice and friendly. The salon is clean and the staff is very friendly. The pedicure is amazing, the place is clean and everyone is very friendly. I will definitely be going back.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut. I wanted to be a little more blonde,"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,There is a reason why this place is so good. I will be going back!Very nice. Very clean. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. The massage chairs are great. I would definitely recommend this place. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes late and was taken care of right away.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Stopped in for a quick brow wax and was very pleased with the results! The salon was clean and the staff was very friendly. The waxing was quick and easy. The only thing that I didn't like was that the wax was extremely thick. My eyebrows look like they had been waxed a few months ago. I did get a little wax and it was a little uncomfortable but she did a great job! I highly recommend this place. I've been a client of this salon for about 6 months now.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"NEVER, NEVER, NEVER go to this place again. 

I have been going to this location for a year and a half now, and they're the worst. I was in a bad mood and had to change my mind on a manicure. I was charged $45 for a gel manicure. I was charged $30 for a regular manicure and pedicure. I will never go back there again.I used to go to Mimi's a few years ago. I was very happy with my service, but"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I was hoping this wouldn't be an issue with the spa pedicure, but I was disappointed. I had a fabulous pedicure by the manager, Jenny. She was so sweet and made me feel comfortable. I will definitely be back!I had a wonderful experience at the salon. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder/neck massage. My stylist, Tara, was very friendly and helpful."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I booked this spa for a couples massage with my sister.  We had a reservation and the front desk staff was very accommodating.  We arrived early, and the spa was very clean.  The staff were very friendly, and the massage therapists were very professional.  We had a great experience.  We will definitely be back!I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very unprofessional. I showed her a picture of what I wanted"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Recently came here to see if they had time to do a full set of acrylics and they said yes. I had to wait a while to get the full set done. I was seated with a male technician and he did a horrible job. He filed my nails so far they have chipped. I will never come back here.I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very unprofessional. I showed her a picture of what I wanted
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I couldn't be happier with my look and experience! You get greeted immediately by smiles by the friendly people running the front desk and with water/tea/coffee. The vibe is amazing and everyone is very welcoming! They do great work whether it be hair cutting, coloring or manis and pedis.

If you're looking for gorgeous hair coloring- ask for Victoria! She takes her time to make sure it's the best and walks you through everything that she's doing. She's knowledgeable and patient and I'm so happy with my hair color. 

Overall, I'm super happy with my experience as it was my first time getting my hair colored. I'll definitely be back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Tried this place twice and equally disappointing experiences. It's a very gorgeous and clean salon, but the quality of work was subpar. My gel manicure chipped within the first week on both occasions and I find that they are not as precise with the cuticles, painting, etc. I also find the owner of the salon to be very cold - its a new salon so I would think that the owner would want to be friendly and chat with new clients, but he walked past me several times without even a smile - very unwelcoming. Anyway, I think its a promising establishment, just need to hire more experienced staff."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I got my lashes done last Friday, 11/26. My appointment was originally scheduled for the 27th but something came up, I had to change it last minute. Thankfully they were able to accommodate me on a different date so I was glad. I got Classic  full set with Dana, and I am pleased with the results! It took me 3 hours which was little longer than usual but Dana was still a trainee so I understand. it't been couple days, my lashes look great I got so many compliments. Hope my lashes stay till my next appointment so I can update this review and give you 5 star."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Best nail salon i have been to in tucson!! I went in without calling in and David still put me in his schedule. When i was waiting to be helped he let me sit and wait in the massage chair!!  David made sure i was happy with the size and shape of my nails. He did not rush at all and made sure everything was perfect!! The salon was very clean and had a great calming feel to it. Peaceful music and there was no strong nail salon smell!! Best of all prices are very reasonable!! 

Will for sure come back and recommend this to friends and family"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I have been going to Sherif Zaki's for years and recommend them very highly.  10 out of 10!  They are professional, courteous and always glad to see me.  Their appointment scheduling is responsive and I am always notified via text when I have upcoming appointments.  Sherif cuts my short hair and no one else can do it as well as him - I love the way he cuts my hair and we have always have a nice conversation while he is doing so.  Everyone is friendly, warm and kind as well as very professional ... I will always run to Greenville for my haircuts!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I selected this group, within the insurance plan choices , because of the offering of a patient portal. Two weeks after having had an appointment, I was told ""oh there is a new system so it will be about another week"".  Nothing definite, just an approximate while they work out IT problems. This should have been anticipated prior to implementing a new system as they advertise on their website the convenience of patient portal. 
When I inquired, after a 10 minute hold on the phone, about a biopsy result that is also two weeks past I was told ""it's still pending"". The communication processes are less than satisfactory."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,The employees were nice and patient but the lady filed my nails to the point my fingers would fall off. They didn't know how to work with long nails and had a very difficult time picking out a design. I had to change what I wanted so much because they couldn't do it. So I left with an okay attitude. They were only $38 so I wasn't that mad but next day they chipped which when I knew was going to happen. I've been doing my nails for a very long time and know when someone knows how to do modern coffin nails. She gave me square...not going back.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,My fiance and I stopped in here for a pedicure after work for a couple's massage. We had an appointment and the ladies were very friendly. We got the deluxe pedicure and it was great. The massage was very relaxing. My boyfriend got a gel manicure and he loved it. They also do eyebrows and make up. I would definitely recommend this place.We came here for a couples massage and were very happy. We enjoyed it. The staff was very attentive and did a great job. The massage was very relaxing and
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Got my hair done this weekend. The owner, Nancy, did a great job! I got a haircut from Nancy and it looks great. 

I'll be back in two weeks to see Nancy again. She listened to what I wanted and then made suggestions for the best haircut I've ever had.

I'll be back.I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found my go-to. I always feel very comfortable here. They have a huge selection of colors, but I've never"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,I am here now getting a tattoo and the experience is amazing. The shop is clean and well-dressed. The guys that work there are friendly and take their time to make sure you are happy. I can't wait to come back. Great haircut!  They take their time to do it right. The atmosphere is very relaxed and you feel welcome. I recommend them to anyone looking for a great haircut. I have been going here for years and have never had a bad experience.
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,I could not believe to find a place that could do a full body massage for the same price. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! The staff is so friendly and welcoming. The facility is clean and relaxing. I had the 90 minute combo massage and I was out in 30 minutes. I will definitely be back!I love this place. It's so close to my house and they do a great job. I love the pedicure chairs and the massage chairs.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,My girlfriend and I came here for the first time. I got a Brazilian wax and it was the best wax I've ever had. I also got the Brazilian wax. The staff was so friendly and professional. It was a very relaxing experience. I will be back!The salon was clean and the staff was very friendly. My nails looked great! I had to wait a little bit but I was happy with the results. I am extremely happy with the results.This place is great!  I had a great experience with my first session with Dr
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I've been coming here since it opened and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I get the powder dip powder nails and they always look great. The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly. I have been to many nail salons and this is by far my favorite. The only downside is that they have a huge selection of nail polish. I've never had to wait long but I always get a pedicure and it is always clean. I have been going here for years and have never had a bad experience.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Great service, friendly staff. Tina and her husband are very professional and courteous. I will definitely be coming back. 

Thank you Tina and the crew for a great experience!I had a great experience at this salon.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The salon is clean and well maintained.  I was very pleased with my nails and pedicure.  They offered a great pedicure and manicure for only $35!  I will definitely be back!I had a great experience at this location."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I got a postcard in the mail and the girl at the front desk was very nice and helpful. I had an appointment with Melissa, and she was very sweet and took great care of me. She was thorough and did a great job on my nails. I will be back.I have been a client at this nail salon for over a year. I have never had a bad experience. I always get a gel mani and regular pedi. I have a hard time finding a salon that is friendly, professional and the nail techs are"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I heard about the salon and decided to give it a shot. 

The salon is very cute and clean. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist. She took my name and told me I had to call in for an appointment. I waited for about 5 minutes and then was helped right away. I was seated in a pedicure chair with my feet soaking in warm water. I was a little nervous because I have been to many places in the past, but I felt comfortable"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Never again will I come here. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the one girl who did my nails was nice, but the other lady was not so great.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and my nails have never looked better. I have never had a bad experience. I have been coming here for years now and I have never had a bad experience"
Beauty & Spas,1.5,CG,What the hell! Rudest service ever. The owner is a jerk. She didn't even ask how I wanted my nails shaped. I asked her to get the gel polish off and she kept pushing it off. It's not even a gel manicure. I was charged for two nails that were not even painted. I was the only one in there. I paid $35 for a fill. I paid $25 for a fill. I'm not sure what happened. I will not be coming back to this salon.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I recently moved to the area and I'm so glad I listened to yelp reviewers and scheduled an appointment. The salon is clean and the owner is really nice. First time I called I was scheduled with Jay and I'm really happy I was. For years my previous stylist and I have been working to get the perfect auburn hair color and he bettered it in one go around. Recently went for a second cut and color and it is even better. He was able to make my highlights subtle enough that my color looks natural and everyone thinks I'm a natural redhead. Absolutely recommend the salon and especially Jay!
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Absolutely horrible experience all around.  The office staff is less than friendly or professional, I was miss diagnosed over and over again, until I went elsewhere, I was given the wrong medication that only made my condition worse, to the point I ended up in the ER.  Not to mention I underwent an unnecessary procedure that was excruciating and the NP who performed the procedure forgot to get a culture.  I have never encountered a more incompetent and rude doctors office.  If you want good care please go elsewhere or you may end up in the ER like me!  Spare yourself the pain and aggravation."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Ask for prices up front.  My regular nail tech was unavailable for a week, so I went to a substitute for fills.  She did a ""so-so"" job, but gels are difficult and they only had to last for 10 days.  When I went to check out, I was charged 50% more than usual.  The girl at the checkout said that the tech told her to charge this, ""since they were 'back fills.'""   

Gadabout has nice spas, generally speaking, and this is my first really bad experience with them.  But $65 for a mediocre nail fill is pretty pricey. Surprise charges are really tacky."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I believe the guys name was Alex that did my nails as it was hard to understand him,he did a terrible job,they were falling off one hand and the other hand was perfectly fine so I went back 1 week later  the same guy fixed my nails maybe 2 weeks later all the nails on my hands were falling off he offered to fix one hand that day because he did it for free he glued the part that was grown out so he didn't have to redo my nails.I will NOT be going back there again if you want good nails ask for bebe!! Or go someplace else"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Called to see if they could squeeze me in for an ""emergency wax"" I ended up getting two different waxing services and my hair done! Kick @$$ friendly staff with a serious sense of humor to enhance any kind of day you might be having! Lindsey the wax lady is a GODDESS whom you can trust with the most sensitive of services  and who will also make you comfortable in a not so comfortable situation!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, from your friendly ""last minute/late to everything mom"". 
PSA: TRUST LINDSEY, she will tell you straight up which waxing hurts, and she's extremely quick and accurate! 
Bonus: my hair looks bomb!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"On more than one occasion I've scheduled a couples massage weeks in advance and have gotten cancelled on the day before because ""one of the massage therapists was no longer able to come to work that day/time."" Is it just the norm for massage envy employees to not show up for work or something? If it had only happened once I would consider it a fluke, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Giving 3 stars because the one time I was able to reschedule my massage, it was a pretty good massage - but with the scheduling challenges I will just be taking my business elsewhere moving forward."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Stephanie is awesome! Her biggest perk is not that she's American & speaks perfect English (who doesn't hate having people shout across the room eachother in a language they can't understand?) She's funny, energetic, and really pays attention to detail! Her prices are higher than what you would pay at the random nail salons on State St (not by a huge amount, mind you), but it's totally worth it.

Tips: 
-You need to book in advance, her appointments fill up quick! 
-Parking can be tricky so leave early and try the side streets away from Mission.
-If you want nail art done, let her know in advance and ask for extra time!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,This was my first time ever daring to get my hair dyed and I researched and read about many different salons and stylists before I made my choice. I wanted to be sure I found someone who could do exactly what I wanted. I booked an appointment with Joe and was sooo nervous about how my hair would look once dyed. Well let me tell you... He did NOT disappoint! All the reviews I read about him before were so on point! I LOVED the ombré/balayage look he gave me! I am extremely happy I choose this salon for my first dye and plan on coming here for many more!!!
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I've had all four of my tattoos, my naval piercing, labret piercing and my nose piercing done at Artistic Skin Design. Each time I've been there all of the staff have been extremely nice and beyond personable. Having a sense of humor and not being in a rush to get anywhere are crucial if your going to get a tattoo here; but really if you're choosing to tattoo something  on your skin that's going to be with you for the rest of your life, you really shouldn't be in any kind of rush for the tattoo artist's to hurry up working on your design, but that's just my perspective."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"We very much enjoyed our couples massage at the Sandpearl Spa. It is a bit expensive, but not any more than your typical high end spa. A variety of services and treatments are available, and we had no trouble booking our appointment. The receptionist was friendly and knowledgeable, and both masseuses were professional. The beauty produces available for use after our massages were a nice touch. I also really liked the coed sauna, and we were able to return and use it for the rest of the day. The only downside was that the steam room wasn't working the day we were there. Otherwise, it was a very relaxing experience."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Loved the salon. It's a little hard to find as the sign is not very visible. They were able to accommodate me on a less than 24 hours. I had originally asked for Amy but was told she is mo longer taking new clients. I was the assigned to Kirsten and am very happy to have found her. I showed her a picture of the haircut I wanted and it's exactly what i got.  She showed me how to style it and am actually looking forward to try her easy to follow instructions. I will definitely be coming back and will even try to do some highlights as well.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I  suggest you don't go here if you want a pedicure that is not relaxing and doesn't look good. The people are rude and don't care about you. I will never go here again. It's a shame because they are busy but I will be back.I have been a client at this nail salon for over a year. I have never had a bad experience. I always get a gel mani and regular pedi.

I'm a very picky person and I always leave happy.   The shop is always very clean and the staff is always welcoming.  I have also seen the owner, Nicole, and she is a great stylist.  I would recommend to anyone.  I'm always nervous because I always feel very rushed.   I've also had a few others do my hair,"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Me and my mom were here for the weekend and decided to get a pedicure and manicure.  We had a great time.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  We were greeted right away and were helped right away.  The pedicure was amazing and my nails look amazing.  I will be back!I had an excellent experience at this location! My sister had a very bad experience with her hair colorist and I couldn't go back to her. I showed her a picture of what I wanted, and"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Came here last night. They did a great job. I got a dip manicure and pedicure. The woman did a great job and was very nice. Will definitely be going back. I had an excellent experience at Salon Nails. I had a gel manicure and pedicure. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The woman who did my nails was very nice. I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder/neck massage. I will definitely be back. I've been to this nail salon a couple of times.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Anthony is the ONLY reason I will go back to him for my hair! He's been cutting my hair for over a year now, and I have never had a bad haircut. He's amazing! I have been to many places in the area, but I always come back to him. I have never had a bad cut from him, and I have never had a bad cut from him. He has a great personality, and it is always clean. I always feel very comfortable there, and his work is always on point. I would highly recommend him"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I'm so great full for a blow out. 

I love my hair! I'm always a little nervous about trying new places but since I have never been to a blowout salon, I was nervous. I walked in, was greeted by the receptionist and offered a drink. 

The woman who washed my hair was very friendly and professional. I've had bad experiences with my hair before but I was very happy with my experience. She gave me a blowout that was very relaxing and my hair looks great.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Got my nails done here last week and they look amazing! My nails are beautiful! I got a gel manicure and a pedicure and both have lasted a solid 2 weeks! The place is clean and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely be back!The salon is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and professional. I had a mani pedi and a regular manicure.

I will definitely be going back! I will be back!I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut. I wanted to be a little more blonde, but"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I got my nose pierced by Billy this past Sunday, and going into the shop, I was so scared I thought I was going to die! However, he did a great job explaining the process, showing me the (sanitized!) equipment, and most importantly, going over the after care. He let me go at my own pace, and the entire procedure was incredibly quick and painless; I literally cried ""that's it?!"" when he was done. The entire staff is really nice and welcoming, and there seemed to be a variety of people coming in for different services. I'm really excited to go back at the end of August for my first tattoo!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Ina, Ina, Ina!!! Listen, Ina hands are magic!! She literally transformed my 3 month bushy eyebrows into LOVE!!
This was first visit. I asked for her because of the many google reviews about her service. She is worth every penny and 75% tip! First, she shook my hand and introduced herself. Next, she asked me what I was looking for and what shape I wanted. Then, she went to work. She took her time and perfected my eyebrows. No more evil step-sisters but twin angels who go to church on Tuesdays and Sunday and eat chicken pot pie ( For those who don't understand, I'm talking about the symmetry of my eyebrows!)"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"My boyfriend asked for a couples massage for his birthday.  Being somewhat new to the Indy area, I naturally searched on Yelp for our best options.  Indy Massage Company was one of the first places to pop up.  After reading a few reviews, I had a feeling it would do just fine.  We arrived about 5 minutes early, signed one paper, and were taken back to the room.  After that it all becomes a blur.  The best, most relaxing 60 minutes of a blur.  Both of our massages were excellent.  I highly recommend Indy Massage Company to anyone looking for a wonderful experience!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"If I could leave zero stars I would. Sign says walk ins welcomed. Was ""greeted"" by the owner who asked what I wanted. Had to hold back my laughter and was tempted to say was there for a car wash. Asked for pedicure said it would be about 20 mins. After 30 mins 2 more customers walked in. Then a lady came to me and said I can soak your feet but it's another hour because you don't have an appointment. I live 5 mins from here but WILL drive an hour before I'll come back. Plus they have very old bottles of polish and a very strange unheard of brand."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"As a graduate of SBBTI in 1994, I can say that the education and training I received was excellent. I landed 2 jobs with 2 of the best places to work in Ojai and Santa Barbara at the time, right out of school, and I am sure it was from BTI's good reputation and training.  As a current ""customer"", meaning, I receive massages from students quite often, it is apparent that the school has only gotten better with time. The students always seem to have great attitudes, approaches to clients and strong knowledge base, just as it was so many years ago. The staff are ALWAYS so positive and helpful."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I live in West Chester but spend a lot of time away for work. A trip to Zazen is one of the first things on my agenda when I get home.  I love the Zoya polish, the standard of hygiene at the salon, and everyone on the staff.  I have never had a bad pedi here.  Everyone is cheerful, and never appears grossed out by how beat up my feet are from distance running.  Unlike a lot of other salons, the vibe at Zazen is youthful and energetic.  My pedis last for weeks so the prices are quite reasonable for the quality of service Zazen delivers."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Instead of visiting one of those nail salons, you should really treat yourself and make an appointment with Tea for a manicure.  She is the best in the city not just because she is very efficient and friendly, but because she can make your nails look like works of art.  She can create the coolest nail art on the tips of fingers--just ask her and she can make anything your heart desires--hearts, bunnies, cats, etc...
If you just want a regular manicure, she is great at that too.  She gives the best hand massages.  Tea  can also do the gel polish manicures and they last and last."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I went here to get my double piercing, and it was an amazing experience. I was a walk-in customer, and even though I didn't have an appointment I was helped immediately. The guy who pierced me, Noah (totally recommend him, he was awesome) was helpful and efficient. He helped me pick my jewelry and talked me through the process. He then spent several minutes looking at the marks he made where he was going to pierce to make sure he was satisfied with how they looked. It was very quick and done very well. I am extremely happy the results. If you are looking to get a piercing, definitely come here!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"After moving to the city, I was hoping to find a new salon for my hair.  I came across this salon through the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.  The salon was beautiful and the staff was very friendly.  I had a great experience.  The salon is a bit small but I didn't have to wait long and was taken care of right away.  My stylist was Amy and she was extremely nice and friendly.  I was so pleased with the end result of my hair cut and I will definitely be back."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Brio spa is amazing. I go to the Spa and Spa for all services and have been to every spa. The spa is amazing. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The massages are amazing. I have been to many massage places and this one is the best. I would definitely recommend this spa to anyone!I've been to several locations over the years and have never had a bad experience. I had a very bad experience with the hair stylist and a group of people that went there to get their hair done, so I was really disappointed"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"The entire staff here is friendly and professional. I've been coming here for a couple of years. I always have the best experience. I also get the gel manicure. I go to Lea and she is amazing. I've been coming here for years and she always does a fantastic job. I always get a gel manicure and the last time I went I got a regular manicure. It's been a month and my nails still look great! It's very easy to schedule an appointment online, which is very convenient."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I normally do not take time to write reviews, but I saw a lot of the reviews and decided to give it a try. I was very happy with the results. The staff was very friendly and professional. I will be back.I had an amazing experience here! I had a mani/pedi with Helen and it was by far the best experience I have had! She made me feel comfortable and was very personable! The only reason I gave a 4 out of 5 is because I wanted to tip her well. She was very nice and professional"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I was there for about a month and a half. I saw a lot of people getting pedicures so I had to say something. 

I got a gel manicure and regular pedicure. The lady I had was very nice. I got a gel manicure with gel polish. She was quick and did a good job. However, I noticed that she didn't even do a very good job on the cuticles. It was all a sloppy job.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I hate going to the nail bar, but I decided to try it for my birthday. 

I am very happy I did.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  I received a gel manicure, which is $25 and is still cheaper than most nail places.  I was also impressed with the massage chairs.  They are very clean and the staff is very professional.  I highly recommend this place.  I will definitely be returning for my next manicure!  I hope the nail techs are more experienced and"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Dr. Loyd is very thorough and takes the time to explain what she's doing. She's also very knowledgeable and caring. The office is clean and the staff is friendly. The office is very comfortable and well kept. I would highly recommend this office.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut with a different stylist. The color turned out ok,"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"These guys generally do a good job, but the last two times I've been I've been disappointed. If you're looking for a quick mani/pedi go to this place. It's in a very busy strip mall. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on a Saturday afternoon. I arrived at 11:15am and was seated for my pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Pretty clean place. Friendly staff. Staff is professional. Great prices. My nails always look amazing!I've been going to the same place for over a year now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and they always look so great. They offer a great selection of colors and the atmosphere is nice. I have tried a few places around town and have never been disappointed. The only reason I've come
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I had an appointment here after purchasing a deal from Groupon or buy with me or some such, and it ended up being really great! 
The masseuse asked about the pressure-to which I replied ""the heavier the better"" and she did not fail to accommodate that. 
I am not the hugest fan of oils being used in massage as I feel I ""squick"" all the way home. This was compensated for by the application of warm moist towels to remove the extra, and even afterwards, my skin felt moisturized, so that was great. 
All the massages include a foot scrub, it was incorporated to the massage. 
I would definitely go back again!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I went to get my nose pierced and Stan was great. He has actually pierced my nose more than once. He has more experience than most of the others, is friendly, gentle, and very patient. I would definitely recommend him for ANY of your piercing needs.

And for tattoos, Mark Skipper is your guy. I decided to get a tattoo on the inside of my wrist, and the top of my foot. Can we say painful?!?! Hell yea. Despite me getting a little nauseous the whole experience was great. Mark is patient, hilarious, and definitely knows what he is doing. I get lots of compliments on his work and I am very pleased."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"First trip to this salon since new management and I was a little hesitant to try it, but so glad that I did! This salon is beautiful and very clean. The staff is friendly and I was impressed with the service I received. I was seen by Hannah and she did a gel manicure for me. There were plenty of colors to choose from. I was charged $30 and was able to add tip to my card payment. There were signs all over stating there was a cash discount, but I'm not sure what the exact discount is. I was pleasantly surprised by this salon and would recommend giving it a try!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Will definitely be a regular after my visit here with Kate. She made my first experience with waxing so cool - not awkward or weird at all (first time Brazilian) we actually had a lot in common and our conversation took my mind off the pain. The receptionist who booked my appointment was SO sweet. I went to another place (European Wax Center) who said my hair was too short, when I called to cancel my appt at Waxing The City she told me to stop in just to make sure and she said I was good!! So happy I stopped in and so happy I didn't go to European Wax Center!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"DO NOT GO HERE. The lady doing my nails messed up my gel manicure so badly that another woman had to finish my manicure by filing them half way down and polishing them to look presentable. Manicure was not redone, though, and still looked bad (better but still bad). And when checking out I was charged the full price for the manicure and when I asked if I had to pay the full price since I feel like it was a halfway done manicure the woman just said ""they did their best"" and made me pay full
price. Have absolutely no respect for my time and money. Will not be going back here!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I saw Adam, he was awesome!  I was super excited to get my first ever tattoo for my 50th birthday; but I was also nervous (I think if looks could kill poor Adam would be dead).  I got it on my ribs and was pleasantly surprised that it hurt less then I had anticipated.  The whole time, Adam made sure I was comfortable, checked to make sure I was doing okay and communicated to me what was going to happen.  I love my tattoo, my experience was great, and if I was asked to recommend a great place to get a tattoo, Carmel Ink would be my answer!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Five star! For everytime without fail I get results that are stunning! I modeled for Jacqueline Scordato, Paul Michelle's hairshow, and was completely amazed at the transformation they did to my hair to accent my features. I continue to go back and get my hair done, trusting my stylist in what she envisions for me! It has been an absolute joy, and I really look forward to my visits. Conversations are great! And the mini message, well I really don't have to say much about that. You get your hair rinsed, washed, scalp and neck messaged! Prices are very good for the remarkable service provided! I highly recommend trying Jscordatos Salon out."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"First time here today and I'm impressed so far. Very clean and bright with sterilized and sealed implements and liners for the pedicure tubs so you never have to worry about the previous clients germs. Nice!

I had to offer a little direction on how I like my nails done but Anna quickly made adjustments and did a more than decent job. I tried the spa pedicure, it was ok, probably will stick to the regular one next time. The attention to my nails was really great but the mask, hot stones and paraffin didn't wow me. 

I will definitely be coming back to see if this will be my new spot though."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Hey there my fellow yelpers!!! 

I became very daring one day and decided to inflict some serious pain upon myself! Well I wanted to become hair free down under and based on the wonderful people I yelp, I made an appointment and low and behold, I ended up on a table ready to cry like a baby. However, the pain that I thought was going to be horrible, wasn't so bad after all. Ashton did my waxing and she was very professional in which I was very happy because I was feeling a little weird in the first place! Ok, overall a great place to go for a Brazilian wax! Happy waxing!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Awful service! I made an appointment for 3:30 and was told they close at 3:30. I waited for the nail tech to finish and then the tech told me it was fine that it was. I waited for 30 minutes before they even started my nails. I was very disappointed with the service. I was also disappointed with the massage part. I was told the tech had already left and was going to get a manicure. The tech did not have a good experience and was very slow. I will not be going back.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Tony the masseus was great. He did a great job. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same stylist for many years now and she always does an amazing job. She takes her time and is very precise. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and it's always a pleasure to see her. I have been going to Oggi for several years now and she has given me the best haircuts and color I have ever had. She is professional, friendly, and a perfectionist."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Went in for a full set of acrylic nails and they did a horrible job. I was not impressed. There was a lady doing my nails and she seemed annoyed that I was there. The place was dirty and the nail tech was not very friendly. I was charged $45 for a full set. I will never go back. I would not recommend this place to anyone.I love this place. It's so clean and the staff is super nice. I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails. They have a great selection of
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Absolutely love this nail salon!! They do such an amazing job! My nails always look amazing! They are so sweet and the prices are great. I get the gel manicure and it lasts so long! I highly recommend this place!I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was helped immediately and I was taken right away. I received a gel manicure and a pedicure. I was happy with my experience. I will definitely be back. I've been to this nail salon a couple of times.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I went there two weeks ago to get a pedicure and a gel manicure.  The woman doing my pedicure was very nice and the manicure was great.  The pedicure was great.  I would come back.I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous because I had never had a pedicure before. I read some great reviews about this place and decided to go ahead and try it out. I'm glad I did! My toes look great and I will definitely be back. 
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I went to Salon Charisse for a haircut and blowout for my wedding this weekend. I'm so glad I chose this salon. The salon is very modern and clean. The staff is very friendly and professional. I was very pleased with the end result. I will be back in the future!I had a great experience at Salon A.  I made an appointment for a color and cut for my daughter.  I had a great time.  I showed up on time for my appointment and was seated immediately.  The color and cut were great. 
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I have been coming to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk.  The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly.  

The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language.  I have been going to this nail salon"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Update: My gel mani lasted a week and a half. I will not be going back.I've been going to the same place for over a year now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and they always look so great. They offer a great deal of specials and I've never had to wait long at all. I'm always happy with the results. You can make appointments online and they always
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I just recently started coming here. The owner, Nancy, is very kind and the salon is very clean. I had a great experience. The staff is very friendly. The owner is very helpful and takes her time. I'm a loyal customer.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut. I wanted to be a little more blonde, but unfortunately my hair was"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Before today, I had never had any body waxing done. Mostly because I have very sensitive skin but also because I can be a bit of a wuss. I was immediately impressed by how clean and professional their rooms and work stations are, which was my #1 concern. I had my legs and bikini line done by Tiana, who was fantastic! The pain was far less than I thought it would be, and she kept me engaged and distracted through the whole thing. Not for a moment did I feel nervous about not having pants on in front of a stranger. I'm thrilled with the results and I can't recommend this place enough."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"$300 for a root touch up which only gave my daughter a look that she hasn't touched up her hair in years?! Absolutely horrible place horrible staff. They should not be allowed to do hair anymore and strictly be a nail salon. Because they really ruined and destroyed my daughters hair, after all the hard work she has put into it towards her hair, she went in for simple root touch up and a few low lights. And somehow they managed to fuck up suck a simple task. Even the manager didn't know what he was talking about and kept persisting that it looked good when she confronted them about the orange copper"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Super cheap, but as they say 

""Good haircuts aren't cheap, and cheap haircuts aren't good""

For the price, they do a serviceable job. But the few times I went there I left feeling like I should take an HR training on sexual harassment or something. I jokingly refer to this barber as the ""poon barber"" because it seems like all that is discussed is the discussion of specializing women, that if I really paid attention to it, it would likely fall well within the lines of sexist misogyny. Let's just say that two years ago during the summer Olympics I learned a little too much what they thought about the Brazilian women's volleyball team.."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I just had the best morning at The Nail Spot with Faiza! I got a gel manicure and a pedicure and I'm so happy with my experience! As soon as I walked in, I was warmly welcomed and that continued throughout the whole visit. Faiza is so easy to talk to, it was almost like I was just there to hang out with a friend. But she also did an amazing job with my nails! They're absolutely beautiful! She pays such close attention to detail. The shop was super clean, cute, and comfortable. I will definitely be going back soon. I'm so happy I found a sweet little shop in Nashville!! Thanks Faiza!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Final touch did a great job on my dip nails and pedicure. Their location is convenient (in a shopping center next to Fry's) and prices are reasonable compared to other nail salons I have been to. Note that they take walk ins only, so plan to arrive early to avoid waiting for a spot. We got there around 11am and only waited a few minutes. However by the time it was 1pm, there was an hour long wait on a Friday. They mentioned that they are usually very busy on Fridays. 

Masks were mandatory when we went, so be sure to bring one with you. Also, don't forget to bring cash for tips!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Recently moved from SF and was looking for new place to get my haircut. It's not a salon, so if you require extensive styling I don't know if this is the place for you. The place has a great old school barbershop vibe from the antique crank-operated cash register to the barber's pole out front. I'm a ""regular dude"" and I thought that the hair cut was great! Joe was very professional, I described how I get my haircut back home and he knew exactly what he was doing making the haircut quick, out in 10-15 min. Prices have gone up since last person posted ($19) and parking may be hard to find."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place is fantastic.  I've been coming here for about a year and half and both my hair and I couldn't be happier.  The first time I went, I booked with Mo for a cut and color.  She is awesome.  She listened to everything I had to say and made absolutely sure we were both on the same page before she started.  Both my cut and color were fab., I've gotten so many compliments.  I've gone to Mo several times since that first visit and I've never been disappointed.  Love her & the salon, everyone there is so friendly it's really a great experience all around."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've gotten my haircut from Frances, the owner, for the past 2-3 years and she's great. You can call ahead and get an appointment, sometimes even the day of, without a problem. The prices are a total bargain - shampoo and cut for my shoulder-length hair (women) is $15ish. Frances speaks English (not always the case in Chinatown salons) and you can tell her exactly what you want, but she's also happy to suggest ideas if you're looking to experiment. The place is very efficient, I'm always in-and-out in thirty minutes. I would definitely recommend Perfect Cut and Frances if you're looking for a simple, efficient, budget-friendly place to get a nice haircut."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Friendly staff and the service was quick (slow day). With the use of a very very average flat iron, I received a very very average service. My wash-blow-straighten looked like a job I could done myself. 

I barely felt the flat iron on my head and the heat was low. She had to re-flat iron many parts after she was done. The blow dry was just a blow dry and the stylist asked ME was it dry..? All in all, the service was ok and there was nothing too special about my visit. I was satisfied and with a $5 off coupon, I only paid $28 so not too much to complain about."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot. 

The salon is very cute and clean. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who was very helpful. I was greeted with a smile and asked what I needed. I was offered a drink and I waited for my stylist to start working on my hair. I went with a very short bob and asked for a cut with a curling iron. She was very friendly and helpful. I was immediately offered a drink which was a nice"

Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"First, I called to schedule an appointment and they were able to squeeze me in for a massage and facial appointment within the hour. I arrived at the spa and was greeted by a very friendly receptionist. I sat down in the massage room for about 15 minutes and was taken back to the waiting area. The facial was wonderful and I will definitely be back!I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the nail technicians are always happy to answer my questions! I have been going to Angel for years now and she is the best."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Just in Philly for two years and I am very picky about who cuts my hair.  I have never had a bad cut from him.  The shop is clean, professional and nice.  I have been to many places in the city and this one is by far the best one.  I will continue to come here.I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job. The place is very clean and they have a huge"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"Asked for French tip nails and she kept saying it would take a few more minutes. I said ok. She didn't say anything, just took the polish off and took it off. The color came out okay. She cut me 3 times. I told her to stop. She was also rude. She didn't seem to care. I had to tell her to stop. I asked for a French tip. She seemed to be annoyed by my request. She started to paint my nails and it looked like she had just painted my nails. I asked her to please stop"

I had no issues with the staff, they were very friendly and professional. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!I've been to several locations over the years and this is by far the best. I had a very bad experience with the hair stylist and a few of the stylists there were very nice but I'd never had a bad cut here.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been a client of Kristen's for over 10 years now, I have followed her from Balance, to little Glow, to bigger Glow, to current Glow (which is fabulous). I don't trust anyone else to touch my skin. Because she is so fantastic, Kristen has carte blanche to perform whatever services she feels my skin is in need of or could benefit from at every appointment (monthly), and she has NEVER taken advantage of that to try to sell me a more costly service or product that is not necessary. She has earned my trust and my loyalty. I thank my lucky stars that I found her and my skin thanks her too :)."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Got a pedicure, walked in no problem, the place was empty. I was glad because I was last minute but it should've told me something. The people were not friendly, the nail polish did not look fresh (ANY of them). The pedicure was rushed- cold water, towels with holes, no attention to heels or cuticles other than lotion, massage was zero pressure, and the polish on my big toes LOOKS clumpy. They walked me to the dryer, which, while she switched it ""on"" wasn't lit or warm, so I think it's broken. The lady then came and waved a receipt in my face, without any words, which I thought was rude. Won't go back."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Came here just to get a color change on my nails and old gels removed. They were busy when I first came in but someone was done and available quickly. 

Sophie did my nails and she was lovely. Made some light conversation with me and was super sweet. She also did a great job on my nails. The were buffed and shaped just how I wanted and the gels were well done. 

The space is really clean, things fit tightly in the space but it's very comfortable. The staff is nice and id come back here. I payed 28 for the take off and new color which I thought was a pretty good price."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"An update: an hour after I posted this, my phone rang and it was someone from TAR. I thought that they were calling to let me know what had happened and try to make it right. That way, I could write an update here saying that at least they were trying. BUT, instead, she asked ""Did you just write a review on Yelp?!"" I asked her why she wasn't calling me about the appointment and her response was a very confrontational ""I will but first I want to ask about Yelp"". I gave up then and just told her to forget that I ever had an appointment. Groupon is processing a refund. Classy place."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Went in to get a piece done by the beautiful Allison (owner of White Fox) and was blown away. I got a gorgeous piece and it is truly a work of art. I am already planning my next based off of the one I just got. I couldn't be more ecstatic about this new addition! Her hand is light, her line and detail work is phenomenal. Her other artist and apprentice in there at the time were all kind and it felt like I was hanging out with friends. I felt so safe and taken care of. Again, thank you for my gorgeous crane. I can't wait to drop another bag on you again!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Visited 2/11/16 the place is clean, and posh they use a different type of arylic than most nail salons I was impressed however disappointed when my gel nail polish peeled off a few days after getting my nails done so after spending the most I've spent in years for a refill I have two nails missing polish and that ""special"" acrylic has chipped completely off! $50.00 for what exactly I'm embarrassed that I've been getting my nails professionally done for over a decade and I've never spent $50 for a refill and gel polish and to then walk around with 8 polished nails for two weeks. I will never visit Geneis Nail Salon Again."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Posh tech was busy looking around the salon instead of paying attention to what she was doing. She cut my toe and made me bleed. Hurt like hell! I kept asking for hotter water which was barely luke warm. She got up probably 5 x during my pedicure. One was for a hot towel, thankfully. The polish that was applied the first time was thick and goopy. Had to take it off and start all over again. This is the 2nd time in a row I've had a bad experience there. Thought I'd give it another chance. Now I know not to go back. I felt rushed and that the tech was very unprofessional."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,This is a pretty good nail shop. Best one in the area where there isn't much to choose from. I enjoyed the services and the prices are reasonable. I gave 3 stars because I went in on a Saturday and it was extremely busy and they don't have a sign in or an organized way to keep track of who should be serviced next. This caused some confusion. Also my nail tech was kinda rough and I ended up with a stinging cut in my finger from filing too rough. I know it was an accident so I will likely return. If you go here tell them to be gentle and avoid busy Saturdays.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"The pedicure was fabulous! The woman who did my pedicure did a great job! I will definitely be back! 

I will also say that the customer service is very good. I came in on a Monday and I was helped right away. I got a gel manicure with gel polish.

I will definitely be back!I've been to this nail salon a couple of times."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I can't say enough great things about the quality of their services.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I moved to the Nashville area a year ago and was searching for a new stylist. I came across this salon through the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. The salon was beautiful and the staff was very friendly. I had a great experience. The salon is a bit small but I didn't have to wait long and was taken right away. They offered coffee and tea while I waited for my appointment. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. It's the best manicure I've ever had.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,Completely horrible don't waste your time or money.Went here for a Brazilian wax. I got the BEST Brazilian wax I've ever had.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Lowkey scammed us. Called and asked if they could take us in after we had already made our appointment. They said yes. The front desk girl took us back and told us to come back later. They told us we were not in a rush. I then called to ask if they would be able to take us in. I told them I had to wait 30 minutes for them to take me and my sister. They said yes. We were on our way back to our appointment and they said it would be another 30 minutes. I then walked out of there and

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,This is an awesome place and they did an excellent job in my nails and my pedi. First of all if you come here the moment you enter the place you won't smell the strong chemical odor unlike the other nail salon I'd been too. Their toilet is clean and the place is clean too and very very pleasant athmosphere. I will keep coming back here because of how they took care of their customer and their very excellent attitude. I very highly recommend this place and I found the place where I will do my nails regularly. Thank you staffs of this place for the awesome job and for taking care of my nails.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My friend and I were out here for our birthdays along with several of her friends. We all decided to get tattoos, and found this place after bumping into someone on bourbon street with tattoos from them. It was late so two of the group were able to get in the same night and they made appointments for the remaining 4 the next day. The 4 got tattoos all from Chris and he was super nice. All the staff both nights were pretty cool overall. I showed Chris my idea and asked him to change it up a bit and pick colors. I'm happy with the outcome! Ooh yeah, they have awesome music playing too!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Very clean, friendly and professional environment. I had the pleasure of having Hannah for my stylist to assist me in correcting what I had been cutting for several years. The look I was trying to achieve was very much nailed by her after seeing a few Pinterest photos. They have an excellent array of products, recommendations and styling tips to give. I ended up paying $65 for my haircut, shampoo and styling. Well worth it and honestly very reasonably priced. These are professionals, not your SportsClips or SuperCuts ""stylists"". They are well trained and have to intern there to be selected to work there. If you need updates or professional opinions/styling, look  no further."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"i have been a member since summer 2010. i think this place is okay, but at times they get so busy and there aren't any machines to work it. and then you would have to wait till a machine is valid; the worst time to go is after 4o'clock. i love the zumba there ; but i think they should have more classes. they only have classes in the afternoon on weekdays ; i dont have the time to go there in the afternoon. they should really have zumba classes later at night. its dumb how you can't cancel your membership & how long it lasts for. :/ they should have something shorter & cheaper."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I split my life between my apartment in Center City, and my boyfriend's apartment in South Philly. 

When I'm in Center City, CocoBlue is the go-to. When I'm in South Philly, it's definitely Vivi.

The quality of the job at Vivi is the differentiator here from the other spots that exist along Passyunk. Vivi's not crazy cheap, they don't offer free wine or drinks, but they can give you a regular (meaning non-gel-or-S&S) mani or pedi that lasts for a good long time.

The girls are all friendly, thorough, and focused on detail. You can really tell as your nails begin growing out: they were thinking weeks ahead. 

No bells and whistles, but a really solid spot."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"The people that work in this nail salon is extra rude, and also when we arrived it was 5 then we sat there for a good hour and they finally did our pedicure then told us that they can't do our nails because it's about to be closing time  I'm sorry maybe if you didn't sit us down for an hour that wouldn't of had happened.( mind you there was only 3 people in there)Then when she started on my nails she jerked my fingers and rushed  I also ended up with a cut on my finger after that  so great! Thanks  never going back again, unless they change their act!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,My appointment was at 9:30 I was just going to get my bangs cut but decided to change the color of my hair.  I  showed them a picture of the color I wanted strawberry blonde.  I cant blame the student but the teacher because she mixed the solution.  Lets say I walked out of there with orange hair at 2:00.  The instructor tried fixing the color by putting a solution to reduce the color and washing it but it still is orange.  I spent 48.00 and i got what I paid for.  I am going to have to go to a professional Salon and get my hair fixed.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I've been getting my nails done basically on a continual basis for over 20 years. This place is one of the best I've ever been to and more recently I find myself regretting when I go elsewhere. I was a regular at another salon that had changed ownership AND I moved to the Collegeville area. I've gotten consistently great acrylic / gel nails and pedicures since they've opened their doors. They work hard to give you what you want ( only once I went and and the nails were too thick)I explained the next time I went what I wanted and they executed them perfectly. They never rush and I'm always satisfied when I leave.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I saw Glayci for my first visit to Brazilian Wax Studio. It was the best Brazilian wax I've ever received! To start off the visit, the studio is beautiful and the receptionist is so welcoming. There are couches to wait at and drinks available. Both the reception/waiting area and the studio rooms are clean. They take you to the room and give you time to undress or get comfortable. Glayci was prompt, friendly and so quick! The wax they use is strip-less, but they also have strips for cleanup. Lastly, the prices are incredible! I feel duped for overpaying for years of subpar service at other studios.

All in all, HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Will definitely be back."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I've been to a hand full of nail salons around Nashville and this is the most consistently great. They never rush me to choose a polish. They make sure they're clear about what I want. They show how the colors will look before proceeding. Before, I've felt pressured to go with it even if it wasn't what I wanted. I even once has them remove the polish because it wasn't exactly what I wanted and were super kind and patient with me as I chose something different. Jenny and Helen (?) both have done fantastic. Two of my girlfriends have started coming here as well and we are all very satisfied. 

Definitely a hidden gem."

She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language.  I have been going to this nail salon for over a"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I went to Essentials for a consultation and the staff was very friendly. My hair was very long and wavy.  The front desk girl was very helpful and explained everything to me and made sure I was comfortable.  The salon itself was clean and organized and everyone was very friendly.  I was very pleased with the results and will be returning!I had an excellent experience at this location! My sister had a very bad experience with her hair colorist and I couldn't go back to her. I showed her a picture of what I wanted, and she was able to"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I went on a Sunday afternoon and the woman who did my pedicure did a great job. I had a very nice experience, but the pedicure was not great. The massage was very good and the nail polish on my toes is uneven. I will not be returning. I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. They make you feel very welcome and comfortable. I love my nails and I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails. I will definitely be back."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Just had my first Laser Tattoo Removal session that I bought in Groupon.  As many people have mentioned before, scheduling your first appointment is tough.  You call and leave a message and hope someone calls you back.  My first session did get rescheduled but they did call me 24hours in advance and got me rescheduled very quickly.  My first session was with Yesenia.  She was very thorough in explaining the process and what to expect pain wise.  Was way more painful than I had originally expected.  However,  24hours later and I'm already seeing a major difference in my tattoo!  Very excited to go back for another session."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Not a quality massage at all. Have yet to find a Hand & Stone that gives a great one. It's a large chain so Idk how they hire these people but this last guy didn't seem trained at all. A message does not pull or pinch skin &the oil should be generously applied to the masseuse's hand to avoid pulling at the skin.  A lot of ""poking"" not even kneading. Not relaxing at all. Left feeling like I needed a massage! Lol. I've had better stress relieving massages sitting in the nail salon. 
2 Stars for cleanliness , politeness & price. All of the previous reviews are true: You get what you pay for !!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Place was empty when I arrived. Nail technician was busy with her phone. When I asked what nail color is in fashion, she reluctantly responded that everyone is different, when I asked what's the most popular one, she again reluctantly responded still staring at her phone. Started pedicure, I complained about water temperature, she gave me a look close to rolling her eyes. No legs or hands massage. Uneven manicure and pedicure, very poor quality and cheap looking job, people will think a kid did it to me. When I complained to the owner, he pretended he has no idea what I'm talking about. Do not go to this place, don't waste your money and time."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Really enjoyed my combination back and foot massage. I like the fact you can choose what level pressure you want from them. I choose 2 for intensity but you can go as high as 7. The place is clean and there are lots of attendees available to help you.  They also have a chart that helps you communicate to the masseurs about your needs that are in the white baskets you put your keys/ glasses in. Sure, you may hear some outside noise but you are on State Street which is busy with people. Don't let that bother you as you get your massage. The prices are reasonable and I'll be coming back there again!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I found this place via Groupon and it was a combo package that came with a massage. When I first went it was not what I expected. It was a small office with a small outdoor waiting area with one bench. The receptionist was nice and explained everything well. The wait times where really good as they had people in and out fast. I was impressed. When I tell you idk what magic Dr Jeremy did, but after my adjustment, my headaches went away and all my back pains subsided! I scheduled a follow up visit and I'm so happy I found this place because it was what I needed. Prices are not bad as well."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I was welcomed by Eve (who took my temperature and offered me a selection of beverages).  I was a little early for my appointment, but Keith was ahead of schedule and got me in the chair prior to my appointment time.  I gave him free rein on what to do with my hair and he gave me a layered bob that looks amazing!  I've been walking around touching my hair for the last 24 hours!  Also working were Chris and Brian and they were incredibly friendly and welcoming as well.  The waiting area decor is beautiful; the bathroom was sparkling; the whole experience was great!  FIVE STARS and then some!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Had a Groupon for a hair cut here. It's sort of tucked away in a building by the legislature. Nice clean place. Had no problem scheduling an appointment for a time that worked for me (a previous reviewer said they hardly ever answer the phone here but I didn't have any trouble with that). Paige gave me my hair cut and was really nice and did a great job! I got tons of compliments after. I give the place a 4/5 just because it didn't completely blow my mind how awesome it (My visit in general) was but it was still nice! Great price with the Groupon! Definitely worth it and I would recommend this place!
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I took a gamble and won! I was down in New Orleans for a wedding and didn't have time to get my mani and pedi but I am so happy that I ran out of time. I found this place through google and the pics on google let me know I was making the right decision. The place is so clean and they played really good music. My nail tech was Van and she was every bit of amazing, so much so, if I could take a flight every two weeks to New Orleans I would. Thank you so much for the excellent customer service and I keep getting compliments on how nice my nails look."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I had a great experience here. The owner, Nancy, did a great job on my pedicure and manicure. I will definitely be back!I have been a customer for years. They are friendly and efficient. I am always pleased with my service. I always get the gel mani. I have never had to wait long and have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my appointment. They have a lot of colors to choose from and a good selection of regular polish. All of the nail techs are great. I love that they have a parking lot in"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I lived for 37 years and have been to many nail salons around the country. I have never had an issue. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. I go to Le's and they are amazing. I am always pleased with my nails and I always leave happy with the results. I have also gotten my nails done by Kim and she is amazing! I highly recommend her.This place is awesome!  I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure and they were able to squeeze me in.  I loved my nail technician, she was so"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I just went to Cured Nails and Spa on a whim after reading the reviews. I'm so glad I did. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was so relaxed. The massage chairs were awesome and the massage was amazing. The pedicure was relaxing and the massage was also great. I will definitely be going back.I had a horrible experience with a Groupon. I called to make an appointment and they were able to get me in with a same day appointment. The woman who answered the phone was very sweet and friendly. I'm not sure what she was
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I've always enjoyed this salon, especially when I come here. I always leave happy and satisfied! 

I have had a lot of compliments on my hair and the owner is very friendly and helpful. I have been to many salons and have been disappointed with my hair. The salon is always clean and the staff is friendly and professional. 

I would definitely recommend this salon. I always get a cut and color from Mary and she is the best.This place is great!  I've been going here for about a year now, and I won't go"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This pedicure was HEAVENLY. Hot towels, hot stones, and paraffin dip for the massage. The owner was super nice and I will definitely be back!I have been a loyal customer of this salon for over a year. I am extremely pleased with the service and the quality of the services. They are always very friendly and professional. I had a gel manicure done and it was perfect! My nails look amazing and I can't wait to go back!I have been here twice now and have had both my eyebrows waxed."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Stopped into this place for a pedicure and a gel manicure. The salon was pretty empty so I assumed the wait would be a bit long. I was greeted by a woman who seemed to be in the middle of doing my pedicure. I was seated in a chair with no water. I was offered a beverage and a glass of wine. I was seated right away. I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder massage. The tech did a good job on my pedicure but I don't think I'll be going back.I was a little nervous
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I went in to Rochelle and she did an amazing job! She was kind, patient and just a lovely person. 

She was also very knowledgeable and explained the process as she was taking care of me. She even gave me tips on how to take care of my skin. I felt like a new woman. I will definitely be going back and recommending to friends!I love this place. It's so clean and the staff is super nice. I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails and I've been to other nail salons before."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,This is my favorite Nail Salon in the area!  I have been going to the same girl every couple of years for about a year now and she does a great job.  The salon is very clean and the girls are very friendly.  I have had my nails done by several different people and they all have done a great job.  I have had pedicures and manicures and my nails have never been bad.  They have a great selection of colors and have great customer service.  I highly recommend going to Nail Art & Spa for your nails!I
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"2.5 stars. I'm not sure what happened to the nice people who work here! Usually I can come in, get greeted with a time on how long to wait for service - you know the usual. Today I came in, was looked up and down, a lady asked what I wanted and then walked away and never came back. 

I sat in the waiting area for 7 minutes when finally one of the nice gentleman there said 'can you wait 10 minutes?' I said yes...only because I typically get great service and my nails always look their best here. Not sure what's going on but I hope it fixes itself quick or I will definitely not return."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I did not give five stars only because I was not comfortable with the seating for pedicure. It is different in that you walk up steps and sit on a padded bench that this up the wall. I don't know how else to explain that. I did like that the foot soak was in a sink instead of the jet baths which never feel clean. To get the pedi you have to hang foot over the counter edge which was not comfortable. The tech was very professional and did an excellent pedicure. I just was not comfortable sitting and climbing down. It is a very nice and clean place and everyone working there is professional and friendly.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"After a car accident, I had no option that to seek help with female grooming.
I was quite pleases with the service & attention to detail provide.
This was basically a new experience for me,  but the quickly made me feel relaxed & they took care of my personal business. Gotta say this really spoiled me, I haven't had to shave my legs in 6 weeks, instead of every other day... love it.
It was a good experience, with qualified, friendly professionals painlessly taking care of business. Yes, I would recommend it & return, when the occasion arrises.
What's a girl to do? Female body & facial hair is serious business, I am glad they appreciate & understand this fact."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I did a walk in...its a cozy place...folks are nice and professional...I got a full set and a mani...the owner Christie did my nails..she appeared to know what the heck she was doing and made good recommendations on how to have my nails done...very detail oriented and friendly. and gives a wonderful hand massage..the girl doing my feet..did a great job...used hot stones too!...ahhh...and you get your parking validated (manayunk can be crazy for parking)....I also got the ""shelac"" which is some gel to protect your nail color and be a brilliant shine....i met my hubby at zesties down the street afterwards for dinner and drinks...he loved my nails too....I think ive found my new nail spot."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Terrible! I had taken my best friend for her first pedicure here unfortunately. it was the worst. The workers there  try to pressure you to buy anything and everything. She was scared and self conscious about her one toe I said they don't care, was I wrong the entire time they were working on our feet they were speaking in their native language and looking at her foot  made her feel like crap. I wish I would've taken her anywhere else. Top it off with  ridiculous prices!  for a simple pedicure I payed 35$ for a pedi and got  a $10 job if that."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Always able to see you without an appointment, and the best pedicure I have gotten. My nails were good, but not the best I've had, but I think that's really only because they are SO busy, sometimes a little bit of attention gets missed. However, everyone is friendly, the pricing is fair for the area, and you really do get good service. 

If you go with a friend, they make a real effort to make sure you're able to sit together, and I was even wished a happy birthday when I went last time, which was a nice surprise. I'm glad it's around the corner from my house, because I wouldn't want to go anywhere else anymore."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I love Lakshmi! Amy is the best hair stylist I have ever had. I have curly hair which can be a challenge for stylists. My hair is also very dark so my options for coloring without damaging my curls are limited. Amy was very strategic in making sure my hair stayed healthy and I still got the color change I wanted. She also makes sure that my curls are as healthy and bouncy as they can be. My hair looks amazing for weeks after I see Amy. I've since moved out of Philly and can't get myself to go to another salon. I will make a special trip into Philly just to have Amy work her magic.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was referred to Greco Rose Beauty for an upcoming event in early August 2018.  I sent an email to their info@ email address in mid-June and received a response from them 4 days later confirming they are available and would love to be a part of the event team.  I thought, ""Great!""

I followed up with them in July a few times to confirm and discuss details but have never heard back.  I also left voicemail messages on the only phone number I have for Greco Rose Beauty -- listed in their email signature.  No response.

I am now frantically trying to find new make-up artists for an event next weekend. Really disappointing experience."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I've been getting my lashes done here for years and they've always been great. I go every 2 weeks and have had a great experience. The staff is very friendly and always professional. The place is clean and the girls are very sweet. I have had several different girls do my lashes and they all do a great job! I also love the fact that they are a little pricier than other places but I can't complain about it!I recently moved to the area and have been searching for a new salon for a good nail salon. I am so glad I found this place.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Servies are hit or miss. 

I'd say I will return for a massage but the prices aren't too bad. I'd recommend going somewhere else if you're in the area.The customer service is excellent.  I've been coming here for years and I always leave happy with my nails.  They have the most beautiful nail polish selection and they are very clean.  They offer a variety of nail colors to choose from and they have a lot of color options.  They do a great job on your nails and have a wide range of nail polish colors. "
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,I came here yesterday to get a dip manicure. I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I was seated within 5 minutes. The place is very clean and everyone was very friendly. I got a gel manicure. My nails look great. The staff was very nice. I was offered a beverage and I had a good experience. I will definitely be back!I went there to get a pedicure. The girl who did my pedicure was very rough and rough. I was so upset. I told her I was going to just get a
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Not impressed. Small and dirty. Staff is rude. Not friendly. My nails are not the same length.I had an excellent experience here. I got the basic manicure and it was amazing. I came in with a picture of what I wanted and the technician was very thorough. The salon is clean and well decorated. I will definitely be back.I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found my go-to. I always feel very comfortable here. They have a huge selection of nail polish. I've never had any issues with the service"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"After reading other reviews, I decided to give this place a shot. The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. The salon itself is very nice and relaxing. The staff is very nice and I am very pleased with my service. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a new salon. I will definitely be back!I love this place. It's so close to my house and they do a great job. I love the pedicures and the manicures. The staff is very nice and welcoming."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Samantha D is a fantastic esthetician. She is knowledgeable about her field and the whole team. I always feel comfortable and relaxed during my appointments. The atmosphere is so relaxed and relaxing. I highly recommend her. She is a true professional. I would recommend her to everyone.I have been a client at this nail salon for over a year. I have never had a bad experience. Today was my first time getting dip powder and the experience was great! It's very easy to schedule online and the prices are very reasonable. The staff are very professional and you can tell they
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"A popular stop on a weekend. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the massage therapists are so nice. The front desk person is very nice and welcoming. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the massage therapist was very nice. I don't know how this place gets a 5 star rating. I did get a 60 minute deep tissue massage and it was great. I just went with the hour and a half and they did a great job. I got a deep tissue massage and it was just the right amount of pressure, which I liked."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I usually like this place. However when I visited today I experienced awful customer service. The woman didn't even say hello, didn't get off the phone, or even acknowledge me. Eventually she told me to sit in the chair. She didn't sanitize her hands and continued to talk on the phone throughout the service. At the end I gave her a gift card that I had bought on a deal at brow art. I paid $20 for the card. After I had signed my receipt or $12 and left she chased after me to tell me I owed $4. This made no sense. I decided to just pay the $4 and not deal with this place ever again."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"They did a fantastic job on my pedicure. 3 weeks later and they still look like I just got them done! They tried to make conversation for the duration of the time so at least it wasn't awkward and they had a large TV to watch things on so I would come back again.

What I wasn't entirely fond of how the girl who did my pedicure kept pushing me to do a manicure and kept asking me ""why?"" when I mentioned that I didn't want to do one that day. As an Asian-American with Asian family, I wasn't particularly upset or surprised but I can see how others might be more irked. 

Otherwise, great price and great service!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Very poor experience and one of the worst manicures I have had. The technician hardly trimmed my cuticles and trust me they needed it as its been weeks since I've had a manicure due to COVID. Then she filed my nails and each is an inconsistent shape and length, and didnt even rinse off the dust from filing before she started the polish. Hands down though the polish is what is the most unacceptable- its on my cuticles and skin, on some nails its not covering the entire nail,  it doesnt go to the cuticle, there are bumps, etc., etc. honestly its unacceptable. Not sure if I caught them on a bad day, but very poor work."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Buyer beware!! I have a Botox subscription with them and they are now trying to rob me of 170 units that I've already paid for.  My subscription has been a headache throughout because their computer system could never keep track of how many units I'd accumulated.  I pay a monthly fee for 20 units to apply to my customer profile.  Seems simple, right?  Then, I try to cancel the membership because I'm tired of the hassle of them not keeping good records and they tell me they won't honor the 170units I have in my account.  That's about $1500.  I agree with Julie C. and will be filing a police report too."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"This review is for Teresa. I'll say it once, I'll say it twice and I'll say it a third time  for good measure.... Teresa-Teresa-Teresa. I am a stickler for shape... I usually stick with almond/stiletto cuz they are easier to get right. But I love coffin cut.... no one has ever gotten coffin cut right on me.... except Teresa. When she does it, they are perfect, nice straight sharp flat tips with perfectly sloped sides. I often like really fancy designs, but she does such a great job with the shape that I like to do a soft muted tone to show off the shape. She is the bomb... also, nice smooth grow out. She is solid."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I stopped in a few weeks ago for a consultation to go from very light blonde to brunette. 
I spoke with Lindsey who was very knowledgeable and walked me through the process. 
Today I went and I'm beyond thrilled with the result.  Lindsey isn't just a stylist. She's a chemist. She knew about every step and why she was doing it. She explained it all to me as this was a huge change. She gave me a lot of info and feedback about care, maintenance, and how to repair some hair damage I had. 
I can't say enough how thrilled I am to have done this & I highly recommend this salon and Lindsey as a colorist/stylist."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I travel from Uptown, where hair salons and beauty bars abound, to Metairie for all of my hair services at Glow. It's that good.

Although I have witnessed the other stylist's phenomenal work during each of my visits, I will always snag appointments with my girl Ariel. She's awesome! There is never a time when I am worried or hesitant with my hair in her hands - even when I'm trying a new style or making the leap of ""cutting it all off"". She always makes sure my cut is skillfully crafted and flattering. My color is bomb-diggity each and every time too. 

If you're looking for hair, makeup, or waxing services, make this your first and last stop!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,My sister and I LOVE this place!  We've been coming here for a couple of years now and we have had a lot of great experiences.  The pedicure is amazing and it's a little pricey but it's totally worth it.  I always get compliments on my nails and my nails always look great!  I highly recommend this place!  I've also seen a couple of different people get their nails done here and they all do an amazing job!  The salon is very clean and they have the new nail polish colors to choose from!  They are always very friendly
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Amy's is a very nice, clean, and relaxing spa. The massage therapists are very knowledgeable and knowledgable. The relaxation room is a great touch and the therapists are very personable. I would highly recommend them if you are looking for a new place to get a massage or facial!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great massage. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing, professional, quality massage!I had a great experience at this location. I got a Brazilian wax with Roxanne."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,I walked in here to get a basic manicure. I was told that my nail tech would be running late. The technician then said that she would be running late. I was so upset. I told her that I was not going to be late and that I would have to wait. I waited 15 minutes to be taken back. I was then told that they had already made an appointment for me to be taken care of. I was told that I would have to wait for 30 minutes. I was told that I would be taken care of.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,First this place is very nice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the massage was a little too painful. I will say that the massage was okay. The masseuse was very nice and friendly. I would like to note that the receptionist seemed to be very rough with the receptionist. I was the only one in the room and she barely touched my neck. I didn't get a massage and I was pretty sure she didn't like that. I got a massage for $50 which is a little steep but I felt like she was rushing through the massage.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Only been here once. Didn't know what I wanted and they did a great job. I was pretty nervous about my nails but they did a great job and the gel polish was great.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail techs and they all do a fantastic job. I have had a lot of pedicures and they all do a great job. I highly recommend this place.I love this place! I go to Jessica for my nails and she is the best. I've never been disappointed with my nails! She
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I have to admit when I say I am very picky about my hair, I have never been so pleased with the service I receive at this salon. I have had great experiences with different stylists and they are all very professional, friendly and welcoming. I always receive compliments on my hair and I always feel like I am in good hands. I have had several different stylists and I have never had a bad experience. I am extremely happy with the results and I would recommend this salon to anyone!I've been going to this nail salon for years and it's never been a bad experience"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"About 5 years ago, I had an appointment with the same stylist. When I got there, the other stylist had a seat, and the other stylist was not available. I was told to wait in the chair, which was fine. I then was told to sit in the chair and wait. I was told to wait in the chair, and then I was told to sit in a chair. I waited for about 5 minutes, and then I sat down. I sat down, and waited for another 5 minutes, and then I finally got my hair washed, cut, and styled"
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"Called to ask what time they close, very rude person on the phone answered. Walked in to get a quick gel manicure, was greeted with ""what do you want,"" and I responded nicely. The owner, who I'm guessing is Sunny, didn't even look at me and was rude the entire time. I got up and left after seeing she and one other tech were the only ones working and a gel was $25---that's how much I pay in the suburbs at a clean, friendly and professional salon! 

I would assume she will go out of business soon because of her lack of customer service skills. Very rude, I hope they see these reviews and plans re-evaluate her business structure."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"From the time I made my appt and received my email on prep directions, to the moment I walked out the door, I could tell the girls cared about what my tan looked like. I have had spray tans before, but never this detailed. This was a special occasion with professional pictures, and my ""healthy glow"" looked like I had already been on my honeymoon. The girl who sprayed me sat down with me and discussed in detail what I was was looking for, what color I would be wearing, as well as her recommendation for my skin tone. I felt very comfortable from beginning to end. I was so happy with the outcome, and pictures turned out great!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Great Barbershop! Justin was great and offered little suggestions on my haircut and beard. He was very helpful with my son and what he wanted. I would drive from my home to get the A+ treatment from Men's Club Barbershop. The Men's Club Barbershop is hands down the best barbershop I have been to. My son and I left more than happy with our haircuts. Justin was easy going and and very personable. Check out the website and make an appointment - you won't be sorry. I would suggest you go in with an idea of what you want as it helps. You can also check out the many photos of excellent cuts! Thanks Justin.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,These ladies were so kind and took their time to ensure a flawless pedicure and manicure for me and my daughter. Even after we came in 15 minutes before they closed they still took the full hour to complete our mani-pedis. We got a top notch manicure and pedicure at an unbeatable price!  I am so glad that I took the time to read reviews and search for the best prices while on our vacation.  This was our first time to North Reddington Beach and could have walked in to any of the corner nail salons but I  am glad that we took the 10 minute drive to this friendly little shop! Definitely recommend to anyone!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Not impressed with this place at all. Very, very slow - expect to be here for hours. And the quality was sub-par at best. It took an hour & a half for then to get me started once I was sat down, then I ended up sitting in front of three separate techs before they found one who knew how to do an ombre dip. My nails had to be re-ground with the dremel each time because of issues. The dip that I ended up with was still not what I wanted and was ridiculously thick & sloppy with heavy gel buildup around & under my nails that I had to clean out once I got home. Very disappointing."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"My partner wanted to get back I to yoga and I must admit, I was skeptical. My training is western medicine and I'm not always one to run in the opposite direction. The owner Mia has taken great care of us. Having been in several serious traumatic accidents, my back looks like a jigsaw puzzle. Mia put me with Michelle and let me tell you...Michelle is amazing, caring, and passionate about he love for yoga. It's Michelle that has taken extra time during class to help this new guy out. If you are new to yoga, take Michelle. If you want an advance class, sign up for Mia! Great experience and exceptional staff! Can't wait to try other classes!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I purchased a Groupon for a one-hour facial, and got a 35 minute one instead.  I thought seemed really quick, and it was only after the girl left the room and I got dressed that I realized only 45 minutes had passed since my appointment time. We had spent 5 minutes talking before it started and I also had time to use the restroom and undress.  I called them the next day to confirm that the Groupon was for 60 minutes and was told that I would get a call back after she consulted with the spa manager.  That was 2 weeks ago.  Very disappointed.  To be honest, the facial wasn't that great anyway."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Stopped in to get an appointment with the owner, Nancy.  She was very sweet and accommodating.  She was very accommodating and explained everything to me as she worked on my hair.  She was extremely personable and listened to what I wanted.  I will be back.  I highly recommend this place!I've been to several locations over the years and this is by far the best.

I am not sure if the manager has a problem with her but it's a little difficult to understand how a business can treat customers.I've been coming here for about a year now and I can honestly say I never have a bad experience. I've had a couple different people do my nails and they all do a great job! It's very clean, they do a great job, and the prices are very reasonable.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I have been to this location a couple times and have never had a problem. I have been to other locations in the area and have had good experiences. I have had great massages but this one was the worst. The massage was very rushed. My boyfriend got a deep tissue massage with no pressure. He was also disappointed. He was getting a deep tissue massage and was really disappointed. I was charged $70 for a deep tissue massage.I love this salon! I have been coming here for years now and I have never had a bad experience. I have gotten dip powder and a pedic
Beauty & Spas,1.0,CG,"This salon was my worst experience ever. I went in for a simple gel manicure and the woman doing it had no idea what she was doing. She had a very rude attitude and seemed like she was in a rush. I told her I wanted my nails short and she said ""it's a long nail and it's a long nail"". I asked if she could make my nails short and she said ""it's long"". I told her I wanted coffin and she said ""no problem. ""  I left with square nails and my nails were not shaped."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I use to love this place. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the staff is so rude. The front desk girl is rude, and the owner is very rude. She talked to her co-workers in a very rude manner. I don't recommend coming here. I was looking for a place to get my nails done. I came here for the first time. I was very nervous about getting my nails done and they did a great job. I got acrylics and they look great. I'm so happy with my nails and I will be going back."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"The WORST place EVER to go get your eyebrows threaded! Anyone who's gotten their eyebrows threaded will understand where I am coming from. I should have known that this place wasn't really good when they didn't have a single client when I came in, I mean a place at the Tucson Mall that is empty!? Not a good sign. Anyway, everything was fine until she started threading below my eyebrows, she did it sooooooooooo slowly that the next day I had little cuts from it! Usually threading takes somewhere between 5-8 minutes IF anything, this one I swear it took about 20 minutes. It's been 2 days and it still feels sore as hell! Definitely NOT coming back there again."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"My boss sent me away from the office because I was coughing so bad. I just thought it was a really bad chest cold, but the fever was concerning as I'd had pneumonia before.
I went to In & Out and sat for a few minutes with some equally miserable people, but I was called back within about 15 minutes.
I was examined by a Nurse Practitioner. She was very pleasant and knowledgeable. Based on my symptoms, she ordered a flu swab and, much to my surprise, it came back positive.
Tamiflu, prednisone, and Tessalon Perles = I felt way better within a few days. 
I would recommend this clinic to family and friends. The staff are kind and the facility is clean."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I do not recommend this place. The tools are not sanitized at all. When the lady start to cut my cuticles , I saw other people's cuticles on the cuticle cutter. 

I had a French manicure for my wedding. It was the most unflattering French manicure I've ever done. I kept telling her I want a small tip and to get rid of the corners to make it look less round. But she only fixed one nail and the rest of them are still with a thick white tip that circles around the the nail. I hate it , went to another place immediately to redo it. Wasted 40 bucks on this shitty manicure. Btw, it's called Veda nails now"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"After an almost decade of living in Indy I think I finally found my haircut place in witch hazel! I have been saying to stylists for years that my hair feels ""so heavy"" and after a million different styles (most of them not flattering or what I want or even the requested length - eeeek!) Erin has found what works for me and several days after my cut I am still happy and satisfied with how it looks and I feel comfortable! In addition to being satisfied with the product - can we talk about their gorgeous twinkle light, exposed brick and tarot decor? I'm in love with it. Wish I had found this place sooner! I'll def be back!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"1st time at this nail salon.  The only reason why I went to this salon, is my regular salon is being renovated. I just wanted  to get a gel mani and pedicure.   There was no one in the salon when we arrived. We were seated immediately. The pedicure was alright , I have had better. 
Then it was time for my manicure, and a completely different person did my nails. It was a gentleman, no name tag. I will admit that this gentleman gave me one of my best manicures.  It took the time to do my nails, loves the shape and my nails felt fresh. 
Sadly he did not talk to me at all."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Poorly trained technicians who are left on their own.  I went in for a gel pedi and it took 2 hours!!  Poor thing was sweet and trying very hard, but obviously not equipped to work solo yet!!  2 differ people just kept coming by to check on her throughout the 2 hours.  After I left, finally, and saw the results I was very disappointed.  She did a nice job on all the prep work, just took away too long!! But the nail polish looks like my 12 year old applied it!!!  What a mess!  Definitely NOT worth the $66 dollars!  50 delux pedi, 10 gel, 1 ""processing CC fee"" + 5 tip"

I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I waited for 45 minutes before someone even acknowledged me. I was then told to pick a color.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"So based on previous reviews, I decided to try this place out. I have been to the other places before but the service I received was sub-par. The first time I went, I was told it would be 30 minutes, then it was 30 minutes. I was told that the lady was running behind because she was running behind. I told her that I was running late and she didn't seem to care. She kept saying that she didn't have a good day so she would have to come back in a few hours. I finally got my nails done, she just didn't seem to understand"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,I went to get a manicure and pedicure for my first time. I was greeted by a very friendly woman and I sat right down. The manicure was great and I enjoyed it. I'll be back. I will be back. I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous because I had a lot of high expectations. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The gentleman who did my nails was super sweet and did a great job! My toes look great and I will definitely be back.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I'd been thinking about getting a tattoo and thought it would be a nice place for a quick tattoo. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm a very picky person and had no idea where to go. The shop was clean and everyone was very friendly. I had a tattoo done by a different artist and I had a very good experience. I definitely recommend this shop. It's very clean and the tattoo artists are very friendly. I'm very happy with my tattoo. I will be going back for sure.I love this place! I have been here a few times
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Overwhelmed with skincare products and the staffs are very friendly. My first visit, I was given a free sample of the facials, which I thought was a great price. I was taken to the room and waited in the massage room for about 15 minutes. After my facial, I was given a tour of the spa and it was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was offered a bottle of water which was a nice touch. I will definitely be back!I've been to this nail salon a couple of times. I'm not sure why the first time"

The massage chairs were great and the place was very clean. We had a mani/pedi. My gel manicure started chipping within 2 days. 

They did a great job of cleaning up my nails. They were able to remove the gel and cut my cuticles very carefully. They even gave me a paraffin wax.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"THE worst office staff experience one can have. 

They're incompetent, unthorough, & even rude:
I just called & asked for the current 'office manager', who was the person I thought I'd spoken to last time. The person who answered (who called herself 'the owner', but not the doctor),= kept asking me where I was calling from & what I wanted. I told her Santa Barbara twice, & the same as above, then she calmly said she will hang up, & when I expressed my surprise, she actually hung up on me! It was surreal!

They advertise perpetually in the local paper, which is worthless & necessary with this kind of attitude, because word-of-mouth certainly won't keep them busy!

I'm done with them for good!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The ambiance is great, but the LITTLE TO NO experience the technicians have,  over rides that! I have been going for a while to many different technicians, until enough is enough. One tech. couldn't do a FRENCH MANICURE with regular POLISH, basic nail essential, Harrison blamed it on a ""different technique."" Next time, A different girl didn't know how to use POWEDWR GEL, piled on layer after layer. Finally my last time here Igot a pedicure , asking for ombré sparkles, and SHOWED A PICTURE, well i have globs of messy thick sparkles all over not at all in ombré. I tried many times, going to a nail a salon that can truly paint nails now in downtown St.Pete ."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I had a facial with Vicki (about 3 weeks so) and it was awesome.  She wasn't judgmental when I told her I had been using ivory soap on my face, but thinking back, she'd probably had a minor heart attack!  And...she totally resolved my skin issues in one visit.  It's really amazing...all the little bumps and blemishes I had are gone.  And I'm now a believer in the dr hauschka products.  It is pricey, but considering the results, well worth it.  I also have to mention the relaxed atmosphere...coming from the mainline spas where i often feel under dressed...eviama is a beautiful inviting space with out any of the pretentiousness.  Ill definitely be back."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This is by far the best salon for powder dip SNS type nails that I have been to since moving to Indianapolis. Not only are the staff incredibly friendly and funny, their work is top notch. I have been to many nail salons in the north Indy area over the last 4 years trying to find a place who does high quality dip and now I FINALLY found it! Look no further this place is the real deal. Your powder dip nails will not only look perfect but they will not chip or crack either like many other dip salons in the area. They also take appointments which is recommended. Thank you Lilly Nails I'm so glad I finally found you!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Zami was on time and super easy to work with For our coed circus baby shower! 
The kids loved getting their face painted and making balloons. She went back and forth between making balloons for adults when kids were not yet at the party. She did crowns and fun things for all ages. Her face painting skills are incredible. She took the kids during gift opening time without me even asking or reminding her and did a bubble show for little ones so they were entertained. At the very end a few kids showed up late and she did their face too. I will for sure book her again and again for parties! Worth the money! 
Wonderful service!! Thank you Zami."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,I keep going back here hoping that the place had improved but it's not.  It used to be great. I called repeatedly for an appointment and kept getting an answering machine during normal business hours. Once in awhile I'm sure that you can't get the phone  but it was like this days at a time at different times over a couple of weeks. I left messages and never got a return call. I finally got someone on the phone and was able to make an appointment and got a rushed and mediocre massage.  The place was empty. I'm wondering if anyone cares about the business anymore. It's a shame. I miss the way it used to be here.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I used to go here when I was in college. It was the first place I ever got Brazilians ... And I didn't know better.

Honestly, Emma was so mean to me (and some of my friends). She really made me feel like a hairy beast. It was embarrassing and rude, and I usually left in pain, and feeling really low about myself. As if it was my fault that I have hair. (Isn't that why I went to get waxed?)

Don't go here. Anthony at O2 is the same price, and really, really nice. When I came back to Philly last year I almost went back to International, but started to go to him instead. Honestly? It's a world of a difference."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"After driving around to what I thought was an old school barber shop, I decided to go to a place in the area. I was told by the receptionist that it was going to be a five minute wait. I waited a bit and was told I could still get in for a haircut. I waited a few minutes and I was told to wait. I was so excited to get there when I had to leave. I was asked if I was getting a haircut since I was from the area and I said yes, I am a local, and I was going to be in a shop with an old"

And for the sake of the self-confidence, I am a regular at Amrita, so it should be that it's a little more convenient to me, as it's not really worth it.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I did reserve my room in this hotel almost three months ago. When you are reserving your room, one the first questions is about your bed type! King or queen? 
And, I selected King. 
Tonight, at check in time you hear there is no king available! Your selection is not guaranteed! 
Are you kidding? If it is not, why do you ask during reservation/ hotel searching process? 

I never had this kind of problem, anywhere anytime ...
And so sorry for this kind of management. 

I asked them to change my room and the only answer I got was I am sorry!!! They gave me the worth room in the hotel! Queen bed, and the most far room from elevator...

Unhappy to stay here."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Holly deserves more than 5 stars, but what can you do? I just moved to NOLA from San Francsico and was in search of a new hair person. I happened upon Holly's yelp page and decided I would try her out - since basically all of her reviews are amazing. I was more than impressed when I arrived for my appointment. Holly is not only a master barber that gave me a fantastic new haircut (more detailed than I think I have ever had before) but she was an absolute joy to talk to. She is professional, personable and just has a great character. Needless to say I will not be going to anyone else during my time in NOLA."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I used to go here exclusively because it is very clean, and the staff was always so sweet.  I stopped going after I got a particular tech a couple of times in a row.  It was very off-putting to pay money for a relaxing experience with a tech that was rude, rushed, and looked like she couldn't wait for me to leave.  I left one time with a bloody cuticle, and the next time with a burn mark on the top of my foot from the hot stone!  I do appreciate the kindness of the rest of the staff, and I would definitely return if I could be guaranteed not to have the young angry tech ever again."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"If you want a salon that knows what they are doing - this is the place to go! 

It has a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere and I definitely recommend making an appt!  I came to get my hair fixed after going to another salon a few days prior where I left very unhappy with my haircut. I stopped in close to closing time and Doug was so kind and friendly. He asked what I didn't like about my hair and listened to what I wanted. He was detailed, took time to listen and made my hair look so much better. It was such a good experience and I'm so thankful I stopped in."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I love Charlie and his salon. I've been to him probably five times for cuts and two times for color since discovering his place. His haircuts and color are always what I ask for and my hair looks great not just the day of service but for months afterward. Plus the prices are really reasonable. I've searched for a good stylist for years across multiple cities and I've finally found the person who can give me ""dream hair."" For what it's worth I've been wearing my wavy hair naturally curly for over a year and Charlie is great at cutting it so it accentuates the waves. I'm already worried about what I'll do this coming year when I move from STL temporarily!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"There aren't really enough words to describe how positive my experience was at Breakthru. Every person there is delightful and is genuinely concerned about each client's well-being. Kevin is exceptional! He continually assessed my pain levels and kept them under control with appropriate exercises and masterful taping of my ankle. Meghan and Jose were incredibly helpful to me in every exercise prescribed. At the front desk, Nicole and all the ladies were a delightful way to start the day with their warm greeting and sweet smiles. All in all, my experience with BreakThru was one I will talk about to everyone I know with physical therapy needs. P.S. Every physical therapist I saw treating patients did so with incredible gentleness and care."

I got incredibly lucky that Halley was available that same day to give my hair some much needed TLC. She is the sweetest person and truly made me feel heard in terms of what I was looking for in my new hair style.

I only went here because it's three minutes from my home, but honestly I think I might drive into town and go to my regular lady. My gel pedi was painted on quite thick and for my dip powder manicure, I've barely had it for a week and it can be peeled off at the base and it's getting caught in my hair. Quite overpriced for the quality. I usually get paraffin wax for my feet and the lady looked at me like she has never heard of it before. Place is meh. I wanted to like it but it is what it is."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I can't recommend LA Nails enough, they are incredible.   This was my first pedicure since the pandemic started and they did everything possible to make it a good experience.  You need to make an appointment since they're not taking walking but I appreciated that, knowing the salon wouldn't be full of people waiting.  They have you wash your hands when you arrive, take your temp and give you gloves to select your polish.

I opted for the volcano pedi which was $55.  It was the best pedicure I have ever had and so reasonably priced.  The attention to detail was beyond measure and no rushing through it.  

I can't wait to go back for my next pedi!"

And I love the fitness classes. But lately, they are full. Even when I get there a 1/2 hour early. They need to expand the area or ? Another room next Otherwise, I will have to go to another gym. Chuze please fix this so I can be happy again!!

Update: Noticed classes being added in the evening. But for me this doesn't help. The problems are in the morning. And the classes are added late in the day. 6 pm.  But it might help some others."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I regret having walked in. Redeeming quality? They serve you wine or mimosas while they give you a truly half-hearted gel manicure.

My nails were buffed to the point of pain. I'm pretty sure I don't have a top coat on my gel. I stopped paying attention after I realized how my nails were turning out and I didn't have time to have them done over again. I got the manicure 4 days ago and two nails have already chipped. 

My friend actually said to me, without provocation, "" You PAID for those nails?! I thought you did them yourself. No offense."" It's a rude comment, but not without its meaning. 

Please pay better attention when you're charging FORTY DOLLARS for a gel manicure."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,My eyebrows have NEVER looked this great. I just moved to Tampa and had a ceremony to go to so of course I waited until the last minute to get my eyebrows done etc. I walked in without an appointment and within 5 minutes I was sitting in the chair ready for Dak to work her magic. One of my eyebrows has a funky scar that ALWAYS  seems to mess it up and I'm never really happy with how it turns out. Dak shaped it so you couldn't tell it was there. She also made sure to get EVERY SINGLE stray hair so I didn't have to pluck my eyebrows after I just got them done. Could not recommend this place enough!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"My first visit to Waxing the City was with the owner of the Waxing the City.  I had an appointment with Kelli, who was fantastic!  She was great, made me feel comfortable and welcomed.  She took her time and was very professional.  She also made me feel comfortable.  I highly recommend Kelli.  She made me feel very comfortable and comfortable.  I will be back!I used to go to Mimi's a few years ago. Now it's been years since I've been. I've never been dissatisfied with my services.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I've been going off and on for the last 10 years.  I always walk in and the staff is so friendly.  I get a gel manicure and pedicure and it's worth the money.  I've been to other places for manicures and pedicures and this is my favorite place to go!  I'm very particular about my nails and they always do a great job.  They have a lot of colors to choose from and always offer great suggestions.  They have a huge selection of gel colors.  I love that they have a great selection of colors and are always willing to
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Front desk people are intent on selling you their massage packages. Your money and time would be better spent elsewhere. Therapist did NOT take my preferences or concerns into account. I asked for deep tissue and to focus on neck, shoulder and upper back. I paid for 90 minute massage and she spent LESS THAN 10 minutes working on the areas I requested. I requested more pressure on the upper back area. I got more pressure everywhere else and the equivalent of a back rub on my upper back. Therapist seemed to focus on areas I did not want touched. Two days later, I am incredibly sore and covered with bruises."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I have been coming here for just about year every 3 weeks and I being my daughters .Sally and Tony are our favorites, I make appointments and I never have to wait more then 5 minutes or so .They do a very good job with pedicures using that cheese grader looking thing getting all that nasty stuff off feet great about cutting out ingrown nails on me and my daughter.The nails any design I pick off internet they have been able to nail .I also got eyelash extensions for about 6 months there and I loved them very natural looking .All around great place for me , clean I watch them clean everything after the pedicure and take clean instruments out before the pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been a patron for 4 years.  Always the best service and ambiance.  This place is impossible for a gentleman not to love.  It's odd to me that people would go anywhere else in NOLA to get a haircut/shave.  This shop is elite and everything about it exudes perfection.  

Pick up any men's magazine...GQ a few years back, the most recent addition of Playboy magazine rating the place #1 Barbershop in the US.  

Hunter S. Thompson walked in to get a shave one month before his death, lighting up a smoke.  If you cannot appreciate that you might fare better at the posing barber shop further down magazine st or finding a nice salon for your highlights."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This was the worst experience I have ever had. I've been going to Paris Parker for years in BR so I thought they were going to have the same quality, but I was wrong. I had schedule highlights and the two things I had asked about was to look natural and not yellow. Turns out I get out of there with a egg yolk hair color and with highlight marks after sitting for her to correct a mark on my bang for 4 hours. Absolutely insane. So I basically ended up with having the opposite of what I wanted and having to come back to a different location to have it reserviced. I do not recommend Savannah from Paris Parker at the Lakeside Mall."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Stopped by Body Graphics for a couple of piercings last night and had the pleasure of talking with Pixie about all of my options. She was professional, thorough and chock full of information. She pierced my ears with 6g glass and gave me a new Jestrum piercing as well. She was so sweet and explained everything she was doing from start to finish.  Her technique was smooth and there was VERY MINIMAL discomfort. Pricing was fantastic and her aftercare instructions were easy to understand. I couldn't believe how well I slept last night and honestly I have ZERO pain or discomfort today! I am shocked, hence why I am writing this review! I would recommend Pixie to anyone looking for a new piercing!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"All I can say is ... wow!! I don't normally post Yelp reviews, but I was super impressed by DnA. We had a hair donation drive at church today, and two of the stylists showed up to offer free haircuts to people who donated. The thing about donating 8"" is that you never really know what it will look like afterwards. After cutting off my ponytail, Jenika spent the next 45 minutes meticulously cutting and styling my hair. And the end result was amazing! Probably the artsiest haircut I've had before, and the compliments are already coming in. :) The stylists are great, and what makes them even more amazing is that they volunteered their time on their day off for a good cause."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I called in and was met by the owner mid week for some work, he was gracious and met me at the shop shortly after opening time (he was running late but kept in comm with me).

The shop is nice and clean with cool artwork on the walls, an amazing artist, I brought in my own design and the owner made the stencil exactly as I wanted it.  For future visits though I think I'll give him concept and leave the design to him, seeing his other artwork was inspiring and gave me confidence to go back.  

I got two arrows and some native writing on my forearm, was done in about two hours which included a break and some entertaining conversation."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I found this place through Groupon and thought it would be a great place for a massage. The atmosphere is very peaceful and calm, and the massage therapists are very attentive to detail. The therapists are both friendly and professional. I would highly recommend them if you are looking for a massage. I was looking for a place to get my nails done and I came across this place. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was nice and clean. The tech was very nice and did a great job on my nails. She was very thorough and careful with my nails. I'm sure I will be back."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I have been going to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk.  The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly.  

The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language.  I have been going to this nail salon for over a year now and I am really happy with the"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I have been a client here for the last 10 years.  I have always been pleased with the results.   The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing.   The only thing I wish is that they have a coffee shop.  I always get the gel polish and it lasts 2 weeks!  I go to Cindy and she does a great job.  She is very attentive and cares about her clients.   The prices are reasonable and the quality of her work is excellent.  I recommend going to Tina's.  They are worth the price!I have been here twice and have had good
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Wasn't impressed with how the woman did my nails. She was rude and didn't seem to care. I had to ask her to be careful and she seemed annoyed when I asked her to clean it up. 

The next day, one of my nails is still sore and chipped. I'm not sure if the woman who did my nails was new or not, but she did a very good job. I'm sure it was just my cuticle that needed to be cleaned up.I had a great experience at this location. I got a Brazilian wax with Roxanne. She was super nice and knowledgeable"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"It was okay. The hair dresser kept pulling my hair out of my hair, which was uncomfortable. Then she cut the hair. I thought that was okay, but when she cut it she kept cutting it. It was a little painful, but it was not painful at all. I also felt a bit rushed because I didn't want to make a scene. I think that was the only reason I went there. I'm sure it was because I was getting a good haircut, but I was definitely not expecting much. I would have paid for a better cut. I was just in a rush to get out of there"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Updated review: After a year of not liking the way my nails turned out, I decided to go to a different salon. The owner, Rose, is the most adorable person you'll meet. She's extremely personable and very personable. I have never had an issue with her. I always get compliments on my nails and I always feel very comfortable and pampered. I highly recommend Rose.

Go here.

This is where you go for top notch customer service, excellent service, quiet, private service.
Portia is a sweetie and loves her business and makes sure you are comfortable and ready to get pretty..
Call her, make an appt, go get pretty!  Her services are not crazy expensive like so many other day spas..

I will update my review after I return for more lashes..
She's right across the street from Elm Hill Vet ---- another 5 star business.

We are so lucky to have great independent businesses to frequent, in Donelson.  I hope you take a minute and check out Esthetics by Portia.
I plan to make this my ""private time"" activity.  My very special place."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I'm a fan.  If you want a cheap, no frills but high quality haircut, this is the place to go.  Larry is a good guy and always does a great job with my hair.  Strongly recommend.

edit - been going here near a year now so I figured I would update.  I'd say about 50% of the time, my hair looks exactly how I want it after leaving.  Another 45%, it's pretty close (and good enough for $13).  But it does seem like 5% of the time, I leave a bit surprised at how it turned out.  So overall, for $13, it's still good and worth it, just know that every once in a while it doesn't work out."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I definitely do NOT recommend this office for any dermatological needs.  I called in advance and they told me how much my visit would be.  I paid it in-office.  Then the doctors visit was less than useless.  Everything out of her mouth was 'I don't know' or was prefaced with 'I think...'.  THEN I get a bill for another $28 a month later, adding insult to injury.  When I called to tell them about the visit and that I wasn't going to pay the additional money they said they didn't really have anyone there to deal with customer service issues and would send me to collections.  This is the kind of service you will receive from this office."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I really wanted to love this place. The whole set up is really cute and relaxing however the service doesn't really match up. My friend and I booked appointments together on a Monday afternoon and there was only one nail tech working. The receptionist was in a rush to get out of there and it showed. We asked if we could get a mimosa (they advertise Monday mimosas), and she said they stopped that special and walked out and told the nail tech she would close by herself. As for the nails, with one nail tech working our nail date turned into my friend waiting for me to finish my nails and vice versa. However, my nails came out good and the prices were reasonable."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I am quite particular about my hair for a multitude of reasons. One, I have curly hair. Two, I am very blonde. And three, I have had a lot of bad colors. Therefore I get scared to let someone alter my hair. I have been growing my hair out and wanted a more natural look. There was a stark contrast from my dark natural color grow out to my beach blonde on the ends. So I saw Misha for a ""reverse ombre"". Meaning she pulled my natural color (low lights) though the top and middle but still left the bottom blonde. It turned out great! I trusted her every part of the way. I would highly recommend seeing Misha, she is knowledgeable and a professional."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I came in for a nail repair and a gentleman of the name  Sebastian was extremely rude and seemed to have an attitude about doing my nails as he asked where did o get them done, which I replied at another nail bar in the cool spring location.. he also roughly with my hands and when I told him that he didn't seemed happy about repairing my nail he said he was too focused to be gentle..  I paid him and also asked to speak with a manger he become argumentative and called me ghetto.. none of the receptionist apologized for his behavior nor was any empathy shown towards his racist remark.. I'll never return to this location and I'm very upset !"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Finally stopped by to try this place out and was not disappointed! I went with their deluxe pedicure and they did a wonderful job! She took her time and made sure to do it right. After she was done with my nails, the owner, Cammy, came over and introduced herself to me which I thought was super nice.

The inside was very clean and well kept, but the exterior really needs some work. Honestly, the appearance from the outside has kept me from going in before. It's poorly done and is sort of makes it look like a dump. Now that I know they have good service I will be back, but they really need to improve their signage and exterior because it is definitely off-putting."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"For a lot of people reading this, a trip to the barber shop is likely to be as frequent as the moon cycle. At roughly six hours (or more) per year, a stylist possessing both social and cosmetic skills is a necessity; Samantha Masterson is the epitome of such things. 

Having spent every waking hour in the last three years augmenting my whiskers, my trust in Samantha is second only to my mother. Her ability to anticipate my desires of physical appearance above the neck makes the trip to Scout's Barbershop in Wedgewood more synonymous with a sabbath than scut work. Arranging an appointment comes with such ease that even with my consistently unpredictable schedule, Sam is always flexible and timely at the zero hour."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"They fu*#**ck up my hair. 

We decided to go back for a fix and just wanted a trim.  The front desk girl took us back to the back to get it fixed.  When we walked in, I was told it would be $50 for the haircut.  We were told it was $50 and they would give me the cut I wanted.  They told me to come back later and they would charge me $50.  We agreed to go back to the back to get it fixed, but no one called back to confirm it.  I was told that it was $"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I am beyond happy with my nails and the service. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same stylist for many years now and she always does an amazing job. She takes her time and is very precise. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and it's always a pleasure to see her. I have been going to Oggi for several years now and have never had a bad experience. The salon is very clean, very friendly, and the staff is very helpful. I usually have a mani/pedi, but I usually have a gel manicure."

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I went in for a pedicure and the lady was rude and didn't even ask how I wanted my nails painted. I asked her to get the gel polish off and she did that. She was so rude and even said it was fine. I was charged $45 for the gel polish. I will never go back and will tell all my friends not to go here.I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon. I have had both mani and pedi and they have been very nice and professional. I recommend this salon to everyone.I have been here twice now
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I did not enjoy my time here at all. The pedicure was just ok. The girl did not speak very good English, which is understandable, but the paint job was sloppy. She was rushing and rushed. She rushed through the whole manicure and didn't file my nails with the electric file. I was disappointed because I was getting a full set with a basic manicure. I was charged $45 for a full set and they didn't even last two days. I don't think I will be returning. I have been going to this nail salon for almost three years now and I am very pleased."

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I came on a recommendation of friend. I went in for a full set of acrylics, and a reference photo of what I wanted. I wanted long coffin shaped nails. As he was trimming the tips I said that they were too short and asked for them to be longer, he literally said no. Then he proceeded to finish my nails and NOT shape them at all. He filed them completely square! All while he was doing my nails he was texting the ENTIRE TIME. When the bill came, I was charged an extra $5 for REGULAR nail polish, not even gel! He also hit my nail as it was drying and left  huge dent. I would give this place a zero if I could."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Wish I would have found this place sooner! I was early for my appointment and was immediately offered to be seated. Offered a beverage choice of water, hot tea, or mimosa. Wide selection of both regular and gel polishes. A lot of reds to choose from! The basic pedi is wonderful and relaxing. Nice massage, gentle foot scrubbing. I also got a gel manicure and am very pleased with how my nails look and feel. The shoulder massage while waiting for nails to dry was a nice added touch. Mimi and Segundo were excellent. They accept credit cards though ask folks not to tip on the card, so there is an ATM in the shop ($1.75 service fee). Clean and professional atmosphere. Will be returning again."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place is amazing for the price you pay. 
I got my balayage and haircut done by Kaitlyn. She did amazing! The photos don't do it justice. She got the perfect color and placement for all the highlights. I have straight hair so it was really important that it blends well when not styled and she did just that. It looks so natural! It feels like it's still my hair color, just with some sun high lights. 
Go see Kaitlyn for your color and cut needs! 
The staff is very nice too, you get a gift back when you walk in, your choice of water, wine or coffee, a coupon scratch off for products in store. 
I am so glad I found a stylist I trust."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have gone to Sarah Sidiqi for a couple of years now for Botox. I started with her at her previous spa location and loved her (and accidentally booked someone different at the same spa and was disappointed in my results -which only made me confirm my love for how she does her injections!) Now I've followed her to Body + Beauty Lab! She's always careful to analyze my face each time and offer new suggestions for placements and openly talk about other procedures I've experienced. 

Pain is minimal and her personality is so kind, it helps you feel at ease. I'll be going to Sarah as long as I'm still in Philadelphia! She's great and careful with what she does and informative about her work."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was in recently in the area for a wedding and was delighted to find a blowout bar near my hotel. My appt was at 10:30, but I was not taken for my wash until about 10:45. The blowout went alright, but I never got the look I was hoping for. I asked my stylist to put in a few pins, which was a simple twist in the back and took her all of 3 extra minutes to do and guess what happened when I went to pay- I got charged for an updo! To top it off, the curls fell out immediately and I had to fix my own hair twice back in my hotel room. What an unfortunate waste of my time and money."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Went in on a Saturday. It is Wednesday and my Gel is already starting to peel. 

Onto my Experience: While I was taken quickly (I had an appointment), I never recieved my complimentary drink even though I had been offered wine. My pedicure was fine, but there was no massage. Moving onto the manicure. There was a lot of untended cuticle left in my nails. After the mani, again no massage on my hands even though every person around me was getting that service included. Then, I get into my car and realize how sloppy the manicure was. The topcoat was stuck to the bottom of my finger and was difficult to peel apart. It also left a rough edge. 

I will not be back again."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I went to Volume for the first time yesterday after reading the great reviews on YELP.  I could not have been happier with my experience.  This was my first post-baby haircut and my layers were an absolute mess.  Stephanie was awesome. Super friendly and made me feel at ease.  More importantly, she gave me a fantastic haircut and one of the best blow outs that I have had in a long time.  I went during lunch and all of my co-workers commented how great I looked when I got back.  The whole vibe of the salon was friendly and unpretentious.  I am so happy I met Stephanie and now have stylist I trust in walking distance from my office."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Oh my gosh I was beyond impressed. Yelena is the sweetest, most professional woman whom you will immediately trust with a pair of sharp tweezers near your eye. She is very fast and gives the perfect results. The room is very relaxing and everything about it is there to make you the most comfortable during the session. She is extremely flexible, willing to work 12 hour days and even some Sundays, which just goes to show how much she values each client! She has the best prices, I got the spring special which was $125 for a full new set which is originally 280. I can't imagine going to any other lash sylist and I can safely say I'm a lifetime client."

They are always very friendly and always have a great time
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,"I was requested to show up early and the girl at the front desk was very rude and rude. I asked for the phone number, and she said the phone number was changed. I was told to call her and get a call back from the manager. I was told the manager would call me back. I was told the phone number was changed. I was told to come back later. I called back and spoke to the manager and asked if she could call me back. She said that it was the manager and that the manager would call me back. I explained that she was in a rush and it was my birthday."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I'm so sad. From the time I walked in, I was greeted by a very sweet and friendly staff. 

I am a former nail technician myself and have had great experiences with many different nail salons. I have been to several different nail salons and this one is the only one that I will go to!

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Worst haircut I have ever had. The woman who cut my hair did not listen to what I wanted. She cut the sides of my hair down and the top of my hair is completely different. She had no clue what she was doing. I told her I wanted to keep the length but she gave me layers that look the same. I had to tell her to fix the layers. I have never had a stylist fix a hair that they didn't like. I will not be coming back to this salon. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. 

I was very upset with this and will never go back"

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was given a gift card to this location for one standard 60 minute massage. The staff were quite friendly and welcoming. The facility was clean and appealing. My masseuse was named Theresa. She was pleasant and did a wonderful job on the massage itself, however, half way through the massage she called me by the wrong name and it was awkward. Secondly,  this business is neighbor to an ice cream shop. It just so happens my room was directly beside the shop and I had the joy of listening to blenders for the entire duration of the treatment. Bummer. Not so relaxing,  but an enjoyable massage for the fact that it was not at my expense. I would not schedule a future appointment there."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"It was my first visit here and I was a little disappointed. Not disappointed in the service or the way my nails were done, but in the product used. They must have used a cheap top coat on my regular polish manicure. As soon as I got home I noticed every one of my nails had bubbles all over them (see picture). Then the next day, I went in a pool and my nails became sticky. It was like the pool water melted the top coat. Within hours after that all of the polish smudged or came off. 

The woman who did my nails was very nice and did a great job on the actual pedicure and manicure. Next time I may just bring my own products."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Hubby and I were able to walk in and get massages right away. I love that they operate on a purely walk in basis because they usually have someone free. Hubby and I each got the half & half massages. It was just the relaxing little pick me up I needed. I got the knots worked out and a foot soak. I really appreciated that all the staff was quiet, so it was nice and relaxing. When I go to places in my hometown, they often start talking to each other and it ruins my zen. This was tranquil and I was able to fully relax. It's no frills, so don't be expecting a spa, but it's a great way to ease the tension in your muscles."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Don't believe the hype!  I thought the stylist, Cassandra, and I were on the same wave length, but I left the salon in tears with a cut and color no where near what I wanted AND I paid $200 for it (without being given any breakdown of charges).  It has been 10 weeks, and I'm still trying to grow out one of the epically worst cuts/colors I have ever received.  Oh, and I almost forgot, they give you a ""parting gift"" of a basket with all the product the stylist used on you with the assumption that you will purchase everything.....on top of the worst $200 cuts/colors I can recall!  Stay away.  Your hair and bank account will thank you for it!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Nice brand new location just opened in large busy strip mall. The place was clean, well organized, and had several stylists working. There was no wait for a haircut. They had several hair products for sale. We were greeted as we entered. The actual haircut was not great and a bit uneven. The area over the ears on one side was buzzed down more than the area over the other ear. This was very noticeable if you look at both sides. 
The place was great, but the haircut not so much. At least it'll grow back, lol. Cost was abput $15, but they have coupons for about $10 haircut in the mail and on the bottom of your receipt for your next visit. If you go back..."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I've had my membership with this place for years and I've never had a bad experience. The owner is super nice and the staff is very friendly. I'm a very picky person and I don't get the feeling that they can do a good job. The staff is always very friendly and they have the most convenient location. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a service I've gotten there. The location is a little hard to find but it's worth it for the distance. I've never been dissatisfied with a service I've gotten and will continue to go.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Great place to get a haircut. The guys are friendly and professional. I have been to the other barbers in the area and they are all excellent.I have had great massages by Angel and I have been in a few different places. I have had massages from both of the massage therapists. Angel is a great massage therapist. 

I have had massages from both different therapists and have never been disappointed. I am very particular about my massages and Angel does not disappoint. I highly recommend Angel for your massage.I love this place! I have been here a few times, and have always had great service."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,The girl work overnight (she has the appointment) and I saw her for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I was seen within 5 minutes. The place is very clean and everyone was friendly. It was a very relaxing experience. I will be back!The staff was very nice. The place was clean and nicely decorated.  The massage was good but the manicure was poor.  I paid $25 for a gel manicure and $30 for a pedicure.  I would not recommend this place.I've been here for about a year now.  My favorite place to get my nails done. 
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"After months of jumping from salon to salon, I decided to try a new stylist. I came in for a simple cut, and they did a great job. I was very pleased with my hair cut. I will be back for sure. I've been coming here for about a year now and I've never had a bad experience. They are very clean and the staff is very professional. They have a lot of colors to choose from and always offer great suggestions. They do a great job on my nails and have a wide range of nail colors. They are always very friendly and always have a great time."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Love this place! Clean, friendly, and a great quality pedicure. 

The massage chairs are a nice touch. The massage chairs are also very comfortable. 

The other thing that I like about this place is that they do a very thorough job on my nails. I also love that they use a lot of natural products which is great!I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the nail technicians are always happy to answer my questions! I have been going to Angel for years now and she is the best. I've never been disappointed! She does a great job and I always leave feeling like I"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I am usually extremely picky about my nails and I just wasn't happy with my last experience. I came in for a fill and a pedicure, and the woman who did my nails did a terrible job. She cut me 3 times and when I asked for a refund she was rude and said ""No"". I will never go back.I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found it to be very frustrating to find a good nail salon that can do nails exactly how I want. I was in the area for a wedding and I was looking for a new place to go for a fill"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,Went in with my friend who wanted her nails done today. Waited twenty minutes and another woman came in (no she did not have an appointment) ten minutes later that woman was being helped and my friend and I were still waiting. Then one of the ladies told us to come back in the morning because she wouldn't be able to do my friends nails that day. Even though 30 minutes earlier she said that she would. As we were getting up to leave she then tried to make us stay after we said we would go somewhere else. She actually squatted in front of my chair and held my legs down so that I couldn't move while she was talking to my friend. Will never be back.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Honestly, my nails have never looked better. I went to Genesis last night for their opening special - mani/pedi for $30 (normally $40). Though $30 may be the norm for other nail salons at this price, I have yet to find one that includes hot stones, a hand massage, and a neck and shoulder massage while your nails are drying for that price. What a great place! Saijai, the woman who did my nails, was extremely friendly and sweet. I paid $5 to get a Membership Card, which means that each time I go, I receive points for each dollar that I spend. Those points translate into free services in the future. I will definitely be going back to this place.  A great addition to the neighborhood!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been a patient here for years, and feel like each visit I'm coming to see friends. From the front desk staff to the nurses, my PA Nikki, billing and the check out desk staff, everyone is always so friendly and helpful. I rarely wait more than about 5 minutes for my appointments, which is rare in this industry. Their office is comfortable and very nice, in a great location adjacent to I-65 in Cool Springs. I've only been here for the medical side, but they also offer skin and laser treatments I might use in the future. Although I ended up moving an hour away from this office, I never once considered finding a new dermatologist. Thanks to Nikki, my skin looks better than it ever has!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Who doesn't take walk-ins after paying $2.50 for parking... oh! Let me answer that question!!!! This unprofessional place. Don't bother. They are rude and not personable at all. It was my first time! Trust me when I say this, I'm telling everyone that I know to never step foot in this ridiculously, utterly disrespectful place called a basic NAIL SALON! How embarrassing it is as a working mom, who finally found a babysitter to watch her child and wanted to spontaneously treat herself. I walked in and was embarrassed to not have an appointment. Horrible for my self confidence. Depression is real and when a overworked mom wants to get her nails done. Too bad this place doesn't cater to that. 


Sincerely, 

Mom who wanted her nails painted."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been to many nail spots but this one keeps me coming back!

They have plenty of spaces for pedicures and manicures and they do great shellac manicures. They accept walk ins and you are also welcome to make appointments. 

I have received services from several of the nail techs and they have all done a great job with pedicures and shellac manicures. The service is always friendly and the wait is usually none or just a few minutes. I also like the variety of colors they have available for both regular polish and shellac. 

They offer other services such as waxing but I haven't utilized that. 

The prices are reasonable compared to other nail salons they're are pretty much average priced. I would definitely recommend this place."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I always come here if I want to spoil myself and get a nice design on my nails. Although it is on the pricey side, you're definitely paying for quality. This salon does not compare to the cheap ones who do not take care of you! Joe is amazing at nail extensions-- My nails are thin and burn easily when they get filed down but Joe was very gentle and attentive to my sensitivity. He takes his time and his shaping/forming is meticulous. Someone else finished/colored my nails today and she was just as amazing. I also come here to get my eyelashes done-- They're on the natural side, but I like that best. La Palette is definitely the place to go to if you want great service."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I went in to get a fill and the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I had two nails that were crooked, and they're chipped after only a week. The place was packed when I went, so I came back for a fill and they did not have the workers working. I was also the only one in the shop and they were very rude. They made me feel like I was being treated poorly. They also didn't have a good selection of polishes for me to choose from. I will never go back to this place. I will definitely not be coming back here.I love this place! The owners"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Decided to try this place out. The woman who did my pedicure did a great job. She took her time and did a great job. The shop is clean and very relaxing. I'll be back.I have been a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. I always get a great haircut from the ladies and I can't wait to see a haircut from the owner. My husband had a great experience with my hair.I was looking for a new nail salon and found this one on yelp. I walked in, and was immediately greeted by a very sweet lady. The place is beautiful, and the staff"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I went for a pedicure. They did a great job. I will definitely be going back!I am a very picky person. I went to get a gel manicure and it was $35. I told them I wanted a gel manicure. I was charged $45 which was also $35. I was charged $50. I had to wait 30 minutes for my manicure. I was charged $55 for a gel manicure. The tech did a good job, however, it was very painful. I have been getting gel manicures for over 2 years now and this one lasted longer than expected."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"We visited the Atlantis as a last resort. We decided to stay at the Peppermill as the hotel is so close to our house, and we're glad we did. The room was nice, and we were greeted by a very nice young lady. We had to wait a bit for the casino to open up for us to leave, but the rooms were great. We had a great stay at the Peppermill, and it was pretty good. However, we ended up staying at the Peppermill for the second time. The room was nice, clean, and the casino was beautiful. We enjoyed the lounge and the pool, but the casino was"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"***I sincerely apologize I spelled this out and let me just say it was my first time getting a tattoo here and I had a great experience.  The shop itself is clean, professional and nice.  I'll definitely be back.I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was helped immediately and I was taken right away. I showed them a picture of what I wanted and they did a great job! The girl who did my nails was very nice and did a great job on my nails. She was very nice and I was happy with the results. I will be back!A friend of mine recommended"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I have always enjoyed coming here. The staff is friendly and professional. My pedicures last a long time.  The place is clean and the staff is always so nice.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and always get a great experience. 

I recently started getting a gel manicure. The manicurist is very nice and I have never had a bad experience. She does a great job and I always get a beautiful gel manicure every time"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I've had long hair for years and I've never been able to find someone who I can trust. I've had the pleasure of meeting with Heather and have never left disappointed. She's been cutting and coloring my hair for years and she always does an amazing job. I always leave feeling refreshed and confident. I have also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and they always look so great. They're always professional and quick. I've seen Heather and she's great at making sure you're comfortable and happy with your eyebrows. I've had a few bad experiences with other places and I always leave with a great eyebrow wax.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I don't ever do yelp reviews but I was so happy about my experience here. Everyone is so friendly and seems like they have a lot of returning customers as people kept coming in and were remembered by first name basis and seemed to be friends with the staff. The reason I'm leaving this review is because of how great my gel manicure was. I always hate when you go to get your nails done and they start the polish so far away from your cuticle, in two days it's all grown out and doesn't look pretty anymore. This definitely didn't happen here, my nails look amazing and Ivy did such a good job and so detailed oriented. I couldn't find anything wrong with it. So impressed."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Thankfully, I was able to walk in on a Friday afternoon and not wait.

My nail technician was ""Mary"" or ""Maria."" I love my manicure! For the pedicure, though, I feel as though she could have payed more attention to my cuticles/extra skin. Also, my big toe never seems to get entirely covered in paint! The sides  of my big toe had my old polish and looked gross (see photos).

They only have lavender scented lotions. Yuck.

Prices are OK:
$13 for manicure. $28 for basic pedicure. $41 total with 20% off new client coupon (clipper magazine), the price was $33.

The place is very clean. It was not filled with the usual  nail salon chatter, thankfully.

I probably won't come back for a pedicure but definitely will return for a polish change/manicure!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I left a quick tip but after a closer look at my haircut I feel I need to write a review. One of the worst I have ever had THANKS MARLA!
I wanted a trim around the ears and neck oddly enough I ended up with long uneven patches of hair around my sideburns and neck. She shaved clear up over the top so it looks like I have a ridiculous jock hawk. I need to find a barber to fix this now and pay more $$ or I will just shave it myself. Some of the girls there are good but if you name request one they get pissy about it. Just save yourself from looking like you have radiation poisoning like me and give this place a miss!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Terrible service. Guy acted like I was asking too much when I was trying to tell him how I wanted my nails. I decided to pick a different gel color after I sat down and he sarcastically offered to give me 5-10 mins to pick another color. Shape was wrong, even with example directly next to my hands. I didn't bother to try and correct him. Dirty. Lady came in when I was leaving with her daughter to request a refund because her daugther's cuticle was cut pretty bad and was inflamed. They refused a refund but offered to give back the $10 tip the teenager left (which is generous considering they were rough with her). Looks cute on the outside. Dont let that fool you. Go somewhere else."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Michelle actually saw me on Christmas eve, she somehow sensed I was struggling, tired and really needing some TLC and she really gave it to me. I had a wonderful organic massage and hands down, Michelle gave me the best hot stone experience I have ever had... it was magic. She also gave me a wonderful facial. When I asked her about the products she used she did not see that as an opportunity to try to sell products to me like many spas but pointed me to products that can do what I liked online. 

Michelle also does Hypnotherapy that I had not had the opportunity to try but I would really like to next time. She has a calm, compassionate and gentle presense that I really enjoyed."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Absolutely awful experience. I called and cancel my membership.and they continued to charge my account. After calling they basically said thats your problem and there was no way to give me MY money back. I would never trust a business that makes there money by deceiving their customers. They also claimed I had been their since, which was a lie. I would truly recommend staying away from this place. Pay a little bit extra and got to a nicer gym with employees that have integrity. The best part was when i received a call back from the employee that canceled my membership to tell me he was reactivating my membership because he didn't like that I called his manager...it was like dealing with children. Please please please stay away!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This casino/hotel would easily get 5 stars, except for the smoking.  The hotel itself is very nice and the room rates were very good for the quality of the rooms.
The casino area is nice and at least they do have a good non-smoking area with ~140 machines and a small smoke-free restaurant in that area (small and very chilled).
The best thing about the Peppermill are the video screens throughout that continuously display amazing videos recorded throughout the world by Joe Ness.  I really wish they would sell those videos - this is like having the best of National Geographic everywhere you look, except in a video.
Plenty of parking in a multi-story garage.  The pools looked nice, but since it is ~37F outside, we didn't try them."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I'm not sure how this happened. The woman who did my pedicure did a decent job. I had a very bad experience, but I figured I would try this place out again. I came in on a Monday and I was helped right away. I got a gel manicure with tips. The woman was very friendly and did a great job. She did a great job. I didn't get a manicure, I just got a regular manicure. I'll definitely be coming back to this salon for all of my nail needs.I'm not sure why I am giving this place a 3-star. I have been going here"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I have been coming to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk.  The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly.  

The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language.  I have been going to this nail salon for over a year now and I am really happy with the service and the quality of"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I wish they would let me leave the salon and try to fix it for free!Very rude. I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. I was very pleased with the service and the price. I'm a loyal customer for years and will be back. I have been a client at this nail salon for over a year. I have never had a bad experience. I always get a pedicure and it is always clean. The prices are very reasonable. The manicures are great and the service is impeccable. I highly recommend this salon!I had a great experience here. They were friendly and welcoming.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Dr. Claiborne and his entire team have been amazing!  I will continue to go to Dr. Claiborne for the best results!  He is the best doctor in the area and he takes time to look at all of your concerns and concerns.  I highly recommend Dr. Claiborne and his team!  I am very satisfied with my results and I will continue to go to Dr. Claiborne!I was in town visiting my mom and a friend and got a haircut for her birthday. It was the best haircut I've ever had. 

I was a little apprehensive but the staff was so friendly"

The front desk girl was very helpful and offered me a drink as soon as I walked in. I will definitely be back.I have been to this salon twice now and I am very pleased with both the services and the results. The first time I was there the owner did my nails and did a great job! The second time I went I was very disappointed. The manicure was sloppy and I had to file my nails down a little. I was charged $70 for a fill and a gel pedicure which is"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"This place came highly recommended to me by a friend who gets her eyebrows waxed and tinted by Kelly A. I typically get my eyebrows threaded, but wanted to try a tint and wax instead since it had been years since I did a wax and the tint was a new thing for me. I went to Heather Brown's downtown location and saw Kelly A. She is so kind, attentive, detail oriented, great personality and made me laugh throughout my appointment! I will say the tint didn't last as long as I would've liked (i have oily skin so that could've been factor), but the wax/shaping is THE BEST my eyebrows have ever looked!! I know they have tons of other services too, which I'm sure are just as amazing!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Have now been to Volume two times; both great cuts.  They started by offering me a beverage, and I had a really relaxing shampoo and condition. I needed a double shampoo because I'd led my hair get truly nasty, but they were kind and patient!  Next was a fantastic cut from Diana, who really listened to what I wanted (long layers, a bit of thinning) and made it happen. I also love that she offered me styling tips to replicate the blowout and wasn't pushy about products (though they gave me samples last time).  The cut and style were worth every penny as I received a lot of compliments and felt so much lighter afterward!  Their space is also very nice- big windows and great light!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Such a lovely salon.  Randomly found this place for an event for a group of four. They were very friendly on the phone and accommodating with our change of schedule. Everyone was so sweet and professional.  Most importantly I could tell they pride themselves in keeping the salon clean. This includes new plastic covers in the basin of each pedicure basin between customers and cleaning with 409.  The pricing was reasonable and they had great massage chairs accompanied with iPads for games.  A free massage is complimentary for all guests while you have your manicure.  Did I mention the candy!?  Yup not just some gross ten year old mints. They offer a huge selection of blow pops, twirlers etc.!  I highly recommend them:)"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,I got my nails done there and the girl was filing my nails excuse me not my nails the bitch was filing my skin. i was in so much PAIN i said owe you're hurting me and all she said was oh sorry. it got to the point where my fingers started bleeding. I asked for a matte top coat she put  a glossy coat on and buffed it with a file. Which was excrusiating because she keep filing my skin she would not stop. Everytime i wash my hands the water feels like acid burning my fingers. My fingers look like i just scraped them across the pavement. Getting your nails done is suppose to be relaxing not feel like your getting your skin shaved to the bone
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Great Dominican Hair Salon to go if you're in a bind and need your hair blown out without an appointment. Cheap too. About $35 for a typical wash, set, blow out, flat iron.

Know the rules: first come, first served. On Saturdays this means showing up 30 mins to an hour before the salon opens to get your name on the sign up sheet. Leave and come back when they open or bring something to do in your car.

If you want to get out quicker, skip the roller set. Some people show up with their hair already washed and just get their hair blown out. I don't know if it's cheaper, but it could save you time since you won't have to wait for the wash bowl (they only have two)."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Well, never again! I don't know what the hell happened. I will never ever go back to this place. If you want a nice, clean and friendly place to get a great cut, this is the place to go. 

I've been going to see Kim for almost 3 years and she's great! I've gotten 3 cuts and color and it always comes out great. I love my hair, it's not as long as I like it and it's very healthy. She's very friendly and takes her time. She's also very professional and she always does a great job. She always takes her time with my cut and"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I moved here about three years ago and was very disappointed. My first visit was a waste of time and money.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because it was one of the most expensive places I've ever been to.  I was charged $50 for a full set and a pedicure which is standard for my nails.  I paid $55 for a full set with a gel polish and a pedicure which is about $50.  I felt like they were rushing me out the door.  I understand that some people like that but they weren't too
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I moved to NOLA from Atlanta a year ago and was searching for a new stylist.  I came across this salon through the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.  The salon was beautiful and the staff was very friendly.  I had a great experience.  The decor is a bit too small, but it's a very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere.  I got a gel manicure and pedicure.  The service was great and the techs were very sweet.  I will be returning for sure.  I will definitely be back!  Thank you for a great experience and a beautiful manicure!

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Lacey gave me an AWESOME haircut. The salon is very clean and nice, and the staff is very friendly. I had a great experience. 

I'll be back in a few weeks. I'll be sure to try a few other services as well!I have had several massages from Kayla at Massage Envy in the past and have always had a great experience. I was in a pinch and had a great time. Kayla was a great masseuse and gave me a relaxing massage. I have been to a few spas and this was the first time that I went here and I will definitely be back!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,"I didn't have any problems with the service. I was happy with the massage and the atmosphere. The woman who did my pedi was very nice, but it was not that relaxing. I didn't get a massage, but it was nice and relaxing. They were a bit pricey for the service I received, but I will definitely be back. I love this place. It's so clean and the staff is super nice. I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails. They have a great selection of colors, and I always leave happy with my nails. I definitely recommend this place."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Hands down one of the best massages I've ever had. 

The massage therapists are knowledgeable and have the best bedside manner. The relaxation room is so relaxing and relaxing. 

You can't beat the price for a deep tissue massage. I recommend coming here for a couples massage.I love the way they do my nails and they always look so great. They are always professional and very accommodating. I go to Lily and she is a perfectionist and does an amazing job! She takes her time and is very meticulous. They also have a great selection of colors and are always very clean. I have been going here for"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I booked Nicolle to do my hair and makeup prior to my wedding last month.  She was incredibly easy to work with both leading up to and on the day of my wedding.  I could not have asked for a better experience.  She payed great attention to the look I wanted to achieve and executed it flawlessly.  She came to my hotel, even allowing for a last minute appointment time change when our wedding timeline was altered the day before.  She arrived on time and brought all the necessary tools of her trade with her.  I cannot say enough good things about the experience.  If ever I am ever in New Orleans again and needing to look fantastic she will be my first call!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Went for a beard trim there twice at their old location. 

Did a decent enough job. It's something I could've done myself and I prefer my own beard balm product which is organic whereas there's isn't. I was way into my beard at the time so I thought I should go to the professionals.

They offer a beer which is nice but not organic so I've declined it each time. The conversation was OK, nothing forced, just regular banter.

The pricing is a bit high for the work done in my opinion but I knew that going in. I don't know if I'd go back just because I like doing my beard trims myself and the quality of the products. I was jazzed when I left but overall, they're nothing too too special."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,I use to come here as a regular. But stopped after I had my last appointment made. I had called that day to let them know I was running late and then when I got there I find out my nail tech had gone home for the day. They didn't even have the decency to let me know I would be serviced by someone else when I made the call before my appointment. That was their golden opportunity. I was driving 30 minutes to come there after moving across town. This was the last straw after several times being made feel small and unimportant as a paying customer. They don't respect your time and see you as a dollar bill. Save your money for a place with a little more class.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Saw the NP for a rash on my face, and she prescribed a steroid that makes it go away, but it comes back immediately after I stop using it. They said not to use it more than 2 weeks, but then I have a rash on my face again that's worse than when it started! When I called to ask what I should do, they basically told me to deal with it. 

Randomly, the exact same thing just happened to my mom! Same NP, similar rash, same exact medicine, same ineffective results.

Luckily, I found a similar rash online and some folks recommended a natural skin cream. It has gone away quickly. I wish I had done that in the first place rather than spend the money and time at Brentwood Dermatology!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Tammy is the best! 

Ive been searching for the best nail girl in OV for a long long time! Well I've found her!! Tammy at itouch is your girl! Ive been to this place twice now and both times I've left so happy! Today i got a pedi and a dip powder mani! Loved how both turned out! She took her time, and made it so relaxing! Just what every girl needs when getting pampered. 
Tammy is also great with young girls. My daughter is 9 and Tammy was so patient and kind and made my sweet girl feel comfortable and special! Thanks Tammy! 

Look no more, Tammy is your nail girl! 

Also the atmosphere is fantastic, everyone is so nice, and this place is so pretty, and clean super clean!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Zen Nails and Spa is AMAZING! I look forward to my monthly appointment!! The staff is friendly and extremely helpful. I always get a dip manicure and it lasts a solid 3-4 weeks before I need to come back (I am extremely rough with my nails, too!) I see Alice for all my services and she is so kind and gentle!! They have several different pedicures to choose from that are relaxing and the massages are a DREAM. Zen's prices are spot on. 

Here is the best part... when you come in for a service, you get a punch card. After 10 visits, you get $25 off. The last nail salon I went to was only $5 off. For an avid nail person, that is so nice to have. 10/10 recommend."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I had to admit I was a little nervous about getting a Brazilian wax, but I was pleasantly surprised. The woman who did my waxing was very professional, and made me feel comfortable. I will definitely be back. I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was helped immediately and I was taken right away. I received a gel manicure and my nails look amazing! I was happy with my experience.

I don't know how I would go back if I was going to try it again.I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found it to be very frustrating to find a good nail salon in the area that is open on Sundays.

Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,"The owner has severe problems with customer service. She is rude and unprofessional. She does not care about customer satisfaction. The owner is a complete rip off.I'm a very picky person and had a great experience at Salon Nails. I had a gel manicure and pedicure. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The woman who did my nails was very nice. I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder massage. However, I will not be back. The manicure was sloppy and I had to file my nails myself to match the color I chose. There were a couple of spots where the polish was applied that were uneven."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Let me just say that this place is the best in Nashville. The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I have had a lot of bad experiences with other nail salons in the Nashville area. I have been to some of the other nail salons in the area and I have always been very satisfied with the quality of the services. They have a great selection of colors and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I have been coming here for years now and I have never had a bad experience. I have gotten dip powder and a pedicure and have never had a bad experience.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Came in for my 2nd time here and they were very nice. The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I got a gel manicure and it came out great. I came in for a gel manicure and they took me right away. I did get a free eyebrow wax while I was there which was a nice touch. I was happy with my experience and will definitely be returning for my next manicure! 

Update: I will post a picture for you to see!

Update: My nails are still perfect."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,She charges more than the price listed on the website. She tries to charge $70+ no matter what service you receive. I do love the way my nails look and I only want Chow or her husband to service my nails because I've gotten lackluster jobs from other techs. Unfortunately they do better than any other shop I've been to so I keep coming back to them. I try to go on weekdays when they're not extremely busy. Weekends you will have to wait because they are a popular shop. They squeeze your pockets for every penny they can get though. Almost like a shake down for money. It's a shame because they get plenty of business. Overall coming here will be bittersweet. You'll like your nails but you'll also be broke.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I Had the best experience here on Saturday. I noticed a girls hair on the subway months back and asked who does your hair and she said Vince I called Friday and he fit me in on Saturday. I was never  here before and Vince is a wizard with color. Had me in and out with a absolutely beautiful color and cut and Mae did a great job on my waxing. The shop is immaculately clean and lets get to the best part, even all the above wasn't good enough, the price. I asked her twice what did you say, and she laughed.
Thank you Vince and Mae. Two genuine professional and talented people. 

THEY HAVE A CLIENT FOR LIFE. BEST CHOICE I EVER MADE. PLEASE GO SEE THEM. THEY ARE PHENOMENAL.."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Sara deserves 5 stars plus!! She is amazing at what she does and I am so happy with her work. I met Sara through a co-worker of mine and had my lips done. She was so professional and calming as I was kind of nervous to be getting them done. She talked me through the entire process and for the most part it was pain free. She even checked up on me a couple times after the procedure to make sure all was well. I am obsessed with the results I received and no one even could tell I had gotten them done, they looked so natural. I will continue to see Sara for this service and would recommend her based on her knowledge and professionalism for all your skin care needs."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I absolutely adore the way Susan cuts my hair. I went to her on a whim when I first moved to St. Pete about two years ago. I had gotten an awful haircut in Boston that needed to be cleaned up badly. I have very thick, wavy-curly hair depending on the weather. It's usually frizzy and un-tamable, and most hairdressers only make it look worse with the cut. 

Susan has given me the best haircuts of my life--hands down. I don't know what I'll do if I ever move! She cuts it dry and leaves the front pieces just a little longer than the rest. I also like how Susan takes her time, and she is a pleasure to chat with while she works her magic. =) Prices are very reasonable too."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Worst pedicure experience ever. Shouldn't have even got 1 star but Yelp won't let me rate less than 1. When we first got there and sat down, they told me that $35 is the cheapest pedicure that I could get. It wasn't until after my pedicure that I saw their pricing menu and saw that the cheapest is actually $22. There are clumps of polish on our toes AND some toenails aren't even completely painted. Not to mention all they did was gossip in their own language the whole time we sat there and hardly paid any attention to what they were doing while they worked on us. 
We will absolutely NEVER return to this salon. Such a shame that they rip people off like that just because they're in the mall."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Beware! This place may give you the longest haircut of your life! I set an appointment for 1 pm and I didn't leave until 1:50 pm. I did come in for a beard trim and haircut so that might be why it took a bit longer.  The barbers here are extremely detail oriented.  I agree with another reviewer this place will likely give you the best haircut you've ever had. I was shocked when I saw the price only $25! I expected $40 considering he spent 45-50 minutes working on my hair and beard.

It is always stressful trusting someone new with your hair and worrying you may have to live with a bad haircut for awhile but if you're looking for a new barber, Heritage is the place to go."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"First things first, the shop is absolutely beautiful. The store is newly renovated and it's quite unique. They only do work on natural nails! The atmosphere is relaxed, clean, and very modernized unlike most salons that reek strong of chemical and acrylic. I usually do my own nails, but my experience here was a treat! Carol did an amazing job on my gel manicure/pedicure  and it came out flawless. The discounts are crazy good! They even informed me they'll be having groupon and livingsocial deals. They even have LOYALTY CARDS!!! Getting a 20 dollar gift certificate after 10 visits?! Too good to be true. 

I recommend this to girls who love their natural nails to come here and get work done. The only problem was what color of polish to choose!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I was skeptical at first, but I was very comfortable with the whole process. She was extremely thorough and explained every step of the process. 

I was so relaxed and it was worth the visit. I will be back!I absolutely love this salon! I have had several different people do my hair for years and I always leave feeling great! They are very talented stylists and make you feel very comfortable. I have seen them all do great work and are very friendly. They do a great job on my hair and make sure I am happy with it. They are also very reasonably priced! I am a hairstylist and it is hard to find"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"A family member bought me a gift certificate for Christmas. I called around 4:30pm and they said they could squeeze me in for a last minute appointment. I showed up at 5:15pm and they said they would be able to fit me in. I waited 30 minutes for the lady to finish up with another client and she finally had me sit down with a pedicure. I was getting a pedicure and it was only 45 minutes and a half later, she finished up with me. I'm not sure if I should have waited for her to finish up. When she finally got started, she had a client come in and was not only"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I couldn't stand my hair. She kept pulling it out of my hair, just the way she wanted. If you want a good hair cut, go to a professional hair salon. They are friendly and will cut your hair. I have been going to this salon for about 5 years. I have never had a bad experience. The salon is clean and has great music playing. I have tried a few salons in the area and have never been disappointed. I have gone to other salons but this one is the best. They are clean, professional and always have a great selection of colors."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,"Mimi's was ok. However I told her I wanted a simple design and she did not give me a full set. I had to get a fill and then the next day when I got home I saw a huge gap between my nails and my nails. This was my first time getting acrylics and I'm pretty sure I will not be going back. If you want your nails done right, do not go here. I used to go to Mimi's a few years ago. Now it's been years since I've been. I've never been disappointed. I never feel rushed or rushed. The staff is always friendly."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I am new to town and have been looking for a good nail salon for a while. I came across this place and I am so glad I did. I was very impressed by the customer service and the quality of work. I was greeted with a smile and was seated quickly. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was very friendly and I was very impressed with their service. I was happy to find a new place that I would go back to for my future pedicures. I will definitely be back. I recommend this place to everyone. I am looking forward to my next visit.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,Karen is an amazing artist. She gave me powder eyebrows and full lips. I chew my bottom lip as a nervous habit and had so much scar tissue there was absolutely no lip line there at all anymore. Karen actually made me a lip line! It looks amazing. She answered all of my questions and even gave me cookies. I'm going back on the 31st to get a touch up and I can't wait. For me this wasn't about making it easy to get ready in the morning it was because I can't wear makeup due to smells and the feel of it as I have medical conditions. Karen has helped me feel beautiful and womanly again. I highly recommend her for her work and as a person you can do no better.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Clean friendly environment. Am used to going to spas at hotel resorts which are exceptional, but this place answered the call. I had a 1000 appointment because I was catching a flight at 1300. They do not open until 10 but let me in early to shower and change. Dressing room was detailed clean. Fresh robes towels and sandals hanging ready to be used. Once out I made my way to massage room. Building has Nola feels through out. My masseuse came in, I had Jess, who was nothing but professional and could tell she has been doing it for a while. I got the hot stones and general massage for 80 minutes. So worth it. Softy waves crashing sounds good aroma put me in that spot it's hard to describe."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I have been to Bellagio many times.  It seems like each time I come the service gets worse. We were taken right back for our pedicures, but the non-English speaking ladies chatted the entire time in a language I could not understand.  That is extremely rude and akin to whispering right in front of people.  The lady who did my pedicure was quite rough with my feet, even after I told her at one point that her clipping was hurting me.  I know she spoke English because she spoke to me a couple of times.  The best thing about the experience was the cost.  $25 is inexpensive, but I guess you get what you pay for.  If I end up with an infection, I may sue."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"This spa was located inside the hotel California. It was enjoyable and the staff was amazing. My wife and I got couples massages, but our massages were done in different rooms. The only place where we could hang out and relax together before and after our appointments was in the waiting area which wasn't as relaxing as some places we have been. The had steam rooms located in both the men's and woman's locker rooms, and that was the only additional amenity they offer with your service. They have tea, fruit, and nuts while you wait. My wife forgot her curling iron and they let her take one back up to our room which she said was a life savor.  


Glad we did it but probably would not recommend for the price."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Exceptional service at a decent price. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the one time I went in the lady cut my hair and then the next time I went in she cut it shorter than I wanted. I'm not sure why she cut it shorter. She also made the other person's hair shorter than the one I got. I will not be going back. I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon. I have had both mani and pedis and they have been great. They also have a great selection of colors and are always very reasonably priced. I absolutely love my experience here.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I want to thank this salon for the great experience. I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I was seen within 5 minutes. The owner was very friendly and helpful. I sat down in the pedicure chair for about 10 minutes. She took her time and did a great job. I did get a hot stone massage on my legs and she was very nice. I will definitely be back.I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. I had a very nice experience. The nail tech did a great job, she was very personable and did a good job. She was very efficient and did a great job"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Prior to going to Adoro, I had an appointment. I arrived around 5:50pm and was immediately seen.  The front desk girl was very friendly and offered me a drink. The place was clean and quiet.  I was helped by the receptionist who was very friendly.  I was taken to my chair immediately and I was taken to the back by a very sweet young man who was doing my nails.  I was asked what color I wanted and when I got home, I noticed that my nail polish was completely missing. I asked if he could fix it and he said he could.  I thought that was odd because it was only a day"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I started coming here almost a year ago. It is a little pricier than the other salons in the area but the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is so relaxed and relaxing. I have had my nails done here a few times and I have never had a bad experience. I always get gel manicures and the ladies are always very thorough and precise with the designs I get. I always get a pedicure and it is always clean and neat. I always go to Angel Nails and I always get the gel manicure. I get my nails done here by the other techs and I am always satisfied. They also have a lot of great specials
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Very disappointed with the service here. The woman who did my nails did a sloppy job and the paint job was sloppy. The nails look terrible and the paint job was sloppy. I will not be going back. It was a waste of money.I have been to this salon twice now and I have to say I love the way they do my nails and pedicure. I love the way my nails look! I highly recommend it!I recently moved to the area and have been searching for a new salon for a good nail salon. I am very picky with who does my nails and I am very picky with my nails. I usually go to my regular
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This isn't your grandmother's massage.  If you're in need of a serious massage by an expert masseuse, this is the only place to go.  Mike is a master of his craft and it's apparent as soon as you walk in the door.  His knowledge is thorough, commanding and impressive.  He knows more about your anatomy than any massage therapist I've ever seen.  Hands down the best and most effective massage I've ever had.  It was like a great trip to the chiropractor combined with a complete stress-releasing massage.  I highly recommend the Active Isolated Stretching combined with a 90 minute massage.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact, it will blow your mind.  You won't ever want to leave.  Give it a try."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I went in for a balayage treatment. I researched for a few days before going over and knew the difference between ombre and balayage. The hairdresser told me that they were interchangeable and were basically the same. That is NOT true!  I asked for a subtle change in color, with the balayage treatment. I got: Ombre with extremely light hair at the bottom of my scalp, the lightening of my hair was not subtle. Now I have to wait and either let it grow a little more before cutting it again, or cut it shorter than I've ever had my hair. I'm very upset but glad that they refunded me my money. I will never go back to Mila's. It's unfortunate because I based my decision on the Yelp reviews and other websites."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"UPDATE: 3 weeks after my color it's already completely faded, even with using color safe sulfate free shampoo. Absolutely not worth the money I paid. 
Original: My experience was just ok. I liked that the stylist told me exactly how much the service that I wanted would cost before she started. She was really friendly and had great conversation. However, I had to go back to have the color adjusted because a whole section of my hair color didn't match the rest of the hair. I also ended up having to flatiron my hair myself when I got home because my roots were still really curly after she blow dried and flat ironed it (one of my pet peeves). For the cost (it's on the higher end) its definitely not my best hair service."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"THIS PLACE IS A SCAM!!!!

I purchased a Groupon for a mani-pedi to try this place out. I have been calling for months and they keep telling me they are booked solid weeks in advance. 6-7 weeks out which is as far as I can really schedule myself. When I told them my Groupon expired on the 20th, they said they could take me on the 21st, but only for the face value of my Groupon so I would have to pay the difference. 

The girl on the phone told me I was ""probably out of luck and would be better off getting a refund"" if I wasn't willing to pay more for the service. I was hoping to try this place out before spending the money, but now they will never have my business."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"The salon staff is extremely friendly, massage was long and felt incredible! Unfortunately the good stops there, the product was not high quality, my tech smushed one of my toes and did not fix it (I hate speaking up so didn't say anything, my own fault) my funny bunny manicure turned yellow within a few days which hasn't happened to me at other salons and the gel started to peel up on the sides before the end of the week. I'm no nail tech so I don't know the technical term but seems like they used a bit too much polish my nails just seemed bulkier not sleek and to top it off it was by far the most expensive manicure pedicure I've ever had! More expensive than a high end spa manicure pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I've gone to Bellissimo You are a professional with a lot of experience. I have been to multiple different stylists over the years and have always been pleased with the results. The staff is always friendly and professional. It's a very relaxing environment. I love how they do my nails. I always get compliments on my nails! I also love the fact that they are so clean!I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon. I have had both mani and pedis and they have been great. They also have a great selection of colors and are always very reasonably priced. I absolutely love this place.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Came to lavender foot spa and it was the best foot massage I've ever had! I got the deluxe pedicure and it was amazing! The atmosphere was so relaxed and relaxing. I will definitely be back!I'm a loyal customer for years and always get compliments on my nails. I always come here to get my nails done and I never have to wait long. They are very friendly and the nail technicians are very nice. The prices are reasonable and the quality of work is consistent. I would highly recommend going here.I've been here for about a year now and have always loved it. They have a great selection of colors and the staff is
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I use to come to this place when I lived in Nashville. The first time I went, I had a friend, who also works there and she had a very good experience. She had her nails done at a different place and she had her nails done there. The first time I went, I was going to get a full set and a pedicure. She told me she would be with me shortly. I asked if she could take me when I got home and she said yes. I told her I had a friend, which I was going to be in a rush to get my nails done, so I was a little apprehensive."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Tired of trekking to the Tampa area and thought I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. I am a former nail technician myself and have had a lot of bad experiences. I went in to get a gel manicure. My nail technician was very friendly and thorough. The woman who did my nails did a fantastic job. I was very happy with my nails. I will definitely be back!I used to love this place but after a few bad experiences, I decided to stop going. I went for a gel manicure and it was a great experience. However, today, I had a different technician do my manicure."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,So disappointed with how my hair turned out. I went in to get my hair cut and the girl who cut it had a bad attitude. I asked her if she could take it off and she said yes and she said yes. I came back for my haircut and she did not give me a mirror. I was also charged for the cut and $20 for the style. I will never go back here again. I paid $20 for a bad cut and a bad haircut. I have been to this salon about a dozen times. I love the service. They are always very friendly and always have a good time. The owners are very nice.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"So, i have been here a couple times and the experience has always been great. I get the powder dip powder nails and it lasts a solid 3 weeks! I have had a lot of powder dip powder manicures and they last a solid 3 weeks. This is my new go to place!I was looking for a place to get my nails done and this place came up so I decided to give it a try. I had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The place is very clean and the service was great. I will definitely be back!I just moved to Tucson from California and have been looking for a place to get my nails done."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I was introduced to Ava-Gaye through a college last year, when she was at another salon in Germantown... 2016, I was in this between stage with my hair. I am fond of very short pixie styles, and my first session with Ava was a success!!  I am not a every 2 week client, in fact some times I allow my hair to grow in, thick and full and I may not see her for 8-10 weeks. It doesn't matter the time span, Ava is pleasant and professional. She makes me feel like a valued client. I love the location, and the atmosphere of the salon is warm and peaceful............. I love Salon Mane. It's wonderful to see these lovely 'sistah's of Colour', establishing their mark in such a trendy, posh area of the city.........."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've gone to Heavenly Nails only one time before with a group of girls for a pedicure. We were in a hurry then, so I really didn't get a full experience. 
I was looking for a place to get into this weekend and saw them pop up again! Sally had plenty of great recommendations, so I scheduled with her! 
She was SO attentive! I tried dip for the first time, and let me tell you..if you've never done it- do it with Sally!!
She got me hot tea and did an amazing job on my pedicure. Even making sure to be sensitive after seeing my surgery scars on my feet. 
Yes the place is big, and I wouldn't recommend walking in. Make an appointment!! I went back almost immediately after walking in and picking my color"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Originally came in and showed the tech doing my nails the design I was interested in getting, after saying she could do this design it turned out very sloppy. I showed the receptionist, who was so kind and took off 25% of my total and offered to have me come back in to have the design fixed with a tech who is better at designs. After coming In I was given to a tech who still didn't know how to do the heart design and ended up replacing it with some stickers that took him about 5 minutes to apply and charged me $15. Honestly very disappointing experiences, they are not able to achieve the designs they claim in my opinion. I can really say the only nice thing about this place was their receptionist."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I went in on Monday a little after 3. There was no wait, and I was greeted immediately when I walked in. Cindy told me to have a seat at her station. I requested a fill with gel polish. I showed her the photo and she helped me find the colors. I did already have gel polish with glitter on my nails and it was SO PAINFUL for her to get it off. The drill was on high speed and she drilled so hard, drilling down to my actual nail. It took a few OUCH THAT HURTS and PLEASE DON'T to get her to use the file, BUT she eventually did, and apologized. After all was said and done I love my nails, and they look similar to the photo. For $40 I am pleased."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,Place was very clean and the people were mostly friendly. It was difficult to talk to my manicurist. He didn't make eye contact and wasn't all that inviting for conversation. Instead of talking he just tapped the hand he needed. Had to try 3 different bottles of polish before he found one that wouldn't clump when applied. There were multiple available chairs and there was nice music playing. Walk in or make an appointment. I made an appointment and was in right away. It seemed they kind of forgot about me at one point  after keeping me under the dryer for 3 rounds but otherwise it was good. Got exactly what I wanted and it only took about 40 minutes. Conveniently located next to some great food places which is a plus for afterward!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"The good.  Clean and quiet room.  Thats it. I was in a spa suite with a king bed and hot tub in room.  Unfortunately, the was a dinky claustrophobic room.  Bathroom was a closet size and the shower was very  very small.  After spending less money in the spa suites at the El Dorado and Silver Legacy, they were far bigger and better than this room at the Peppermill.  And I paid much less for those wonderful spa suite rooms. The bathrooms at the ElDorado and Silver Legacy suites were amazing.  Both with 2 sinks and huge stand up showers.  This ""suite"" was ridiculous.  I will not be returning to this hotel any time soon.  Not quite sure what I was paying for here."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Omg I am still in shock. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the owner is a very nice woman. I am upset that she is not there. She should've been there. I will not be back. I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was offered a beverage and I had a great experience. I will definitely be back!I went there to get a pedicure. The girl who did my pedicure was very nice and did a great job. She was very thorough and careful. I was able to walk in without an appointment and they had a wide selection of polish colors.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Melissa is my girl! I go to her every two weeks for a Brazilian wax, I get the full body wax every two weeks. She is also very knowledgeable and friendly. She is so nice to talk to and makes you feel comfortable. I've been going to see Kim for almost 3 years now. She is very friendly and professional. I had a horrible experience with a different stylist. I was very disappointed with the results. I went in for a cut and color and got a haircut for $50. I'm not sure if I'll be going back. I was just in a rush to get my hair done so I was very disappointed with the results."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Had a mani and pedi here. The woman who did my pedi did a very thorough job. I had a very nice experience, but the manicure was not so great. The polish was uneven and sloppy. I would not recommend this place.I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from this salon. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The lady who did my nails was very rough and cut me multiple times while massaging my legs. She kept saying, ""I don't need to worry about it"". I was shocked. I said, ""I don't want to go"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Horrible customer service. My mom and I came in to get pedicures for my daughter's birthday. We were told the wait would be 15 min but the wait was 30 min. We were told to wait in the chair. We sat for about 15 min and waited for 30 min. Then we were told to pay. I was very disappointed and told the lady I was unhappy with the service I was getting. She tried to tell me that they didn't have a good time for her to come back in another hour. I told her I was unhappy with my service and she just said that it was too late. We had to pay another customer for the service.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I came in after cutting my hair and the girl who did my hair did a terrible job. I had an appointment and the lady who did my hair seemed annoyed that I was there and that it was my fault. She cut me 3 times and I had to ask her to shape it the way I wanted it to. I told her I had to do it myself and she acted annoyed. I was charged $150 for a haircut and a haircut. I will never go back here again. I paid $80 for a cut and a haircut. I'm not mad at all.I'm a student here and have been to a few places in Tucson and this is the best.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I've been wanting to write this review, but I just don't think that's the way to go. I had a fabulous experience at this salon!  I had a very relaxing massage with Amanda and it was amazing. I will be back!  I highly recommend this salon!I was looking for a place to get my nails done and I came across this place on Yelp. I was very nervous about trying a new place and they did not disappoint. They took me right away and did a great job. The nail tech was very nice and did a great job! I'm a student so I am a student so I was a little apprehensive."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The worst and most rude salon you could go to. I had a appointment booked for a month to get my hair dyed, and the front desk lady rudely called me 15 minutes before my appointment and cancelled on. After I told her I needed my hair to be dyed by Friday and I work every day this week, that is why I made this appointment a month in advanced, she said sorry no one can do your hair today. Keep in mind I took off work to get my hair dyed just for me to not even get it. HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Their prices are too high, and have only heard bad things about this place. Thought I would try it out, but before I could already received horrible service. Hope someone shuts this establishment down."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"small place with not much for decor, but none of that really matters to me - all i care about is the quality of the cut for my wavy hair.  michele did a great job.  i gave it a 4 only because its shorter than i wanted, but it still has the shape that we talked about and i felt like she really listened to what i wanted in that department.

as another review said, they are gossipy (i forgot something and when i came back i basically caught them making fun to me) - but hey, we dont go to hair salons to make friends do we?  so im definitely going back!

plus - they text you the day before to confirm your appointment which is so much easier than the awkward confirmation calls."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Recently came into this salon for a fill and will definitely be back again! My tech was Tommy and he was fantastic. His work was clean and he took time to inspect every nail to be sure that he caught any minor chips/dents that even I might have missed. He was very helpful and especially patient when I was a little wishy-washy on what design I wanted on them and I left extremely satisfied. I didn't get a pedicure this time, but plan to soon because they looked amazing. All the equipment is in great shape (no wear and tear that I could tell) and everything was very clean. The overall atmosphere was super friendly and I could tell there were a lot of regulars in there. I look forward to calling myself one of them!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This was my first time here  on Wednesday. I called and was able to come in right away. I have been on the hunt for the best pedicure in philly, that's also reasonably priced, for months now. Needless to say, I think I've found the place! I chose the Spa Pedicure. I like my pedicures for the foot massages, maintenance, and experience. The foot massage was incredible , the service was done well, and my toes look nice. The only thing Is I don't think they got my heels quite as soft as I'd like them to be, but I think I it was to be careful not to scrape too far into my foot so I won't fault them for it. I am super excited about this place though, I will definitely be back"
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"Very POOR service and bad attitudes. I got my gel nails done this past Tuesday. It is now Saturday and they are already chipping. I went back in to get them fixed and the lady says $6 for 3 nails. I'm fine with that but since I'm paying, I asked how much is it fix them all since gel is all around my cuticles anyway. The lady with the bad attitude rudely says, I've never seen you before. $25! I only paid $20 to begin with so the idea that you're now playing games on prices for a POOR service that your store gave irritated. I will NEVER use this place again and I do not recommend anything other than training on better customer service and better nail services!!  Very POOR service and VERY RUDE!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I finally found a nail shop after 6 months of looking and living in Riverview for almost a year! This place is wonderful. I got there 2 minutes before it opened on a Sunday and there were already 4 people ahead of me so thats a good sign. The cleanliness and ambiance was perfect. The staff was very nice, professional and gentle. They use high end products and the spa chairs are very comfy with a lot of features. I ended up with a mani pedi combo but the price was different at checkout than what was on their services sheet. A bit overpriced in my opinion but great service overall. Lastly,  they offer a discount of $10 off when you get 10 stamps on your card.  I will definitely be a repeat customer."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Believe me when I say, this place is the best in Nashville. 

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. 

I have had a lot of bad experiences with other nail salons in the city, and I have never had a bad experience here. 

The only reason I gave them a 4-star review is because they're all very nice. 

If you're looking for a clean, modern salon, this is the place for you! 

I usually have a mani/pedi, but I usually have a gel manicure. 

I've never had any problems with the ped"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Made an appointment here two days in advance. I arrived at 2:30 and was immediately seen. The front desk girl told me that she was not sure how to take me. I waited in the waiting room for about 15 minutes and waited for my appointment. I was taken to a chair and waited for my appointment. I waited for about 30 minutes. I was surprised to see that there was an empty area. I waited for about 5 minutes for my appointment. I was given a tour of the room and was led to the room where my appointment was. I had a different lady doing my massage.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Honestly the first time I went to the salon, I was a little hesitant to go to the other stylist.  The second time I went, the stylist was great, but the third time I went, I got a horrible haircut.  My hair is still very short, but I was looking for a change to it, and had to go home and fix it myself.  I was quite surprised to see that there was an uneven cut.  It's very uneven, and it looks like I had a cut on my head.  I'm not going to be going back.  The other stylist seemed really friendly, but it was not as big of a deal"
Beauty & Spas,1.5,CG,"Worst manicure of my life. Not only did the girl try to fix it, she ruined my nails. I had to go to the salon to have them redone, and it was so bad that I had to go to a different salon to fix them. This is the worst nail salon I have ever been to. I will never go back. I have been to this location twice now. I was very disappointed with both times. The first time, I got a gel manicure. The manicurist did not put the nail polish on evenly, which I was happy with. However, my second time, the gel manicure was okay."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,May be the best massage I have ever had. I will definitely be going back!  The atmosphere is relaxing and the people are very friendly. I think the place is clean and it's well kept. I highly recommend this place. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut for $50. I left with a half assed cut and color. I was just in a rush to get out of there so I was trying to be kind of helpful.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"For Several years, I've been here a couple times and have never had a problem. I get the powder dip powder nails and it lasts a solid 3 weeks! I think the place is pretty nice and clean. It's in a small shopping center and it's very close to my house. I always get a great manicure and pedicure. I've had several different technicians and all have done a great job! I highly recommend this place. I've been a client of this salon for about 6 months now. I've been going here for years and I won't go anywhere else. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxing."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I went for a gel mani and pedi on 3/30. This was my 2nd time at the salon. Beautiful salon, mediocre services. The tech nipped my finger causing it to bleed while cutting my cuticles. I also left a pink stainless thermal cup and the staff was rude about me leaving it. I messaged them on 4/10 and on 4/11 they said they had it. When I went to pick it up on Sun, the person at the front desk did not know where it was and said she would call after hearing from their cleaning lady. Today I called back and was told it was thrown in the garbage after ""being here a month"" even though I was told Wed they had my cup. Rude people. Will not return. Sadly treating customers rudely cannot be remedied."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY!!
After losing my old hair stylist, I decided to look around for a new place to go. I called around and honestly wasnt pleased with receptionists and some stylist's attitude. When I called here, Elana answered and I told her I was picky about my layers, and needed help figuring out a new look. She was more than happy to help. I came in and loved the atmosphere. She was so sweet and worked with me. She took her time (instead of feeling like Im being rushed out so the stylist could fit as many appts as possible in a day) and explained what she was doing to my hair. Overall, I fell in love with my new look, my new stylist, and the place is convenient with tons of parking (always a plus)!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I'm not sure how I haven't reviewed the Studio yet! I have been getting my hair cut here for almost 3 years. I have super curly hair and it is difficult to find someone who actually knows how to work with curly hair. I met another curly girl and she recommended the Studio and specifically, Krystal. When I came in for the first time, my hair was in need of major TLC! It was a big chop for me after having long hair for years but needed to get my hair back to a healthy state. Krystal took the time to explain to me how to style my hair and really answer any questions I had. Krystal is an amazing stylist and person, I love my appointments and trust that she'll take great care of my hair!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been to Diamond Spa on several occasions, usually to get a massage by Robert, who by the way is a good masseuse. On my last visit, which was June 19, I got a Brazilian wax and a pedicure. Susan did my waxing and did a great job and was very quick. The pedicure was so so. The spa is pretty laid back and somewhat classy so don't look to get designs on your toes... The owner seemed to be a little rigid but I guess he makes up for it by giving the customers a fairly decent product. I will definately go back for a massage and waxing, not so sure about getting a pedicure. I like designs on my toes...hint hint owner of Diamond Spa. At least give your customers the option, it's our toes!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Where to begin with Dr Fry. He's an amazing guy and I wouldn't want anyone else doing my botox or lip filler. The first time I got my lips done was at another local office and I paid a ridiculous amount for something I wasn't satisfied with. A few weeks after I went to Dr Fry and he got me right. I've done them twice with him now and I absolutely love them and I get so many complaints. I definitely won't be going anywhere else. 

I am also a member so I get monthly facials with Michelle who is absolutely amazing. She is gentle and does an amazing job getting my skin just right. She very respectful and professional. 

I have recommend them to some of my friends and I would recommend them to anyone else!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My boyfriend always has his haircuts with a specific barber named Kevin and when the day for his appointment with Kevin came, that day we ended up being held back in class to finish up an essay we were given in class and we thought we couldn't make the appointment. So we called mustache cuts an hour ahead to tell them we couldn't make it and after 12 missed calls and 50 mins going by, they finally answered and it ended up being the owner Khalil not Kevin. We told him we're really sorry but something came up with school and we couldn't come, you'd think he would be professional but he starts cursing my boyfriend out over phone. Saying the F word and being extremely rude. 
 He made someone else lose clientele over his unprofessionalism."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Not impressed with this place. I paid $45 for a simple gel manicure and pedicure. The technician was very nice and the manicure was great. The pedicure was rushed and the paint job was terrible. I don't recommend this place. They do not have a huge selection of nail polish. They only have 3 technicians working. I went there with my sister and we were both very happy with the service and quality. The only reason I would give a 4 out of 5 is that the paint job was sloppy. I am not sure if they even have a color selection.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I have been to this location a couple times and have never had a problem. I have been to other locations in the area and have had good experiences. I have had great massages but this one was the worst. The massage was very rushed. My boyfriend got a deep tissue massage with no pressure. He was also disappointed. He was getting a deep tissue massage and was really disappointed. I was charged $70 for a deep tissue massage.I love this salon! I have been coming here for years now and I have never had a bad experience. I have gotten dip powder and a pedicure and have never had a bad experience. The salon is clean and the staff is very
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I've been going here for years. The only reason I've gone back is because I don't like the way they do nails. The girl that does my nails does a great job and does a good job. It's a little pricey for a manicure and pedicure but I would recommend it.I have been going to this place for over 3 years. I've had great experiences every time. This time I went for my first Brazilian wax. I was nervous because I'm from out of town, but I was so pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure what she was talking about but she was really good. She was very professional, friendly and kept my mind off of the"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I don't get my nails done often, but I decided to try this place for the first time. I had an appointment with Melissa, and she did a great job. She was super nice and talked me through everything. She took her time and was very thorough. I was very pleased with the results. I will definitely be back!I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job. The place is very clean and they have a huge selection of colors to choose from. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"After I felt safe being here, I thought it was a great place for a massage. 

The massage was amazing. The woman that did the massage was so great and made sure to make sure everything was perfect. I will definitely be coming back and will recommend it to everyone.I was looking for a place to get my nails done and I came across this place. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on my way back from work. I'm from out of town so I made the appointment. I showed up and was seen right away. My nail tech was Amy and she was so sweet and was super nice. She asked if I wanted a design"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,NEVER COMING BACK. I'm from out of town and needed a pedicure for my daughter's wedding. I read the reviews and decided to call and get an appointment. I was very pleased with the service and the facility. The staff was very friendly. My daughter got a gel manicure and a regular pedicure. I did not have an appointment and they took us right away. They did a great job! I highly recommend this place. I love this place! I go to Jessica for my nails and she is the best. I've never been disappointed with my nails! She always does a great job and is so precise with the work.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I am not a massage aficionado, but this is probably the first massage place I have returned to.

The prices are very reasonable. Much more so than ""big box"" places like Massage Envy. 

I have been getting massages more often this last year after being in a car accident then being diagnosed with spinal stenosis. There are some days I am in so much pain, I can't get away from my heating pad. 

I never have a problem getting in for a massage same day, and I always feel like a new person after. 

My husband and I now get massages about twice a month, when it used to be once a year, because we both consistently have great experiences. 

They also sell packages where you can buy 3 at a time to save, and $30 massages on Tuesdays."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Overall, my nails were pretty well done, but the guy that started my manicure was extremely RUDE!!  I am so glad that the lady took over bc there is no telling how they would have turned out if he did the entire job.  Im pretty sure the pic I showed him of how I wanted my nails done intimidated him bc he huffed and puffed when he saw it.  But back to the RUDENESS...  Im about 99% sure they were making fun of me and talking about me in their language, just bc, for someone that is in her mid 30s this is only the 2nd time Ive ever had acrylic nails, so I was asking questions about the process along the way.  All in all I will NEVER return to this place!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Jackie treated me like family and I am from Florida. I called her salon late on Saturday because i was in town due to a death in the family and the mass was Monday. I knew I had neglected my hair and the color was faded and grey roots were showing. The woman on the phone asked me to hold on so she could check. She said they were fully booked and closed on Sunday but Jackie the owner would open up just for me. She was there right on time and was so friendly she took my mind off of a very sad situation for an hour and did a single process color that was exactly what i wanted and my hair had incredible shine and texture. I will tell everyone I know about her.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I stopped in for a haircut recently, having called ahead saying I'd be there in about 20 minutes. I walked in, and the guy I had spoken to remembered me, and put me right in the chair (ahead of the guy who had walked in a minute before me, but who hadn't called - although they got to him right away anyway). So they definitely get points for that. My only disappointment was that rather than do a cut like I had previously, the barber went right for a basic comb over cut, but without asking me about what I wanted. So I take it this is pretty much a one-cut shop, there's not a lot of versatility in what they do and how they're trained. Not a bad haircut, mind you, but it's the basic cut only."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Dr. Winslow is a skilled surgeon who I have found to be trustworthy in guidance in choosing procedures. I'm very impressed with the results of services performed.  The staff is warm and compassionate from the front desk scheduling coordinator to the nurses and estheticians and even  Dr. Winslow herself. Even when I failed to follow some of the postoperative instructions they were understanding and just got me back on track rather than making me feel bad about it. I will use their services again in the future and highly recommend Dr. Winslow and Triste as well as the rest of the staff I've had the pleasure to be treated by so far. I look forward to their open houses - it's good opportunity to meet the staff & take advantage of special prices of various services.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I recently got a manicure here and my first experience wasn't ideal. I had to wait longer than it actually took for someone to do the manicure. I left with 2 of my nails having been filed slantedly and my manicure is already chipping. I got a gel manicure, which normally goes well for me since I am pretty tough on my nails. I can usually still get 3-4 weeks out of it and this time the polish started chipping after about a week. The whole experience was very rushed and I did not leave feeling like I had been pampered. I actually left a little frazzled because of how rushed the whole experience felt. I would not recommend this salon to anyone who is looking to relax or have a manicure that lasts more than a week."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,I stopped in on Thursday afternoon to get a pedicure.  The woman who did my pedicure was very nice.  She took her time and did a great job.  She was very thorough and did a great job on my manicure.  I will definitely be going back.  I was also impressed with the massage chairs.  They are very clean and the staff is very friendly.  I highly recommend this place.I love this place! I go to Jessica for my nails and she is the best. I've never been disappointed with my nails! She always does a great job and is so sweet! I've been going to her for over a year now and
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,If I can give zero stars I would. I went in for a simple gel manicure and the woman doing it had a bad attitude. I asked her if she could take it off and she said yes. It was clear she was annoyed and told me I had to pay for the gel and a man did my nails. I will never go back and I would not recommend this place. I paid for a simple manicure and it was only $35. It's very unprofessional and it's very expensive for what you get.I've been here for about a year now and have always loved it. They have a great selection of polish colors and they do a great job on my nails
Beauty & Spas,1.5,CG,"My spa pedicure was rushed. My nails were filed unevenly and she did not give a massage while drying. There was a lot of polish on my skin around my cuticles. I will not be going back. It was a waste of money.I have been to this salon twice now and I have to say I love the way it looks. The salon is clean and modern. They use a modern set of nail colors and the service is great. I have a hard time finding a salon that is comparable to my home, so I will definitely be back. 

However, the last time I went, I had a different tech, but the first tech was very rude"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I went in for a pedicure and the lady was rude and didn't even ask how I wanted my nails painted. I asked her to get the gel polish off and she did that. She was so rude and even said it was fine. I was charged $45 for the gel polish. I will never go back and will tell all my friends not to go here.I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon. I have had both mani and pedi and they have been very nice and professional. I recommend this salon to everyone.I have been here twice now and both times it was not great. The first time was ok
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Worst massage experience ever! I went in for a hour and a half for a medium to deep pressure massage. The therapist was awful! She was not warm and friendly like other staff at this location that was just to start she was more expensive because she is what they call a signature massage because she has more experience(3 years)??? Everytime I asked her to go deeper she would for maybe a minute literally.  Then she would go back to light pressure.  So I couldn't relax because all I could think was how awful it was that i couldnt believe this is what I was paying for. To top it off  the front desk woman were rude. I felt as if I was an  inconvenience to her. Never again will I waste my money here.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Cheri Swank is one of the most talented hair stylists I have ever had work on my fine, straight hair. With hair like this, every cut shows and Cheri's precise work is amazing. She takes the time to understand your hair, your lifestyle, and your hair fantasies. And then she figures out, with you, what really works. Yesterday I had a cut and partial highlights and floated out of there feeling like a brand new person. The best part was when my husband looked at me and said the new cut and color was ... wait for it ... STUPENDOUS! I beyond highly recommend Cheri and can say with confidence that your hair will never look better. Book your appointment as soon as you read this as Cheri is not only talented but popular. You will not be sorry!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I have gotten my nails done 3x at this salon. The lady who sits at the first station on the left has done them twice and she did a great job. I had no issues and could go almost 3 full weeks between fills. I went in last Saturday and she was not there so a man did them and they were AWFUL. He was very ruff and cut my cuticles with the drill to the point I have scabs. The paint job was spotty because he was rushing. (I think he wanted to go outside and smoke.) He shaped them weird and got acrylic all over my skin. It's been one week and all but 3 of my nails have lifted to the point they needed to be removed. My  nail beds hurt and I'm so disappointed.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I landed here after searching Yelp for the Best Shellac Manicure. I was pleasantly surprised. The salon is clean and has the largest selection of gel/shellac polishes in the Tampa Bay area. I decided on a shellac manicure and a standard pedicure. 

Tanya was awesome. She waited patiently while I chose a polish color and was careful not to nip me during the pedicure. I did share with her that I am diabetic. She shaped my fingernails just as I requested making sure that they were as even as possible. 

The only con is that the chairs are so close together and there is not much space between them and the manicure stations. On a crowded day, it can probably be overwhelming. 

I will definitely return. As with all salons I tend to go early in the work week."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I love love love this place. The owner is super nice and friendly. The salon is always clean and well maintained. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is so relaxed.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and always get a great experience. 

I recently started getting a gel manicure. The manicurist is very nice and I have never had a bad experience. She does a great job and I always get a beautiful gel manicure every time. 

I would recommend this place to anyone"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"My nails turned out fine, but the quality of work was not consistent. The polish was not applied evenly and the polish was applied unevenly.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I have been getting my hair done by the owner and I will never go anywhere else!  The owner is super friendly and the salon is beautiful and the atmosphere is so relaxed and relaxing. They offer complimentary drinks and even wine!  I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes and it's always a pleasure to go to a salon!  They are a little pricier but I always get the same quality and the service is on point. I have been going to Angel for over 10 years and I have NEVER had a bad experience!  

I have never had a bad experience here. I do recommend it to anyone looking for a new stylist."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This place was AMAZING! I had an appointment with Helen and she did a great job! I got a full set and the acrylic nails look amazing. The salon was clean and the staff was so friendly. I will definitely be back!I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was a walk-in, but I was not greeted at all. They told me to come back later in the day and that they could fix it. I came back later that day to get it fixed. The nail tech was very nice and did a good job. However, my nails started chipping within a day. The next day I went back to get them fixed"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,A few weeks ago I came in for a haircut. The color room was recommended to me by a customer at my job. I was very hesitant because my last cut over a year ago (at a different salon) did not turn out how I wanted at all. I came in pretty apprehensive but everyone was so welcoming and nice. I had Eric as a stylist. I showed him a few photos of haircuts on Pinterest that I liked. He did an absolutely amazing job. It's been over a month and I'm still getting compliments on my hair. Today one of my co-workers made comments about how much she loved it and that it even made me look younger. If you are looking for a great cut go to the color room and see Eric! You will not be disappointed.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"What a fantastic experience! I'm new to Philadelphia and have been looking for a new stylist which is always a challenge because a new stylist will usually take three appointments before they fully understand your hair, but this experience with Pawel, the owner of the shop, was incredible. His salon does ""dry cutting"" which means he can see what's happening to your hair while he's cutting it and so can you instead of it being cut when it's wet and you have no idea what it's going to look like once it's dry. Anyways, he cut it perfect on my first visit! Needless to say, I don't need to look for another stylist! The salon itself is really nice, everyone is really friendly and gracious, offering water, coffee or while while you're there. A terrific overall experience. Would highly recommend."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've been going to Diva Nails for a while now, and the last four visits have been disappointing!  I was told I'm a difficult customer. If you are going to pay alot of money for service and want your gel nails done a certain way, I don't think that's asking to much! When you give a tip and I tip very well, I never get a thank you from Tina.  It's like it's expected.  My peddy was terrible Tina was in a hurry.  And this last visit I called and they forgot I was coming and Tina told the owner no she didn't want to take me, so I saw someone else and my nails were not done well at all!!  Very upset!  I really liked this place and now I won't go back!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"You get what you pay for. Friends, if you are willing to pay for someone to get your nails in shape, do your self a favor and pay a little more and go to EarthSavers. I unfortunately had a last minute change of plans and had to get my mani/pedi today and EarthSavers (my usual) didn't have an available appointment. This place is walking distance from home and had decent reviews. But, I won't repeat. It's not relaxing when you have to micromanage what the nail technician is doing. I have 10 different finger nail shapes: Not. Uniformed. At. All = Butt. Ugly. Also, even getting the ""deluxe"" pedicure didn't get my feet in tip-top shape. What's so deluxe about mediocre polish application ? A bat can paint nails better. I should stick with what I know. Real tip: pass."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"My friend and I were in here to get a gel manicure and have her acrylic nails removed, and we had a terrible experience. Looking at the other Yelp reviews and I'm not sure if this was an anomaly, because other reviews seem good. However, the service was terrible. They had us move stations three times while our hands were soaking, which was awkward and frustrating. The stylist that did my manicure was very rude and aggressive. It felt like she was in a rush and was just trying to get it over with. The nails were not a smooth paint job and quality of work lacked. The entire process was very unorganized and my nails were more expensive than my usual place, where I get far better quality. 

I don't recommend this place and will not be going back."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Moved down here this past June. Had two bad experiences, one with a barber and another with a stylist. Yesterday, based on the 5 star rating I called and made an appt. and I am glad I did. Today I went and had my hair cut by Lindsay. She offered me a refreshment. I explained to her what happened to me in the past. She listened and took her time cutting my hair to my exact specifications. Lindsay is very professional, patient, friendly, with a sweet disposition. The other stylists are also very personable and friendly! They all seem to have a passion for what they do. The salon has a NYC industrial feel to it. Very modern with comfortable chairs. I will def go back. I highly recommend Lindsay! The owner should be very proud of her."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"This place is ridiculously overpriced. The quality of work is subpar, and the customer service is poor. I had a gel manicure and pedicure, and it was fine. I came in with a picture of what I wanted. I asked for a simple white gel manicure and a plain white with a nail color. The person who did it did a terrible job. They didn't put the nail polish on evenly and the polish didn't match at all. I'm not sure if I'll be going back, but I'll stick with my regular nail place.I have been here twice and have had good experiences both times. The first time I went to get a full set of acrylic"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"The worst customer service experice I have ever experienced. I was in a hurry and the person who was working on me had to leave, but they said they would call me back. I was so upset and embarrassed. I will never go back. I would not recommend this place to anyone.I was looking for a place to get my nails done and I came across this place on Yelp. I was very nervous about trying a new place and they did not disappoint. They took me right away and did a great job. The nail tech was very nice and did a great job! I'm so glad I found this place!I absolutely love my experience here. I have been coming here for years and"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I came here to get a fill and the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I had two nails that were crooked, and they're chipped after only a week. The place was clean and the girls were nice, but it's not worth the money.Great salon with great service. I have been going here for several years. I have never had a bad experience. I always get a pedicure and it is always clean. I always feel very comfortable. The prices are fair. I recommend going here.I've been here for about a year now.

Beauty & Spas,1.5,CG,Forever...hardly...I got gel nails done here and I am very pleased with how they turned out! I got a gel manicure and a regular pedicure and the gel polish was great. The massage chairs are comfy and the place is clean. I will definitely be back!The salon is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and professional. I had a mani/pedi and the owner did my nails. He was very nice and made sure my nails were perfect. I will be back!I had a great experience at this location. I got a Brazilian wax with Roxanne. She was super professional and knowledgeable. She really took the time to make sure my skin was
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! The only reason I gave this place a two star is because my nail tech was very nice and did a good job, but the manicure was not the best I've ever had. I went in with a friend and they were busy but I got seated quickly and got the gel manicure. They also didn't have a sign to the door to the back of the store saying that they had to take someone else's coat. It was very disappointing to see so many people come in after me for a manicure. I felt like they were rushing me out the door and rushing me out the door. I really do like my nails and they do not rush"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've been going to Dimple since I first moved to Philadelphia 4 years ago.  I was with her when she was only out in Center City and now that she's in the burbs, I make sure to only see her when I'm out here.  Truth is, she's the only person I trust with my eyebrows...she gets them right every single time.  

She's pleasant, professional, and her business is clean and welcoming.  

I'm a bit weary about too many people finding out she's out here because I'm way too comfortable with just dropping in.  But if her clientele balloons, she certainly deserves it.  

Her prices are comparable to what you'd find in other parts of this area. 

Helpful Tip:  She takes credit cards but you can't add tips on there so bring along some cash!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love it! Tried LeAnns couple years ago and thought it was nice nothing great but then I came back this year and it's been awesome! Great service, clean place, everyone is nice! The clientele is nice! All around great experience EDIT:  BEWARE I have been made aware they use cheap, dangerous acrylics called MMA, it's illegal and not good! But pay attention, strong smell in this salon & does not soak off with acetone as it should! They use drills a lot, another tale tale sign of using illegal products or simply just not being knowledgeable about how to care for nails properly. This place pinches pennies at every corner, I can't imagine what else they are doing in this place. If they are willing to use illegal products imagine what else could be going on behind the smiles."
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"I walked inside KT Nails at 7pm and when I walked in there was two customers inside being serviced. As I stood and waited to be greeted I noticed everyone mood change because I was coming in for service. I was asked what I needed and responded I would like a pedicure please, one guy spoke in a different language and was going back and fourth with another employee until the one guy said to me will you come back tomorrow because no one wants to service you now! Without an issue I walked out! Although I felt this was rude and unprofessional I didn't argue back I went and took my money elsewhere to be serviced! I will NEVER come here again and I WILL NOT recommend ever even if it's the last place and option open I WILL PASS!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Amazing spa!! Let me start out with it's the cleanest nail salon in the area you do not see any dust anywhere idk how they do it must be some kinda magic, also they offer you wine as soon as you walk in like your own fairy godmother who fills your every desire!! It's quiet and the ambience is so relaxing and chill! I can't even begin to describe how talented the nail techs are each one is skilled in all art forms (although Molly is my favorite but you can't have her) they all have such great talent and skill!! Also they offer many other girly things I haven't done yet (waxing and lashes obviously not at the same time) but will def try one day!! I 100% recommend this nail spa if you want to get treated like royalty!!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Convenient. That is the best way to describe this location, and why I keep coming back. The nail techs are all nice and will do whatever you like but you have to speak up. Gel manicures are very convenient, they have the UV light built in at every station. I've never had to wait they always get me right in. The one time they couldn't get me right in, they told me 30 min. I came back in exactly 30 min. and they were waiting for me. They have plenty of color options as well.

They can get you in and out for your eyebrows. My boyfriend and I both get ours done here. They do a good job for being in the mall. If you are sopping and want to get everything done in a day then definitely stop by here."

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I've being seeing Tina, the owner of the salon, for two years now, and I'm pretty sure she's the best! I've been going to her for about a year now and she's always done an excellent job. I've always had a great experience with Tina. She does a great job with my nails, and I always feel very comfortable and pampered. I also get gel manicures, and I love the way Tina does my nails! It's very easy to schedule appointments, and she always remembers me by name, and I'm always happy with the results. Tina is a perfectionist when it comes to my nails, and I can't imagine going anywhere else."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I don't recall exactly how much I liked the massage. I didn't feel like I was being pushed to buy products. The massage itself was good but the actual massage was great. The massage was good. It was a good value for the price.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut. I wanted to be a little more blonde, but I'm not sure what she was talking about. She told me to go with a different color, but I didn't want to get the color I asked for"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Back to get another pedi here. The woman who did my pedi did a very thorough job. I had a very nice experience, but the pedicure was not great. The massage was very good and the nail polish on my toes is uneven. I will not be returning.I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. They make you feel very welcome and comfortable. I love my nails and I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails and I will continue to go back.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"After a lot of research, I decided to try this place out. I have been to multiple nail salons in the area and this is by far the best one. The staff is so friendly and professional. The place is clean, they have a huge selection of gel colors and the decor is a bit outdated but I will definitely be back.I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found my go-to. I always feel very comfortable here and it is very clean. The staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable. I usually have a gel manicure but today I got a regular manicure and it was perfect! I am very happy with my nails"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I had never been to this Salon before, but since I was in the area I decided to go for gel polish on my nails and to get my eyebrows waxed. Right when I walked in I was greeted and it had such a cute design inside. Everything looked very clean and nice and I loved the color scheme. It seemed as if one gentleman in there was doing highlights on a customer. Another worker did my gel polish, and a third did my eyebrows later on. Each employee that I worked with was amazing. They also had a type of eyebrow waxing I had not done before where they do not use the fabric strips, rather the wax seemed to dry then she gently peeled it off with very minimal pain. I was very excited :-) I will definitely go back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Fishtown Nail Bar Cafe is quite possibly the loveliest  nail salon in the Northern Liberties area of Philadelphia. It is a small, clean, and charming spot which is set back on Frankford Ave. I'm always skeptical about trying a new location for beauty services, as it's really a roll of the dice, but Fishtown Nails Bar Cafe delivers an exquisite, full service experience. They play a nice selection of music which is both relaxing and current. While you get pampered by one of their friendly nail technicians you can enjoy coffee/tea or a nice glass of wine. I was shocked to find that their nail services even include a shoulder massage! If you're looking for a quality nail service (mani/pedi/gel/acrylic/dip) in a CLEAN environment (I cannot stress the importance of this enough) I strongly suggest checking out Fishtown Nails Bar Cafe."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"$10/month. Friendly staff. Cheap AF. Free weights. Squat racks. Machines. Treadmills. AC in summer. Heat in the winter. Showers. Bathrooms. Clean. Televisions. Occasionally hot chicks. Occasionally dudes that don't shower frequently enough. 

Knowledge is power!!! :

-Free weight dumbbells max at 60lbs
-Occasionally too many high schoolers crowded around a bench (gym etiquette)
-There is no where to do barbell bench EXCEPT a hack-squat rack (aka no free weight barbell bench)
-Super busy Mondays 6-8:30PM
-Pretty busy T-TH 6:00-8:30PM
-Pizza served first Monday of the month (not judging good or bad; I usually grab a slice)

For me, at $10/month cost it comes out to a quarter and a dime per gym session. That outweighs the cons for me. 

I'm rating 5 stars so that hopefully based on my review more hot chicks will come. (Sunglasses human head emoticon) 

It's really like a 3.5-4. (Awkward smiley teeth showing emoticon)"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I was gifted Lash extensions by my husband at Christmas after I purchased a full lash session with a refill so since the facility opened after COVID-19 intermission I have enjoyed 3 sessions of lash care by Kourtney and Courtney - completed with awesome front office staff, proper COVID-19 protocol, clean restroom facilities and cleansing regimen to start with a clean slate. The procedure was pain- free and comes with a comfortable treatment table, pillow bolster and a blanket. The nap was free and quite restful. So, what are you waiting for? You deserve this care for yourself! You have been so good during the shutdown. With everyone who cares about the health of the public, you sport your face mask everywhere and you can show off your amazing lashes and feel good about yourself. I did! And bought a membership too!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This doctor cannot be trusted! I went in with a concern about hair loss. Instead of having a conversation with me about my concerns to find what the problem could be, she ordered her PA to numb me so she could cut two plugs from my scalp. I expressed a concern with that since I was wanting a consultation and she said your insurance covers it, don't worry. Then when I came back to have the stitches removed she said your insurance also covers a full body scan as preventive every year. My insurance did not cover the full body scan and the biopsy she did revealed nothing. I'm $700 less than I was before coming to see her with no answers on my hair loss. Do not use this doctor. She doesn't care about her patients. She only cares about money."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Went in without an appointment and they were able to squeeze me in. My pedicure was done fast and well. The place is clean and the staff was friendly. The only thing that I didn't like was that they didn't do a manicure with the gel. The tech also didn't put the nail polish on evenly and I had to tell her to stop. I also didn't like that she didn't put the nail polish on evenly. Overall a good experience and will be going back!I've been going to this nail salon for years and it's never been a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and do a great job. They do a great job on my nails and are reasonably
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I LOVE Shelly's hair expertise. She is an expert in color and cut, and I have never felt so confident in her!  She takes her time to understand what you want and is so personable. She will listen to what you want and then she will give you the most thorough and thorough hair cut I have ever gotten. I would highly recommend her services. I will be back!I used to love coming here because it was closer to my home than where I live. I'm not sure if I'll be back. However, my last visit was yesterday. I had a gel manicure and it's already peeling."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I have been here a few times and the service is good. 

The first time I went, I had a gel manicure and pedicure. I was very pleased with the service and the price. However, the last time I went I got a gel manicure with gel polish. I was charged $50 for a gel manicure and pedicure which is standard for my nail salon. I paid $55 for a gel manicure and pedicure. The manicure was sloppy and I had to file my nails myself to match the color I chose. When I went to pay, they told me they didn't have the card. I was charged $50 for the gel manicure"

Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,"Horrible! 
I used to come here a couple years ago and I will never come back. I just moved here from NY and was worried about finding a new salon. I'm a very picky person and had no clue where to go. I had an appointment with Sara and she did an amazing job. She was very friendly and did a fantastic job. I had to wait a little bit but I was still very happy with my nails and the experience. I will definitely be returning for my next manicure!I've been going to this nail salon for years and it's never been a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and do a great job. They do a great job on my nails"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,i would never return to this nail salon! this place is  really dirty. My pedicure was really sad. My toes barely soaked and when i asked the lady to make it warmer she made it colder. That pedicure lasted 20 minutes at most. My pedicurist kept pulling at my toenail and i repeatedly told her that she was hurting me she wouldn't stop and now my big toe is hurting and has been since. The manicure was way worse. She barely let my fingers soak and she aggressively pulled at hangnails which hurt me. The nail polish was applied sloppily and started chipping the next day. That wouldn't even be considered a manicure. She didn't even put lotion on my hands and there was no hot towel. What a waste of 35$ and i would never recommend this place to a friend!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I was in desperate need of a cut and color and a friend recommended Verve because of the product they use and her past experience.

I came in to make and appointment for later in the day and was set up with Heather M. What a doll! She was very professional, gave good advice as well as her opinion without being pushy. I ended up with a cute new cute, great color, and hair that felt and looked so much healthier than when I came in.

I'd be happy to use this location as well as Heather as my permanent stylist. Awesome salon....days later my hair still looks and feels healthy! For those of us who are color happy and have to switch looks every few weeks, the Aveda product they use make this slightly less damaging and stressful on our hair. Love it ."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I had a first appointment here to establish care and it went incredibly smoothly. The only blip I experienced was that I placed a request online for them to contact me with an appointment and they never did, so I called 3 days later. However my appointment was on time, the provider was knowledgable and friendly, and I felt like my needs were heard. I will be signing up for the patient portal so that I can be involved in my care.

Also, as a new patient I got an appointment about 2 weeks out with an NP. If I want to see an MD/DO there is a bit of a wait, since I did not buy the membership package. However I do not have very complicated medical needs and I trusted the NP's care fully. I recommend coming here for a lovely experience!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Horrible service!  I will NEVER go there again and I don't recommend anyone go. Went in with my sister and niece both my sister and I got our nails done and my nice got a pedi, they left my nice soking in the pidi tub for 25 min! Ignored her until we brought it up after a walk in came in and they started her service as soon as she sat down! When I told the manager she told me it was because the adult pedi is more money and the girls fight over doing adult services verses kids I told her either way we pay for a service  then she started arguing saying they didn't skip her trying to back track what she said!! NEVER EVER WILL I GO BACK NOR WILL I EVER RECOMMED ANYONE GO HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I followed my hairdresser Kelly here after she moved from Luna salon. She honored the lower price she used to charge at her previous salon, which I really appreciated. I highly recommend her - she really knows hair. The first time I ever came in I had let my hair air dry after my shower the previous night. She noticed that it was slightly wavy, but not enough to really look good. She recommended thinning the ends of my hair to give it more volume/wave, and it worked! No hairdresser has ever recommended that; I really appreciated her thinking in depth about my hair type. She also didn't try to push products etc. I asked her what my hair needed and she said that since I don't dye it, any shampoo/conditioner above drugstore quality will work just fine and not dry it out."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I went to Margita at this place because she was recommended by a friend who just got a tattoo.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Fantastic salon!!!!  I found Headhouse through Groupon and went in for a cut and single process color.  The salon was easy to find and is in a beautiful space.  I had an appointment with Meighan and she did an amazing job!  My hair is curly and I'm very picky and nervous about where I get it cut, but Meighan was experienced and the cut came out great.  She helped get my hair back to brown (from red) and even had me stay for an extra glaze to make sure the color really changed...I appreciated how thorough she was!  She and the staff were friendly and helpful, and I never felt that awkwardness you sometimes have when getting your hair done.  Overall, I had a fantastic experience...so glad I found this salon - I will definitely be back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I can hear a very timid first time hair dye client and was pleasantly surprised by my results. Kevin  went over some pictures with me of balayage asking me what style I wanted. I wanted something that was pretty low maintenance and didn't require bleaching my hair because I didn't want to damage it too much. He picked a great shade, and while his staff did my hair he came by and checked the results himself as well. The only thing I will say that I did not get a head and neck massage, so that was a little disappointing. I also got a haircut which was accounted for separately in the charges. Overall an excellent price and you get a little styling at the end. I wish I had a before picture of my hair, but I'm very pleased With the result."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Stay away!  Don't waste your money and time!! You will leave feeling robbed, cheated and nails ruined

1. Day after my gel polish chipping off!!
2. They make up prices and you can't verify because they are not listed.
3. They talk about you in their language (unprofessional).
4. Charge for gel polish soak off when you're getting nails redone there. Most people don't charge if you're getting a repolish.
5. Had to get overlay on my thumb because the lady filed my nail too short.
6. My overlay and all the others coming out of there were too thick!
7. Polish all over my skin.
8. Painted thin you can see through polish.
9. Stayed in there from 4-6:20.
10. Other customers in there cursing loud and laughing. No crowd control
11. Filed my natural nails so thin I think they may break.
12. Heard another customer scream ... ""Stop my nail is burning"""
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I usually stay at The Grand Sierra.  It is where I taught my son to swim years ago, so I have been biased to that property.  However, with it under construction recently, and after they took the horse statues out of the Valet area, and began major construction, I decided to try the Peppermill by a friends suggestion.  The Operations Manager, David Fuller went above and beyond to make my stay unbelievably excellent.  We were met at the hotel and ""double"" upgraded to a Tuscany Balcony Suite at check-in.  Needless to say, it had a balcony.  Very cool!  The room upgrade started my trip off on a perfect note.  Thank you Peppermill!  I will be back.  My experience was better than expected thanks in part to the staff going the extra mile for us."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I can't comment on their rates all the time (minus a star), but, I did go for their final Friday the 13th event this weekend. I've been putting off getting inked because of finances. I'm only working partime and my fiance is in a rough spot until next year due to some roadbumps we've hit. While planning our day, we both remembered they did this and figured,""Why not?""since we have been planning tats for a while. Our anniversary is actually May 13, 2012.

After maybe a half hour or so wait which also included a very brief one after we did paperwork, we both have beautiful matching dice on our wrists representing fate, chance, and of course our date. (1+3) Forget our artist's name, but, he did a great job. The counter lady was also very professional. 

Would get work done here in the future."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"The massage was subpar and the interaction with the employees was awful. To begin with they tried to strong-arm me to upgrade to another package, which was frustrating. Then the lady announced that she was finished and left the room without giving me a chance to let her know she didn't put hot stones like my package included. Since I didn't get everything that I paid for I thought it would be ok to not include a tip. The employees told me to leave her a tip. I let her know I didn't get the hot stones and they said I could still tip her since she spent her time on giving me a massage. I told her I wouldn't tip because I'm paying for a service that wasn't completed so I think that's fair. They then yelled in a language I didn't understand."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"This place is so nice and has the best massage chairs I have ever had. I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the best massage I have ever had. I have had many massages and I am always pleased with the service. I recommend this place to anyone.I love this place! I've been getting my nails done by Anna for over 10 years and she always does a great job. I'm always nervous because I always feel very rushed. Anna is very friendly and makes sure I'm comfortable. I love that they have a parking lot in front of the building and have a parking lot right next to the salon. I love how they offer you a drink while you're there,"

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Raya is very nice and friendly. The only reason I'm giving her 4 stars is because she doesn't offer a drink. I will say that she does a great job of listening to what you want and making suggestions. However, she's also very sweet and friendly. If you have a concern about your hair or your hair, she will give you the best recommendation for how to care for your hair. This is not a salon that is on the same page with good products and service. 

I've been going to her for over a year now. She does a great job and has always done a great job. She's a great conversationalist and takes her time to make sure you are happy."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I could have gone to a more professional establishment, but I will not be going back. I am very disappointed. The woman that did my manicure was very rough and rough with my cuticles. She cut me 3 times and it was very painful. She also was rough with my cuticles. I will not be going back. I came here for the first time today for my first time with my sister. We were both very happy with the service and the quality of the nails we got. The nail techs were very nice and professional. I was able to walk in without an appointment and they had a wide selection of colors. They have a wide selection of dip colors and are reasonably priced."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"what can i say, the owner has the worst attitude. I will never come back here. Don't waste your time. The owner is a complete rip off. I'm a very picky person and had a great experience at Salon Nails. I had a gel manicure and pedicure. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The woman who did my nails was very nice. I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder massage. The pedicure was very good. The manicure was pretty good. The manicure was done fairly well and she did not paint my nails evenly. The man doing my pedicure was very nice and kept my feet clean. I'll be going back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Sarah Jonas has been doing my hair for the past few years. I won't let anyone else touch my hair. she always does a great job whether it be cut or color. one of the things i definitely admire about sarah is her honesty and true passion for what she does. she is not afraid to tell me no when it comes to doing something to my hair that will damage it. I always go back and forth on color and constantly want to dye or bleach it. i'm thankful that sarah is honest enough to tell me no, that my hair is not ready for it and will damage it. it lets me know that she's not just trying to get money from her clients but genuinely cares and takes pride in her work and the outcome for the client."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I'm a pretty low maintenance girl and don't do much to my hair, but I do want it to still look nice.  I came here after reading reviews and was a little worried since I never went to a hair salon without a reference.  
I had my hair cut by both Frances (the owner) and Sandy.  Both are EXTREMELY helpful and amazing.  I have given vague descriptions on what I wanted my hair to look like and they somehow manage to give me more than I was expecting.  I think it's worth mentioning I live about 1.5 hours away from Philly and willing to make the trip down to get my hair cut ONLY by this salon.
I took my two girlfriends here and they love the place as well!  For $18-$20 + tip, you really won't get much better."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,Today I decided to stop into Sarah Nail salon to get a pedicure for the first time. The Customer-service was horrible. I told the technician that she needed to scrubbed a little more. She only spent about 3min on the foot  scrub. My feet still felt  a little rough. I was told that I needed to pay more to have a special treatment. But the technician never put any effort into the 1st service. I spoke with the manager and she was not helpful. She did care to find out what was going on or how she could help. This salon had no other patrons at this time and it would not have been any inconvenience for them to do this service. Needless to say I will never go back again. And if anyone's looking for a salon I wouldn't recommend this place.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've found it!!  This is my salon for life!!  As someone who only gets two cuts per year, I make them count.  I've never had a bad experience or haircut here, no matter who I've gone to (even though I highly recommend Shanna B).  The scalp massage and parrafin wax treatments are complimentary and completely relax you as you get a quick and easy cut and style.  I've never paid more than $50, and that's pretty much my limit.  The products they use are great and they never pressure you into buying anything anyway.  I also have to add that if you come back within the first few weeks (maybe months) they'll ""crisp"" your hair for free.  Which basically means they'll trim it to make it look fresh again.  Great service especially if you're rocking bangs."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I am really very impressed with this salon.  Today was the first time I have ever been to J. Joseph Salon and Anastasia was my stylist.  I am so impressed with her knowledge, skill, attention to detail and her ability to carry on a great conversation!  The salon is very classy, clean and cozy.  The only little tiny disappointment I had was the price of the product I purchased.  I think I spent more on shampoo and conditioner than I did for my shampoo, cut and style.  It's not really a big deal; I could have said no, but I also like supporting local businesses and perhaps this particular brand will give me the results I'm looking for when I style my hair.  I'm looking forward to going back and seeing more magic from Anastasia!  Thank you!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I scheduled my liposuction months in advance. I was flying into Tampa from another state to see Dr. Su. I had already completed my blood work, paid my $2700 deposit, paid for airline tickets and hotel in advance. My husband had scheduled time off from work to acompany me to Tampa. Less than a month before my surgery I was contacted (emailed) by Dr. Su's staff. They informed me that Dr. Su had simply decided to go out of town the week of my surgery and I would need to reschedule my surgery for a later date.  I was shocked and disgusted. Unethical and disturbing to say the least. There is simply some people in this world who lack a moral compass. In the end, I feel that this was a blessing in disguise. There's no telling what I could have been subjected to."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I came here this week for a manicure and pedicure. The pedicure was great. The polish job was great, but the manicure was not so great. The polish job was terrible. It was clear that she was rushing. My nails look like they had been painted by a 2 year old. I did not get the full set of nails I wanted. She did not shape them properly and I had to go to another salon to have them fixed. I will not be going back here again.I've been going to this salon for about a year now.  My stylist, Lauren, is great, and my color is always great.  I've gotten a ton of compliments and even a few"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"From the very start, I asked for the design on my toes and she did not do it right. I asked for the design on my toes and she said she didn't have time to do it. I told her I wanted a design on my toes. I told her I would not want to get a design on my toes and she said ""I don't think you can do it. "" I was shocked. She tried to tell me that she didn't have time to do it. I was shocked that she didn't have time to do it, which I was not going to do. She went on and on. I said I didn't want it. She said ""it's ok""."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I recently moved to town and have been looking for a good nail salon for a while.  I came across this salon and I am so glad I did.  I was very impressed by the customer service and the quality of work.  I was greeted with a smile and asked what I needed.  I was offered a beverage and a glass of water while I was being serviced.  My technician, Amy, took her time and made sure I was happy with my nails.  She did a great job on my nails.  I will definitely be back!  Thank you Amy and the team at Oasis for making my nails perfect.  They do not rush.  I had my nails done and they look fabulous"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I went to Imagine Design and had the pleasure of meeting with Lynn. She did a great job. I had an appointment and I got right in. She was friendly and professional. I was able to get in quickly. I'm a loyal customer for life and will be back.I love this place. I have been going here for several years. I have never had a bad experience. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating. I go to Alyssa and she is very good at what she does. She takes her time and is very thorough. I'm very happy with my haircut and will continue to go to her for all my hair needs.I went in for a gel manicure and I was very pleased with the results
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Disappointed in the service I received. The woman who did my pedicure did a great job. I had a very nice experience, but the manicure was not so great.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and always get a great experience. 

I recently started getting a gel manicure. The manicurist is very nice and I have never had a bad experience. She does a great job and I always get a beautiful gel manicure. 

I have also had a pedicure here and it was well done"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was there for the 1st time a few days ago. I booked a haircut with Natalie L. After 2 pregnancies that were close together, I went in with long uncared for hair. I wanted to cut it off really short because of my frustrations with such long hair but a part of me wasn't ready to completely part with it. Natalie looked not only at my hair type but also the shape of my face and took in consideration how much time I wanted to spend on my hair everyday.  She made an excellent recommendation.  Cut it just below the shoulders in the front and a little shorter in the back. I LOVED it and still love it a few days later. Natalie is super knowledgeable and her experience really shows. So happy I found a hairstylist I want to go see again."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I found Modify on Yelp after reading a bunch of reviews of different places in my neighborhood, so it seemed only fitting to post a review now that I've been a few times.  I've gone to Gina for two cuts and two highlights, and she's done a great job every time. I have thick blonde hair and usually do a bob cut. The first time I went I showed her a few photos from Pinterest, and she really nailed it (keeping it a little longer in the front). The salon as a whole is reasonably priced, organized and runs on time, and Gina has been efficient (not one of those highlights that takes three hours, thank goodness!). I love the vibe in there as well- although I don't have crazy hair, they listen to their customers wishes and seem to do some really creative things."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"First off I have to say... one of the best cuts I've ever gotten! I'm new to Nashville and in need of a go-to barber. I was in Antioch today and after eating at a real cool spot, I was on the lookout for a haircut. As I jumped on Google I stumbled upon Hats Off, I saw all the pictures of the haircuts from here and told myself I HAVE to check this place out! As I walked in a met an awesome, down to earth, real woman (Shawna) let me tell you.. this girl got skillllllls! The cut was phenomenal, she was efficient, and conversation was so genuine and organic. The whole experience was on point! Shawna is definitely my new barber for all my cuts going forward. If you are looking for a barber you MUST come here and check this place out!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been a regular client here for over a year now (I can't believe I haven't written a review yet!) and I never go anywhere else. The high quality of service, attention to detail, and kind staff are why I continue to return. 

I recommend scheduling an appointment. While they do take walk-ins, the appointment is the way to go. That ensures they have the proper amount of staff on hand. I very rarely wait longer than 10 minutes. I have had a service from every staff member and I have absolutely no complaints. 

There is an array of polish, gel, and dip powders to choose from. The salon is always clean. And a beverage (soda, water or wine!) is offered during your service. 

The staff are consistently helpful in providing the best service for you and make recommendations for the health of your nails."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"After moving from Chicago to Tampa a year and a half ago...I have been bouncing around from Salon to Salon to find a good one. Finally...I have found a great salon with Serenity! Francisco did my color/highlights and cut. He is professional, easy to talk with, and very good at what he does. I told him what I wanted and he was quick to know actually how to get it done!  I was so at ease with him which was so refreshing.  I love my hair again! Thank you Francisco!!! I have had a lot of compliments on my hair as well! 

I also got my hair blow-out from Jose. He is also very professional, sweet, and very good with hair. You can tell Francisco and Jose love what they do for a living. You can't go wrong with either one of these Professionals."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,The people at J Arthur are amazing and the salon is very clean. I have been to many different salons in the area and have always been pleased with the results. The staff is very friendly and professional. It's a very relaxing environment. I would recommend J Arthur to anyone!I love this salon. I love the atmosphere and the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. They make you feel very welcome and comfortable. I love my nails and I always feel very comfortable. They do a great job on my nails. I will definitely be back.I got a gel mani and a pedicure. The technician was very nice and did a great job. I had a full set of acrylics and a gel manic
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I was recommended to check this place out by a friend of mine. I have been to the other places before but the service I received was beyond horrible. I got a gel manicure that started peeling in less than a week. The color was not what I wanted. The tech also cut my cuticles with the nail file and then had me sit on the dryer for another 10 minutes. When she was done, I noticed that she didn't buff my nails very well. She was very rough with my hands and they are very rough with my cuticles. I just wanted a polish change and she put a clear coat on top of it. I asked if she could just do a clear coat and she said yes."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,So today I impulsively decided to go and get a pedicure. I have a baby and wanted a pedicure. I am so glad I did. The place is very clean and everyone was very friendly. I got a gel manicure. My technician was excellent. She was thorough and did a great job. I will definitely be back!I came here for the first time today for my first time with my sister. We were both very happy with the service and the quality of the nails we got. The nail techs were very nice and professional. I was able to walk in without an appointment and they had a wide selection of colors. They have a wide selection of dip colors and are reasonably priced.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I am usually a huge fan of the fact that they are open on Sundays, but this one is a hidden gem. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. The only thing that I do not like is that they try to push you to buy packages for a facial which is also a nice touch. I have tried other places in the area and they are always so pushy. I just went there with my sister and it was great. I will definitely be returning for her services!I had a great experience with the staff, I loved my nail technician, she was very personable and did a great job on my nails! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!I had my first facial here and I will definitely"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"We came here on a recommendation from a friend and decided to try it out. I was not disappointed. The salon is cute and bright. The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is nice. They offer water and snacks. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The man who did my pedicure was very thorough. He did a great job and was very nice. I will definitely be back!I used to go to Mimi's a few years ago. Now it's been years since I've been here, and I'm not sure why. I usually go to a different salon but today I went back to get a gel manicure and pedicure. I had to wait at least 5 minutes to"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I scheduled an appointment with Cheyenne through Booksy for Hair Botox. I've heard great things about the treatment and was very excited to try it. As soon as I scheduled, I ended up getting bombarded by texts from Cheyenne. I thought it was odd since she just wanted to send me a Healthline link about the treatment. Then she messaged me pushing my appointment back 15 minutes. I thought fine it's a Saturday. Then as soon as I got to the salon and parked I received another text pushing my appointment back again for a men's hair cut!!! She's the most unprofessional and disorganized stylist I have ever dealt with! I canceled my appointment and told her to stop texting me. And she kept texting me!! She's so desperate for customers she adds them to her schedule without thinking of the next person! The worst customer service!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"The environment is ok, nothing special. I am not impressed with the pedi I got either. I was in the area for a couple of days and checked out the reviews for the area. This place had pretty good reviews, so I gave it a try. The lady who did my pedi could speak almost no English and I'm pretty good with understanding those who are English learners. She could understand nothing I said. I got one of the upper level/more expensive pedis and what I received was more like a basic pedi where I come from. No massage, no real scrub, nothing extra. The polish looks fine, but I had to ask for her to take the polish off of the skin. Not what I am used to. I guess next time I will make sure I get these things taken care of before leaving Texas."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I'm so happy the owners opened their own salon! It's in a great location next to Lulu's and Fresh Thyme. The salon is nice and well decorated, with fancy pedicure chairs. They take some getting used to as the massage can be a little intense, but once you figure out the settings they are really nice. I've gone to the nail tech for years at her previous salon and definitely think this is a step up. The owners are fabulous to work with, especially since I have a bad habit of ruining my big toe before we even get to nails... My last gel mani has lasted over two weeks while at the beach, pool, and doing dishes and unlike the prior review, my nails are quite strong. You can't beat the price, time and quality... and there is a tip line in case I forget cash!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,i have lived in the area for 25 years always went to great clips Brandon 1244 kings way never a bad experience until today. Patty chopped my hair and while doing so poked me in the eye with her scissors and  she said it was my fault because i didn't have my eyes closed.  Then ripped my finger nail with her comb  Again my fault she said I was holding my mask wrong. Oh I had to hold it so she didn't cut it off.  I left 20 dollars because this evil hearted person has my name and phone number.   My husband went bank and demanded the money back she actually threw it at him.   don't know how or why she got hired but after 25 years of patronizing great clips I am not going back to find out.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Great studio, amazing solution, and friendly owner. Megan had such a great attention to detail when spraying me and I knew she truly cared about giving me a quality experience. She was professional, yet friendly, and I enjoyed chatting with her throughout my spray tan. It was quick and easy and the tanning solution smelled AMAZING. It did transfer a bit to my clothes but came out later. She had me shower after 3 hours and I wish I had left it on closer to 5 because I didn't come out as dark as I had wanted to. To be fair, I understand why she gave me this recommendation because I came in VERY pasty. The tan lasted about 5 days and gave me an amazing golden glow. No orange, no streaks, no bad smell. It faded off evenly as well, which I loved."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Not very friendly or conversationalist-type. She kept saying she was sorry but she didn't seem to care. I had an appointment and I waited for 45 mins for a pedicure. The massage chair was comfy and the paint job was good. I would come back to see if I could get a mani or pedi. I would give them another shot but I will definitely not.I just went there to get a pedicure. The girl who did my pedicure was very nice and did a great job. She was very thorough and careful with everything. I was very pleased with the service. I definitely recommend this place.I've been going here for about a year now and I have never had
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Debbie is an amazing stylist!!!  She is an expert in color and cut, and I have never felt so confident in her skills.  She also takes the time to listen to what you want and make it happen.  She's a perfectionist.  I always look forward to her with my hair.  I highly recommend her!I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I don't usually go to spas, but I decided to try this place for the first time. I had an appointment with Melissa, and she was great! She took her time and made sure I was comfortable. She even gave me a sample of water and water to drink. I also love that they use a hot towel and are very sanitary. I will definitely be back. I will be back.Came here for my first Brazilian wax. I was nervous because I'm from out of town, but I was so pleasantly surprised.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I want to take time to say I am very pleased with my services! I got a full set done by Brie and I am very happy with the results. She is very meticulous and takes her time to make sure the work is done correctly. I will be back.Great salon with great service. I have been going here for several years. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. They offer a great selection of colors and the atmosphere is nice. I have a hard time finding a salon that is friendly and takes their time. I will definitely be back.This was my first time coming here and it was a great experience. They were super friendly and accommodating. The pedicure was good and I got the basic pedicure.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,I am surprised at the poor customer service. I went in for a simple gel manicure and was told that the woman didn't have a clue how to do a gel manicure. The young lady had no clue how to do a gel manicure. I asked for a gel manicure and a gel pedicure and was told that the woman did not have a clue how to do gel. I had to ask her to remove the gel and she did a sloppy job. The gel manicure is supposed to last at least 3 weeks. I am not sure why she just didn't get it right and that it would have been better if she had not done it. I am very disappointed and disappointed and will not be returning.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I made an appointment with some girl friends to get our nails done for a school function. We were all getting white dip nails which is hard to mess up. COVID precautions were not in place. There were far too many people in the salon and there was no social distancing. We still went in and got them done. Once they were done they looked okay. They were a little bumpy and uneven but not the worst I've gotten. After a week and a half they were already coming off. When I took the one on my thumb off, the fake nail was completely stuck to my nail and wasn't coming off. I had to have my dad cut the nail off the clump of glue that was stuck to my finger. After all the blood and trouble getting the nails off, I will not be going back."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I wish I read the bad reviews before coming in. All these 5 star ratings look fake or bought out. I got a full set done and the cuticles look horrible and plus he did 2 lousy coats so it looks uneven. My nails were kept long so I had to carefully put my hand in so it didn't touch the inside part and he gets impatient and jams it forward and ruins 2 nails and does a half ass job fixing it. The worst thing was that they painted my daughters nails with gel and it came off an hour later. I called the following morning and they agreed to fix it and when I showed up, the woman argued and mocked me in front of 10 customers and everyone was staring at me. She said I pay again or leave so I left. Waste of $65."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I need to find a new place near my job as I don't have time to drive around Tampa to get my nails done. But I am very picky about my nails and noticed the little things... That being said Joy was amazing! She knew exactly what I meant when I said I wanted stiletto nails but more of an almond shape, I like them pointy at the end. The parking was easy and as soon as I walked in it was very calming and relaxing which is just what I needed after a long day at work. It smells really good in there as well and I'm a very sweet sensory oriented person so it was relaxing. Everyone was so nice and helped me right away and joy was able to get my nails done in 45 minutes which is amazing because I was tired after work."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"My dad found this place after Covid, and was pleased with all the precautions the owner was taking so he decided to give it a try.  His first flat top was great and he made an appt to come back.  The second cut was far too short on the sides and he had to cancel his follow up and reschedule for a later date.  

When he showed up for his follow up, he was told that the barber refused to cut his hair and he could leave.  She does flat tops one way and if he doesn't want it done her way she was not cutting it.  

Extremely rude and condescending.  The owner needs to realize she is providing a service to others and they may not want what she thinks is best.  

He will be looking for a new barber."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"First my phone call to schedule an appointment.
My call was answered by a young lady named Tracy.
I just knew she was smiling as I explained the purpose of my appointment and when I was able to come.
Tracy was the consummate Pro.
Knowledgeable and friendly.
I arrived at the office and was greeted by a staff with purpose.
That purpose was to make me feel welcome and comfortable.
All the above was the icing on the cake.
And then I met Dr. Conover. The ""cake"" so to speak.
He was fantastic. He explained in easy to understand terms what my best course of action would be.
Offering me choices depending on my economic situation.
I felt confident I made the best choice in Noble Dental.
I had been with my previous dentist for about 20 years and he was special. So I was very apprehensive making a change.
But I nailed it with Dr. Conover and his incredible Staff!!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Same day appointment or last minute decision to get a celebrity sunless tanning can be impossible, but not with Kist by Mist.  Flor, the wife of the owner was able to squeezed me in.  I have to admit at first I was skeptical that this place has perfect 5 stars rating and most reviewed establishement compare to the other tanning salon.  Now I know why and as a customer, I am happy and satisfied with the service.  Although, my palms may look orangey  I think I have a nice consistent medium tan.  The place is equipped with disposal: thongs, hair bands, robes and lotions to maintain an all year round summer tan.  The staffs are friendly and professional.  Discounts are offer to UoA wildcats and military personnel.  Updates will follow on how my tan looks through out the week"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"There are two things I would say about the salon: 1) they offer a variety of services. 2) they are open until 8:30 and the shop is pretty busy. 3) they are open on Sundays.

I came in for a gel manicure and they took me right away. I was offered a beverage and a glass of wine while I was getting my nails done. My nails look amazing and I can't wait to go back!I have been here twice now and have had both my eyebrows waxed. Both times, they were great, but both times my eyebrows were not shaped well. I have had eyebrows waxed twice and both times, I had a different person do them and they both left my eyebrows uneven"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Queen Nails is the only nail salon I go to in Nashville. The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I have had a lot of bad experiences here and this is the first time I will ever go anywhere else. I also love the fact that they have the most beautiful nail polish colors and they are very clean! 

I will be back!I was in NOLA for a wedding and I needed a haircut and to get my hair trimmed. I had a really nice experience here. I was able to book a same day appointment with a different stylist and it was only $25 which was a steal. I'll definitely be back to see her."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I just moved here from Atlanta and I am very picky about who cuts my hair.  I have very fine, wavy, curly hair and have had a lot of bad haircuts.

The girl doing my nails was very friendly. She did a great job on my nails. She was very thorough and careful. I will definitely be coming back.I have been going to this location for a couple of years. I have had the pleasure of going to this location twice a year.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"If it's not the cars, it's the parking lot.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I wish they would have the Tuscany Tower Tower as a place to stay in the Tuscany Tower.I have been going to this salon for about 5 years.  I have never had a bad experience.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I always get a pedicure and it is always clean.  It's very convenient to have a spot in the back where the nail techs are working.  

However, the last time I went, I had a different tech, who was not as friendly as she had been.  I have never had a bad experience."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I had been here once a few years ago but stopped because they had a new lady that gave me a pedicure and had filed or trimmed a spot on my foot that hurt for weeks and niw in that area i slways get hard ski . However the place i was going they only have one or two people that do nails and they could not get to me for an hour and half....they asked me to come back or wait....no thanks and last time they didn't understand i wanted a pedicure too....anywho i was on a quest to find someone to do my nails....so i stopped here once again and was very pleased with my service....the atmosphere was nice, they had soft jazz playing and a guy done my nails, i loved them they look so nice and really natural,  i will definitely be going back"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"This is one of my favorite places in all of Tucson. I take all of my out of town visitors here. At just $35 for a one hour full body massage, you will feel wholly relaxed without breaking the bank. There are even cheaper options that are just as great. The place is very quiet with soothing music and the sound of water playing in the background. You start with your feet soaking in a warm bath while you get a head neck and shoulder massage. By the time the masseuse gets to your legs you will probably be in a deep slumber. As expected you can customize the pressure to your liking. They also really take the time to work out your knots. It's a great deal and I highly recommend it. They do take walk ins but I highly suggest you call ahead to secure an appointment."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"My husband went in for a hair cut and a beard trim yesterday and the results were a disaster. He normally goes to the Legends location, but due to moving this location was closer (he'll be making the drive next time). The manager was who gave him his hair cut and should probably go back to school; she didn't even bother to clean up the hairs around his neck and his beard is completely uneven. The hair cut looks nothing like what he asked for and is worse than before the cut. When he tried to talk to her, she blew him off and continued to talk to the other hair dressers instead. Due to her being the manager, we called the Legends location and made a complaint; the manager there has kindly offered to fix his hair and beard for free. He will not return to this location."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I decided to get serious about my skincare a couple months before my wedding and I am so glad I chose Fariba to work her magic on me!

Fariba knows what she is doing and was always available to answer my many many questions and concerns, so much valuable knowledge, I know how to better take care of my own unique skin! I also loved that we worked on a plan of action leading up to my big day together, deciding on variety of services including microneedling, facials, and dermaplaning. The combination and timing of these services led to me feeling and looking confident and beautiful for not only my wedding, but all the events leading up!

I know skincare services can be very pricey and it's easy to question whether it's worth the money, but in my opinion, the boost in confidence has been worth every penny! 

Thank you Fariba!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Visiting from Atlanta and my hair has been severely neglected. I asked some bartenders at my hotel bar where a good place to get my hair done was and this place was highly recommended. I called Tuesday morning and spoke to Nicolle who was amazing and sweet and scheduled me right away. I had an idea of what I wanted and she set me up with Jessica, who is absolutely amazing. I showed them some pictures, and I'm a few hours they turned my horrible mess of hair into red carpet beauty I'm in love!! (Better than any hair stylist I've had back home by far, shhh) they were both very attentive and personal, very sweet and funny! you get that special treatment feeling! Nicolle and Jessica worked together with me, went into details i cant understand about hair color and created a masterpiece!!! Beautiful place and beautiful people"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I'm new to Indianapolis (just a few blocks away) and I'm so happy I found this place. I've had the best experience with both Heather and the rest of the staff. I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and always get a great experience. I recently started getting a gel manicure and pedicure here. It's the best manicure I've ever had. The place is clean and relaxing. The staff is friendly and professional. The owners are very nice. They do a great job and I always feel welcome.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"BEST MASSAGE EVER!! 
 This is an amazing place to go for a massage!  I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the best massage I have ever had.  They are thorough and really know how to do it.  I highly recommend this place!I love this salon. They are the most professional, clean, and professional. I've had great experiences with my hair, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I've been to other salons before and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly, the products they use are great, and the products are always top notch. I have had some bad experiences with some of the salons in the past, but this salon has given"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I had a facial and brow wax and the experience was amazing. She was very thorough and thorough. I will be back! I will definitely be back!I have been a customer for years. They are friendly and efficient. I am always pleased with my service. I always get the gel mani. I have never had to wait long and have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my appointment. They have a lot of colors to choose from and a good selection of regular polish. All of the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this nail salon. They are clean and professional.I have been going to this location for a couple of years. I have had the pleasure of going to this location twice, once to get my hair"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"This review is for the actual tattoo, the girl who did it was really sweet and personable. I had an idea of what I wanted and she drew up a design that I wanted. She was super friendly and did a great job on it. I was very happy with the finished product and I will definitely be going back! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a great tattoo!This place is amazing! I was in town visiting my mom and a friend and got a haircut for her birthday. It's the perfect place to get a haircut for a little pampering. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I can't wait to come back!I had a fantastic experience at this salon."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"If I could give our experience less than one star, I would.  We ended up here based on the recommendation from the concierge at The Latham hotel. Finding the place was impossible on a weekend - no signs and The office building where the spa is located is locked on the weekends. The facilities were far from clean (glass of champagne that came with my treatment ended up being a cheap glass of Chardonnay in a glass still covered in someone else's lipstick and there were dirty sheets and towels in treatment rooms) and my friend told the facial ""expert"" that she was allergic to rose hips and then proceeded to be given a facial with rose hips - she broke out in a terrible immediate reaction.  Discount or something else to apologize for this error? Nope.  We really could not get out of here fast enough."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I got my nails done today by Mary. This was my second time here. She did a great job. The salon itself is nice and clean. You are greeted right away.  If you are getting a dip of any kind I highly recommend Mary. She was sweet and had good attention to detail.  I am very happy with my nails and will be returning here to get them done by her again.  

Just a side note.. the first time I came as a walk in because Mary was full for the day and I didn't want to wait another day.. the place was very accommodating but the dip ombré full set I got I wasn't happy with the work. It was ok but the ombré did blend at all... this is why I say request Mary. (Although I'm sure there are other techs that are good there)"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I love this place and have been a regularly here for over 2 years. This is a fantastic value for the price, Fantastic!

While they don't have the best and latest equipment, they have all the essentials. Really the only thing I would want from them is a free bar for swats and dead lifts (they only have the Smith Machine). 

But for $10 a month you get 24 hour access and free Pizza the first Monday of the month. That's an unbeatable proposition. Haha I was even showering here daily when my bathroom was being renovated. If your homeless or on the verge of homelessness, this is the last expense to cut!

My only real complaint is that they have FOX news as one of there channels on there T.Vs for people doing cardio. Don't they realize that the average age of the Fox news audience is 66? Change the channel!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I visited True Balance in St. Albert for the first time yesterday and I was very impressed. I'm a nurse so things like customer service and cleanliness are very important. Chelsea took care of me - she was professional, pleasant and knowledgeable. She washed her hands before the procedure and explained what she was doing. I had Botox and Juvederm (to my lips). The clinic is beautifully kept - Chelsea gave me a quick tour - clean, fresh and spacious. I'm very fussy about what I expect and I will certainly be recommending True Balance to friends and colleagues. The prices were what I expect to pay but they do a sliding scale for your Botox so it's cheaper if you use over a certain number of units. There was good printed information on after care and my follow-up appointment is booked. I'm giving True Balance a well-deserved five stars!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Sweet ladies but bad experience. Not worth the money. I've been going to this salon for years. I always have a great experience, and they're always very accommodating. The owner is very nice and accommodating. It's a very relaxing environment. I love the massages. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I go to Cindy and she's great. I've had great experiences with my nails, and I highly recommend it!I recently had an appointment with Lauren for a haircut and color. She is a very talented stylist and I am very happy with the results. I highly recommend Lauren and her team for all your hair needs. I went in for a gel manicure and I was very pleased with the results."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Just had a pedicure here, and it was the best pedicure I've ever had!  The owner was super friendly and did a great job with the manicure.  I will definitely go back.  It was a little pricey for the service but I will be back.I love love love this place! I've been going here for over 3 years now and they always do a great job. I get my nails done by Nyla and she always does a great job. I highly recommend this place. The nail techs are very professional and you get great service.I'm from out of town and needed a cut and color. I went in here to get a color change and I was told to pick my color."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,Haley has been doing my hair for the last 10 years. She is a master stylist. She always listens to my ideas and makes suggestions that are not to my liking. She is extremely personable and very professional. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a haircut. I will continue to go to her and recommend her to anyone!I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon. I have had both mani and pedis and they have been great. They also have a great selection of colors and are always very reasonably priced. I absolutely love my experience here. I have been coming here for years and I have never had a bad experience.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Just had the best massage of my life with Danielle. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same stylist for many years now and she always does an amazing job. She takes her time and is very precise. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and it's always a pleasure to see her. I have been going to this salon for years. I live in Philly and I travel a lot to get my hair cut. I have had my hair cut by Kevin, he is the best. I've never been disappointed. I never feel rushed or rushed. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is super friendly. They do a great job on my hair and I have never left disappointed."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Bad gel manicure, cuticles were not cleaned up. The gel is so thick in some places it makes my nail look bumpy. There is polish still on my cuticles and I have little bumps on my nails from something like dust getting on the wet polish that she didn't even bother trying to get out before putting the final top coat on. Looking at my manicure the next day I saw where there were air bubbles and still more polish stuck to the cuticle that I had to rub off. The annoying thing is, I know a girl that got a great manicure from Glitz so I was just stuck with someone not very personable and half-assing the entire thing(seriously, she was looking around at other places half the time she was doing my nails). I don't know if I even want to go back to have her fix it all."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Currently preparing for a stay here and I have to comment that the reviewers who are crying about how smoky it is need to grow up. 

Look, kids. It's a casino in Reno. It's gonna be smoky at times. I promise you won't hasten your death staying here. 

I've stayed here with ye auld wife a bunch of times. The spa rooms are tremendous. It's over the top in a good way. I've eaten at Oceano a million times (try the oysters during happy hour! Cheap and amazing!) and also enjoyed the Bimini Steakhouse a few times. No regrets. 

Seriously and with no sarcasm, this is by far the best place to stay in Reno. The food is great, the service is always up to par, and the rooms are ridiculously silly in the best way. Have some fun, keep your sense of humor intact, and you'll have a great stay."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"My nails are shorter on my left hand than my right and I'm sad because I had great expectations after recommendations to come here. I've never written a bad review and hope to not have to. The owner did charge me an additional $5 which it shows price list  for a gel full set it's only $40 (&up) however, I only got a full set with a black gel and like I stated one hand is complete shorter than the other and it's so frustrating. He also left paint on my hands which it's gel so I'm having to peel it off the sides weren't clean so when got home I have to file it off so it didn't look stubby. He was very dismissive of the people who came in trying to make appts didn't respond to them at all and no one else greeted or tried to assist."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Simply put, the HCG program at Tucson Medical Weight Loss WORKS! I lost 100 lbs in 5 months 2 years ago, have kept that off, now am back to lose the remaining 75 to hit my goal. Yes the diet is tough, but if you stick to the plan, you CANNOT fail. Being severely overweight my entire adult life, I kept hearing their ads on the radio, thought ""I'll try it for one month"", lost 25 lbs that month, and kept going. I took a second job to pay for it but it was best thing I could have done with that money, and it was for ME! I can now shop for clothes in regular stores, not limited to ordering from the ""big size"" online clothes stores! I have had ZERO unpleasant effects from the HCG program, in fact, I was able to cut my blood pressure med in half!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Ok first of all Kresta is an amazing artist! She is a true artist and I am so glad she opened her own studio. She is also very knowledgeable and passionate about what she does. She is extremely personable and very professional. I can't imagine going to anyone else now! I highly recommend Kresta to anyone who wants a great tattoo!I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the nail technicians are always happy to answer my questions! It's very clean and they do a great job on my nails. I will definitely be back for my next fill!I'm a student here and have been going here for years. I've been going here for about a year now and I have never had a bad experience.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I have been coming to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk. The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly. The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language. I have been going to this nail salon for over a year now and I am really happy with the service and the quality of the work. It is a very good place for a pedicure and manicure.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I went here yesterday, March 13th, with my sister for a massage and pedicure. The owner was super nice and I liked how they turned out. The place is very clean and everyone was very friendly. I will definitely be going back. I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous because I had a lot of high expectations. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The gentleman who did my nails was super sweet and did a great job! My toes look great and I will definitely be back. However, my gel manicure started peeling after a week. I don't know if that was due to the work that was done and the poor quality."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I sent an email to the owner and she responded saying she will not refund my money.  I will never return.  I will not be returning to this salon.  I will be taking my business elsewhere.  I am a loyal customer.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. However, when I got there, it was 11:30am, so I was seated immediately. I was asked what I wanted, and I told them I wanted a pedicure, but I wasn't expecting to get the basic pedicure. I was given a ""top coat"" to choose"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Hands down worst pedicure I've ever had.  My feet are still bleeding from being cut.  The woman doing my pedicure was so rough with the scrubbing tool that it made it bleed.  It was painful.  I was also told it was because my toes were not painted.  I will never go back.  I had to call the owner to complain and they told me I would have to pay $50 for the service.  I will never go back.I've been to this nail salon a couple times now and I'm not impressed with the service.  The service is really good.  The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I'll be going back.I got a gel manicure
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Absolutely one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a Barbershop. I went on a Saturday and the place was understandably packed (that's a good sign). I expected to wait so it wasn't an issue , the first thing I noticed is there's no sign in sheet so there's no way of knowing who got there when and what order people should be in. Me and my son take a seat people are walking in after us but being helped before us. My son tells me I think these guys are taking there friends first. After sitting for close to 45 minutes, I over hear the guy next to me say he has been waiting for 1.5 at that point we got up and left. These guys maybe gifted I will never know, because I will never go back there and I will tell everyone I know not to bother."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My experience with Dina was excellent. I took her beginners permanent makeup class that cost $5000. Dina has so much knowledge and experience that is extremely hard to find in New Orleans which I didn't realize until I started working in the field. I feel lucky I stumbled upon Dina, she still lets me train and ask for advice and continues to be a mentor to me in the industry. Do not just take anyone's class because it's cheap. If you're going to invest your money, invest it in someone who knows what they're doing and cares about your career. There are so many ""trainers"" who just want to take your money, and will ""help you"" to just take your knowledge. I feel like I really have a leg up on the industry because of what Dina has given me. I think her work and portfolio and client base speak for itself."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I normally go to the Massage Envy in Herndon, Virginia, but I happened to be in Wilmington for a golf weekend.  I have to say, I was immediately pleased when I walked in.  The front desk employees were really nice.  I felt pretty relaxed off the bat with their comfortable waiting room couch, waterfall, and glass of water (didn't even have to ask). My therapist Collette was really thorough asking what I needed.  My back and shoulders were killing me after 36 holes that weekend.  The session was really relaxing and Collette did an awesome job.  I left the massage without the headache that I walked in with, and my back was finally loose.  That woman is a miracle worker!   Overall it was a great experience.  I wish I lived in Wilmington, I would go to this Massage Envy after every round!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've been coming here for a year now. Never have I had a more consistent or better haircut. I come in once a month to see Sarah. She is far and away the best barber/stylist I have ever had. She is friendly and does an amazing job of not only listening to what I want but deciphering what I'm asking for and making it happen. I would drive farther and pay more just to have her cut my hair. 

The overall look & feel of the shop is awesome, receptionist are very friendly. Like most places now you get a drink while waiting, which is never long if you make an appointment. $35 for the haircut but includes a drink, hot shave on the back of your neck, shampoo, and style. That's on top of a very well done hair cut. Needless to say I'd give it 10 stars if I could."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Hannah is my usual nail lady and I have a lot of experience to share,  so I'll do this in bullet points. 

Positives:
-cheapest around, $25 for an acrylic fill and $40 for full set.  
- Good work for what you pay
- Fast

Negatives:
- She will sometimes overbook herself or be running late, there have been times where I waited an extra 45 minutes.
- One time she forgot I had an appointment and left to run errands, so theres that. 
- She sometimes will talk/facetime people while doing your nails, doesn't bother me but to those who want more if a professional environment it might bother you. 

Overall this place is just hannah and a few of her relatives so it's a small shop, but its cheapest around which is why I'm a regular. Tip: Book earlier in the day so theres not as big of a change you'll get pushed back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Unbeknownst to me, I had a gift certificate for a spa pedicure for my daughter and myself. We had an appointment and the lady at the front desk was not happy about it. We had to wait about 30 minutes to be taken back. I then called to ask if they had the massage chairs. They said yes and I had to wait. When we arrived at the front desk, I was told there was no room for us to go. I told them I would not be coming back to this salon for a massage. They offered us a complimentary wine or water. I was told that I had to wait. I said yes and it would be an hour. I waited for another 20 minutes until someone finally came in to get us."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I went to this nail salon because I was looking for a new salon for my nails.  I came across this salon through the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.  The place was clean and the staff was very friendly.  I got a gel manicure and regular pedicure.  They did a wonderful job on both.  They did a great job.  I was very pleased with the results.  The only reason I gave a 4 out of 5 is because they were very slow.  I had a mani and pedi, which is usually a good sign, but the woman who did my pedicure was not as thorough.  I was very disappointed that she was rushing, but I don't think she was rushing"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Phenomenal atmosphere and service. This is a great place to get a haircut. All of the stylists are very friendly and the prices are great. 

I have had great experiences with this place. I have been to many places in the area and this one is by far the best. 

The only reason I gave them a 4 is because it is a little pricier than other places in the area. I do not think they do a great job, but I will be going back to get my hair cut by Joe.I love this place! I have been here a few times, and have always had great service. However, the last time I went in for a full set of acrylics, I was charged $60"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I searched high and low for a good nail salon in Nashville. This is the first one I've found that actually cares about your money and takes the time to make sure you leave happy. I have been to many nail salons and this is one of the best ones I've been to. They have the most beautiful massage chairs and the staff is very friendly. They offer a great selection of colors and the atmosphere is very clean. I have been here twice and both times I felt very welcomed and they have a wide selection of nail polish colors. This is a great place and I will definitely be back!I love this place. I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Decent artwork, don't get me wrong. The guys are friendly, the place is clean, and the prices are very reasonable. The place is clean and the staff is friendly.

They do a great job and the staff is friendly."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I don't get it - the good rooms are fine but the bad rooms are awful (I know, I know - if you book using a third party it may not state the level of room you will get, but I booked using the Atlantis website a few times). Staff is fine - desk is nice and the rooms stay clean to the credit of housekeeping but I have tried all the restaurants (from the hot dog stand on the 2nd floor to the steakhouse) and they are all over priced and not that hot. A big upset was gambling at midnight and rubbernecking for a beer - when I asked the dealer to have a waitress come over he asked the pit boss who said ""they're not working right now"" - really a poor showing. I have stayed a few times at the Peppermill and would recommend them instead of this property."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,They are nice and welcoming. I came in to get a fitted night guard and brought my old one so they could get the same one I had. They gave me a different material and it fell apart over a couple nights. I went in again and they gave me another material that was not the same as my original one. It was so wrongly made it didn't look like my teeth at all. They remade the mold and gave me it. It lasted a couple months before cracking started to happen in the night guard and it moved my teeth and gave me a gap in my front teeth. Currently waiting for my appointment to see what can be done. I had braces for four years and wear my fitted night guard religiously to keep the results. Disappointed it's going to waste. And it's in the most noticeable part of my teeth.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I am giving 4 stars to this salon because this is a combined review for me and my daughter. They did a really good job on my daughter's hair but for me it was ok. Kevin himself is a really good stylist but he has his assistants do more of the coloring with his directions. One lady is very rough and she keeps pulling my hair, the other ladies are gentler. I might have given a lady that's still in training. The price is reasonable. They take their time to make sure clients get what they asked for. They even extended their stay to finish up my hair, past their closing time.  Make sure to check in on yelp and get a coupon for 10% off if it's your first visit. That saved me a lot.  I would recommend this salon to my friends, they are really good at Asian hair."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I write this review after recently moving from South Jersey to Philadelphia. Due to the relocation, I had the unenviable task of finding a closer location to tend to my hair. I have always held highly positive opinions of Studio 561. The salon is quite clean and chic, the service and hospitality are top-notch, and I have always entered and departed with a genuine smile on my face. These are great people!

The most important reason I frequented Studio 561 for more than two years was because I received the finest work from Colby. She is the best stylist I have ever encountered in my life!  Colby can always provide insight and stellar ideas while working magic on even the most complex of hair (I'm referring to myself). Clearly, I would recommend her to anybody and everybody!

I will miss the trips to Studio 561."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Came here with my mom today. They are similar to a lot of the foot spas in the Indy area. My lady was good at applying the right amount of pressure for my legs and feet.  It was really relaxing and I almost fell asleep.  But she was a little rough with my shoulder blades area. My right shoulder blade was a little sore after. They give you this tub of hot water to soak your feet in when you first get there. They didn't change the towel under my feet when it got damp after taking my feet out from the water, making my body temperature to lower slightly. Besides those two things I was really happy with my appointment. The price is incredible for the one hour foot massage too. Coming from the west coast, it's hard to believe that you can get an hour long massage for $25"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I've been a patron of this place for years and I've always left happy. I go every time I go.  The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is so relaxed.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had a lot of pedicures and manicures and my nails have never been bad. The pedicure was excellent and the hot stone massage was amazing. I would highly recommend this nail salon.I love this place! I have been here a few times, and have always had great service. However, today I went in to get a dip manicure and pedicure, and my nails were not shaped correctly."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Hmmm... salon is pretty and clean. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the owner is a bit rude. The front desk girl is very nice and welcoming. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the nail tech was very nice. I got a gel mani with tips. The nail tech was very rough and I had to tell her to stop so she could get it off. This was not a relaxing experience and I will not be back.I love this place! I've been going here for about a year now, and I won't go anywhere else.

I will definitely go back.I've been here a few times and have had a good experience. The staff is always friendly and the place is clean. I have had a lot of pedicures and they are good. I recommend making an appointment though because they are very busy. It's very convenient for me and I've never had a wait. The nail techs are very nice and are always nice. I've had a lot of different pedicure options and they always do a great job. The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because of the massage chairs."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I'm from Las Vegas and this place is the best in town. 

The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is calm. 

They have a huge selection of nail polish. They offer many options in the nail spa. There are many gel polishes. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I've been going there for years and I think they're all very good. 

The prices are great and they do a great job. I love that they do a lot of nail designs and they're all really nice. I've gotten dip manicures and pedicures and they always do a fantastic job. I've also gotten my pedicures done here and they do a great job. I've been going to this salon"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I LOOOOVE S&N... it's definitely the best nail salon I've been to. I come often for gel manicures (not because they don't last, but because I get annoyed when my nails get too long.) I've never once had a bad experience. 

The shop is clean and cute, they have a great selection of polishes (and always get the new colors!), and the girls are the best. 

Most of the time I come in and only have a vague idea of what I want, but I always leave loving my nails. Sometimes I just let them pick the color style, other times I show them a photo of what I'm thinking and they always end up looking good. 

Shout out to Nai for her awesome and creative nail art, but you can't go wrong with any of the other technicians, either. You also get a quick massage and free drinks -- it's just the best!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I don't usually write poor reviews but this massage was so bad that I had to write one so others do not end up paying for a massage that wasn't worth it. The front desk ladies were kind and friendly. I had my appointment with George who rubbed me down more than actually giving me a massage. He asked about pressure and I told him more pressure would be great, but it was still an hour of a rub down. This was the worst massage I've ever had. After he was done, he asked if I was a runner since I had knots in my legs. I was so annoyed that if I had knots how about you massage them out.
I'm sure he would be good for someone who likes little to no pressure. I was very disappointed. I'm sure there are better therapists there, but my experience wasn't a good one at all."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was just recently informed that I will be charged a fee to be paid before I can book my next appt with Barber Tray because I booked & missed 2 appts. I have not booked any appts with him in months. First of all me or my wife were satisfied with the last 2 services rendered. Second of all my appts were always switched last minute by phone for one excuse or another or a no show. Mainly excuses, excuses. I told him I will not have a fee applied because I have no intentions of returning I have been Satisfied with Barber Keno for the past few months. He was given a chance as my Barber at a few different shops in the City since he started out & his skills have surely fallen since then. So I'm done there. Should have gotten the young lady in chair #4."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I moved to PA years ago, but fearful for trying someone new, continued to travel to NYC to my hairdresser of many years. But with a special event imminent, and no time to get on a train, I chanced it on the reviews of fellow yelpers and tried BHD.

I called a week prior and got the appointment I wanted on a Sunday morning. I saw Kim. She artfully re-colored my box-dyed, multi-colored locks into a warm and natural, not goth black, dark brown.  She proceeded to cut my hair, taking time to ask me my style preferences, length preferences, understand what I liked and didn't like and care for the face framing to reduce facial features I was concerned about.  After 2 hours, I left like a million bucks! My hair is a breeze to style, and immediately got compliments as soon as I got to work! Thank you Kim and BHD! I will be back!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,I have been seeing Heather for a couple of years now.  She is a very personable and knowledgeable stylist.  I am always very happy with my hair when I leave.  She is extremely personable and very professional.  I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a haircut.  I highly recommend her.  I have had several cuts from her and she is always great.  I highly recommend her!I recently moved to the area and have been searching for a new salon for a good nail salon. I am very picky with who does my nails and I am very picky with my nails. I usually go to my regular nail salon but I had some bad experiences at this place. I went in for a gel manicure and

She was very sweet and did a great job. I will definitely be going back.I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous because I had a lot of high expectations.

The front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming. The spa is very clean and well kept. I will definitely be back!I have been to this salon twice now and I am very pleased with both the services and the results. The first time I was there the owner did my nails and did a great job! The second time I went I was very disappointed. The manicurist did not put the nail polish on evenly, which I was happy with. However, my nails are still very short, and the edges of my nails are not even. I am very disappointed with this service and will not be going back.I have been going to this"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,I'm giving this 4 stars because it's the only nail salon in town that I'll go to. I've had the best experience here. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. They offer complimentary drinks and even wine. The shop is clean and everyone is very friendly. I always get a gel manicure and it always lasts me over 3 weeks. I've also had a gel pedicure with Jasmine and it is always a great experience. I would recommend this place to anyone!I've been going to this nail salon for years and it's never been a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and do a great job. They do a great job on my nails and are reasonably priced. I also get dip powder and I've never had
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"If I could rate the color and cut separately, I would. And the color would get a 5. But the cut was very disappointing. I have fine thin hair which should never be razored or ""slithered"" with scissors. Point cutting is the only way to layer my hair. I expected Trim to know this. I didn't stop the stylist because I reserved judgement until two hours later when I got home a sure enough, the slithered hair looks like cotton candy. I reached out to the salon thru a private message and they offered to let her cut it again. Not! My hair will need to grow before I find another cutter. Normally, I spell this out when I go to a new stylist. I didn't this time because I thought Trim would know better. I was wrong and I'll have even more delicate fried-looking hair until it grows a bit. Please educate your stylists."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"If i could give any lower rating I would. It was a very disrespectful experience. I went around 7pm to get nails done. Only 3 people were working and there were 7 customers getting their mani/pedi done at same time which made it v weird. I patiently waited for an hour. By the time the person got ready for me, the owner directed her to another person who came after me saying she cannot do yours with no reason or rhyme. What was worse was she told me to wait rudely another half hour before anyone else is free. When I protested that why I have to wait hour and half when it was close to closing time she gave no reason or apologized. Other customers added to help me as everyone was waiting for long.

 Do yourself a favor and take your money somewhere else where you and your time are treated with respect."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This is an amazing place to take my son. We want to hollylocks and went to a  with a mans name and she butchered the angel hair that was once upon my kids head. I then hated his hair and cried for days. He didn't like it either and was really traumatizing but the whole experience since there was a rich of the buzzers on his head by accident when he turned and moved to look at me. Tabus was aware of his fear and they cured him of it and he is so handsome now and forever since this is the only place he will ever go to get his hair cut. They are so professional and kind, warming and welcoming and everyone compliments my sons hair! They did exactly what I wanted, to keep it a little long but manageable and beautiful and short for summer but still some length."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Tiffany, the manager, a young energetic and above all pleasant employee greeted and seated me for a scissor cut. For the first time in a long time I felt relaxed and enjoyed my short time  conversation with a very up-beat employee who was actually enjoying his profession which apparently runs in the family. I have been to this location for a long time in the past, but never was impressed with anyone who cut my hair. Another surprise for me was to find out that you can pre-register ahead of time
to cut the waiting time for your turn at the store. She's a keeper in my book, specially in an area where the qualified, experienced and pleasant employees are hard to find. This comes from someone who lost three managers for our business in New Port Richey last year! They all had paper qualifications but lacking personality and poise to deal with people. Feb."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"5 stars all around for this place and the girls. I will definitely be going back!I've been going to the same place for over a year now and have never had a bad experience. They are friendly and efficient. I've always had a great experience with Kim. She does a great job with my nails. I go to her and she's great with my eyebrows. She's very gentle and does a great job. I'm always very happy with my nails and I'm always happy with them. I'm going to continue going to this place for my nails!I had a great experience here! They were so accommodating and kind. I was not only happy with the results, but I also felt at ease and relaxed. I loved how they were able to answer questions"

She takes her time and is very precise. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and it's always a pleasure to see her.I have been going to Oggi for several years now and have never had a bad experience. The salon is very clean, very friendly, and the staff is very helpful. I usually have a mani/pedi, but I usually have a gel manicure. I have never had a bad experience here.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,This spa is wonderful!! The owner is so sweet and makes you feel so welcome. She does the best job on nails and facials. I have been coming here for a year now and I don't think I've ever been disappointed. I've been going to see Kim for almost 3 years now. She is very friendly and professional. I had a microdermabrasion and she did a great job! I highly recommend her!I recently moved to the area and have been searching for a new salon for a good nail salon. I am so glad I found this place. I had been looking for a new salon that does a decent job on my nails. I came across The Nail Spa and was immediately impressed by the level of service I received.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Terra is THE. BEST. Really. Not a professional. She is a professional. She is a personable human being. She is a true professional. I have had great results and results with many different services. She is a true professional. I have had 4 laser treatments and have been satisfied with the results. I will be back. I would recommend her to anyone. I just went there with my sister for my first treatment and I have a good experience. I highly recommend her. I will be back. I'm not sure why I'm giving this place a 3-star. I have been going here for over a year and I get the best haircuts I've ever had.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Very disappointed in this owners behavior. The owner is a liar and her staff is very rude and unprofessional. I had a gift certificate for a massage and was told to take it off because it was a gift certificate. I'm not sure why the owner was so rude. The manager also said it's because they have the gift certificate. I don't think I will be returning. I wish I would have known better.This place is great. I have been coming here for years and it is always clean and relaxing. The staff is very nice and welcoming. I never feel rushed or rushed. The pedicure is great and they have a lot of options for gel. They do a great job and the pedicures are amazing. I would recommend them to anyone!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Do not waste your money!I have been going to this nail salon for years. I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the best one. They do a great job and are friendly. I have been a loyal customer for years and always receive compliments on my nails. They do a great job and it's a very relaxing atmosphere. I have never had a bad experience here. This is my new nail place!I recently moved to the area and have been searching for a new salon for a good nail salon. I am so glad I found this place.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I usually only have good things to say about Buff Beauty Bar but today was different. I was scheduled for a wax with my usual person but I guess do to a computer glitch I was actually scheduled with Raine. I don't know if I caught her on a bad day but she was really unfriendly and made no effort to talk to me. Also every other place I have gone to will wax a few hairs I have right under my belly button at no extra cost but she said that it would be an extra $10. It literally would've taken an extra minute (if that) and was just a few hairs. I understand paying extra if I was getting my whole stomach waxed but geez $10 for a few pieces of hair?! I will go back but from now on I'll always make sure to call so I get scheduled with the correct person.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Had a wonderful experience here! The customer service is amazing. We checked in very late and everyone was extremely accommodating. The building is a bit older, but it was VERY clean. Also, the breakfast buffet was delicious. We ended up buying a few swimsuits at the gift shop for the kids and I was pleased that the prices were so good! The gift shop though reminded me of an airport gift shop. It could use an updated look with a better variety of products. It wasn't very exciting. Also the pool loungers are the old plastic kinds and if you lay on your belly on them, the metal edges hurt your ankles. They should update to some comfortable cushions. Lot's to do on the resort and a beautiful setting. Would have loved to try the spa, golf, biking, hiking, and meditation classes but we ran out if time. May give it another shot in the future."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,Most painful and longest manicure I've ever had. While everything seemed clean and nice especially with the high prices I had high expectations. They brought out the drill that they all shared (bits were shared as well) i should've left the second it started burning. My cuticles were cut down with the drill which I've never had done in my years of experience with acrylics and while they did that the skin around my nails was cut several times on both hands. I then watched as the same drill bit was used on another ladies hands and toes. My gel was bubbly and cuticles were inflamed after i left (and paid $40 for the service and no they do not offer refunds). I spent 2.5 hours there for a simple gel fill and will never be back or recommend. Save yourself time and money and go someplace with more experience. Would give 0 stars if possible!!
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Having experienced many massages over the years, Ryan's work is the most unique and altering I have ever found.  It seems to me like a structural massage which goes deeply where needed but also changes the inner and outer spatial awareness we have with our own bodies. I feel altered when I leave, as though taller, more aligned, more balanced, and in a whole new body.  It takes a few days to settle and integrate.  
At the same time, I am deeply relaxed, and the tightness and ways of holding my body for driving or using the mouse, are shifted into a better form.
I had a bad fall, tripping over a large boulder about a year ago and sought out different forms of help for that fall. Ryan's work erased it from my ribs, back, face, etc.  
Truly a master at what he does, I am so grateful to have found him."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I'd been going to Martina regularly for close to a year for color and haircut. Unfortunately after discussions of what I want and how I wanted her to proceed Martina unilaterally used different color product on my hair (which btw was more expensive) without advising me of the change until I finally caught on several months later When  i questioned the pricing. So instead of apologizing or trying to make it right made snarky comments about how it'll be on my head that my hair will look like a ""home job"" if she used the other Redken product. Here we had what I thought was an honest and straight forward communication on my hair, what I am looking for and how she will proceed, none of it was listened or adhered to. Dishonest, appears to dislike her job, takes shortcuts and is basically unprofessional. Incidentally this business offers discounts for positive Yelp reviews so beware."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"My friend got me a gift certificate for my birthday and the actually visit was fine!  Although, a little pricey if you ask me.

The problem came when a day later they called me and tried to tell me that the gift certificate my friend has purchased was not valid.  I called my friend and she checked into it.  The website says that gift certificates can be purchased online to use at this location. 

They called me back again two days in a row (I was unavailable the first time).
I answered and told them that I am definitely NOT coming in to reimburse any money.  They accepted my gift certificate and I paid the remaining balance in cash.  I told them that I thought it was very horrible business practice to try and call me for money AFTER accepting my gift certificate and that I would not be returning.

This place is shady."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I wrote a review for this place and thought it would be a nice place for a massage. I wasn't impressed. The front desk girl was very nice and welcoming. The massage was nice. The table was heated and the massage was good. I would come back again.Great haircut!  They take their time to do it right.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and you feel welcome.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,Sierra Smiles has wonderful staff and an amazing location. I will be going back!Very rude. I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. I was very unhappy with the service and the way my nails turned out. I asked for a gel manicure and was told no. I asked for a gel manicure and the woman said it would last 3 weeks. I didn't get a manicure and I am not sure if I will be back. I will not be going back. Best salon in the area. I've been going to Veronica for years. She is super friendly and takes her time. She's a perfectionist. She listens to what you want and does exactly that. They're also very professional and nice to be around.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,The front desk girl that greeted me was rude and condescending. She also did not ask how I wanted my nails shaped and I explained I wanted square nails and she said it was fine. She then proceeded to ask me if I wanted square nails. I said no I wanted square nails. She was very rude to me and did not tell me how much it would cost. I asked if I could get a nail file or file and she just did not want to do it. She then proceeded to talk to me in the language I was speaking to and I was so uncomfortable. She did not speak English and just continued to talk to me in the middle of my service. I did not appreciate her demeanor and the fact that she was rude and not personable.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This salon is worth the drive. The owner, Nancy, is very kind and the salon is very clean. I had a fabulous experience.  The staff was very nice and professional. The pedicure was excellent.  I will be back.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut. I wanted to be a little more blonde, but unfortunately my hair was not what I wanted. My stylist was very short with no direction and it was too short. I asked for a trim and I got a bob. I also got a color and I got a cut and color."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been consistently floating at Halcyon Floats in Northern Liberties for a few weeks and I feel like a whole new person. Aside from the serene environment, the owner and staff have created such a comfortable, welcoming space for an overall therapeutic experience. For someone who manages anxiety, I was fearful to float on days that my mind was racing, but what I've come to realize is that the privacy in my own room (yes, room, not pod. I love that you float in a large tub in a private room with a shower and space to gather yourself) has been monumental in attaining a meditative mindset for myself on the off days from floating. Also, I experience much more clarity and calm on days I have sessions. I literally crave the floating experience now!! I am so grateful for Halcyon Floats and their mission to help us all heal and recover both mentally and physically."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Where to start.. I have gone here a few times before and have never written a review, because I let my nails dry and then forgot about it. Lol!

On this visit, I got a gel mani and pedi. My nail specialist was Lan; she finished my feet really quickly, because as I'm only 20, it didn't need too much touching up. I asked for square round shaping, which she provided.  She massaged for a pretty long time, which I liked! 

Once, we finished my pedi  (I loved the way they came out), she helped me over to the mani station, where we started. We talked about a bunch of different things! I love how sociable she was; she was very sweet. :) In love with how my nails turned out, I usually get black/white nails and keep it simple, but decided to do something different for once!

Would definitely come back again and ask for Lan!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"My main complaint about this gym is about 90% of the yoga teachers. Lifetime has a wonderful yoga studio but in this gym they don't teach yoga. In the name of yoga they teach all kinds of nonsense. I don't mind surrender & flow class but the music is so loud! Their used to be roots now replaced by fire. What? No such thing and loudest music! This is not a nightclub! I joined specifically for the yoga. Other Lifetime gyms has many amenities like indoor and outdoor swimming pool besides that they have great authentic yoga teachers. Why do you play music that is so loud inappropriately. I can't believe am listening to Salt & pepper, Rap etc. while am trying to listen to my breath. Cmon be real ... don't cheat the students that they are learning yoga they are not!!! Also please repair the TV monitors on the stair master! It's been over 2

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My hairstylist is Tim at Hollywood Style. I lived for many years in Center City Philadelphia where they are supposedly more fashionable, but Tim is better than many of the hairstylists I had downtown. He listens, he gives me a cut that flatters my round face shape (not some random hairstyle from a celebrity with a thin face, like I so often got downtown,) and he is on top of the latest trends. He told me he thinks about my hairstyle while he is not at work, and tries to see if there's anything he can do to keep me more fashionable and elegant -- a must since I'm in a glamour business as one of Philadelphia's top wedding photographer. I have looked better, made a better impression on my clients, and even gotten more compliments from my husband since I started going to Tim for my hair. I would highly, highly recommend Tim and Hollywood Style."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  The owner/manager was a very nice gentleman who greeted me warmly as soon as I walked in.  Unfortunately, although the lady who actually did my pedicure was very sweet,I was not pleased with the job she did on my feet.  She clipped most crooked and also barely filed them down which left me with a bunch of ill shaped nails. So I have to go home and file them correctly.  Kinda defeats the purpose of spending $45 for a pedicure.  However, she did do a good job scrubbing my feet.  I would not return or recommend this shop based on my experience but it seems some of the other techs were doing a great job on other customers who seemed pleased. The only otter downside is they don't have feet nail dryers ... Just a little fan they sit next to your feet when done :("
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I gave a 5-star rating because of the fact that they're open on Sundays, which is awesome.

I will probably be going back to try something else next time.I have been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon.

I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder and shoulder massage. I also got a pedicure. My toes were very dry. I loved that they use a dry dryer to dry your feet and massage your feet.

Beauty & Spas,1.0,CG,"I had my one and only tattoo by Troy and it was a great experience. I was nervous to get a tattoo but Troy made me feel very comfortable and was very nice. I will definitely be going back to him in the future. I had an amazing experience here! I had a mani/pedi with Helen and it was by far the best experience I have had! She made me feel comfortable and was very personable! The only reason I gave a star is because I don't like to get my nails done often. I felt like they were rushed, not focused on my nails or feet and just wanted to get out of there. But I went here to get a dip manicure and it looks amazing! The salon is very clean and the staff are very friendly."

I don't think I'll ever go back. I'm not a fan of the owner, but I hope they improve their customer service. They're just doing a bad job. 

I don't like that I have to have to wait to get my hair done, but I will let my hair grow out. They just need to learn how to do a better job. They'll be honest and not talk about what you're looking for.I have been to a few different nail salons in the area and I have finally"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I went to Verve for years!! This past January, my regular stylist seemed to be having an ""off day"" or basically just had a mental breakdown while doing my hair. I left on verge of tears. My hair was completely butchered and she put so much ""texture"" at the ends my hair looked unhealthy. It was also MAJORLY crooked. Color was made brassy yellow. My 10 year old daughter asked if the stylist was mad at me. GREAT question, honey!! I went back and another stylist tried to fix the damage, but without going a lot shorter, there wasnt much that could be done. I have been growing my hair out now for 6 months, scared to have anyone touch it! I finally couldn't take it anymore and had my hair done at Circa 79 down the road. They did a FABULOUS job with my color.. and just trimmed it up to try and get it straight again."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I've been going to Jenn for several years now for variety of services, including eyebrow waxing and facials.  She is located in an adorable Salon in Loomis. She is always adding new services and techniques too, more recently light therapy.  I've gone for 3 red light therapy sessions and already notice a difference in my skin. I can't wait for my 4th session to see the before and after pics!  I also follow her on IG and Facebook and love seeing all of her makeup pictures of brides etc. She also told me about a makeup application session she did for a tween girl wanting to learn how to wear makeup. I will definitely take my daughter for a lesson when she's ready! Nothing worse then a young girl looking like clown!  Jenn has a lot to offer, and I'm happy I have her to help me take care of my skin care needs!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Went here because they are open extra late until 7:30 and it was 6:30 and wanted a gel pedicure. Worst experience ever! Ever! Do not go! I should have walked out from the vibe I got, and things got worse. 
So, the guy doing my gel pedicure never soaks my gel off. He uses an electronic file to sand all of it off. Horrible for your nails! I felt completely rushed and he had an hour. He hurt me numerous times while doing my cuticles and cut me so badly that I screamed in pain and other customers looked. He continued to be rough. I really wanted to get up and leave. I don't even know if anything is sterilized there the place is so filthy which has me freaked out. stay away! It's horrible! 
Go to Tre nail bar or Cinderella nails. This place is filthy and they could care less about the service they provide you."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have a friend that has the most gorgeous lashes and she referred me to Wink Nashville. While I didn't have an appointment with the girl she usually sees, I went to Ashley M. for a super early appointment before work one day. I wasn't so sure about that early of an appointment, but I just had to lay there and relax so the hard part was not my responsibility. :) It's now almost 3 weeks later and my lashes still look pretty darn good. I go for my first fill in two days and hope to have the same great experience. 

For someone that has very thin and very short eyelashes that used to fall out due to eye allergies and sensitivities, I am thrilled with the application experience, durability and longevity of the lashes to ""stay put"" and create a natural awake look that allows me to wear less makeup daily.

The girl who did my pedicure was very rough and rough. I was so upset. I told her I was going to just get a polish change, but she continued to massage my legs and feet.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,this place was clean and nice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the massage was a little too painful. I will not be returning. I have been a customer for years. They are friendly and efficient. I am always pleased with my service. I always get the gel mani. I have never had to wait long and have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my appointment. They have a lot of colors to choose from and a good selection of regular polish. All of the nail techs are great. I love that they have a parking lot in front of the building and have a parking lot next to it. I can't wait to return for another manicure. I'm new to the area and was looking for a new salon.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I went in to get acrylics for the first time at Happy Foot. The experience was great, I did a walk-in and they took me in right away. The person who took care of me was really nice and patient with me. However, right after the service, I noticed that two of my nails were filed down to two different lengths. And one of my acrylics is crooked. Four days of having acrylics on, there is a small chip on the side of the acrylic. I showed my nail tech a picture of what I wanted and they did try. The thing is I asked to have a design on my ring finger of both hands, but both look super thick. I have really bad OCD when it comes to making sure everything is even. Overall, my experience was okay. The customer service was great, but I just wish that things could go different the time I was there."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"One star only because i can't do less.  Their customer service is terrible.  I went online to request an appointment.   I never received a phone call to set up the appointment.   I called to set up appointment and was told someone called and left a message (which I checked my phone records and did not receive a call).  On my request I asked for a deep tissue 2 hour massage I only got a massage for 45 minutes (not deep tissue) and was charged for an hour massage.  If it's only going to be 45 minutes, then please disclose that and not make it sound like you are getting more than you really are.  I have had massages before from other places but had a giftcard for massage envy and thought I'd give them a try.  I was truly disappointed in the whole experience and will not be back."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I started going to monthly massages with Tam when I was experiencing some back pain. I'd never had a massage and was a bit apprehensive. That dissolved quickly. The environment Tam creates is relaxing and comfortable, and she communicates perfectly to ensure your comfort.

The massages themselves are incredible. For me, she combined deep massage and trigger point massage. It's hard for me to imagine how she can know so well exactly where the problem spots are and how to relax them, but she does. She is knowledgeable, intuitive, and very skilled. I have always floated out of her massage room directly following massages, and have felt relaxed for days. Her massage space is peaceful and she plays lovely jazz. I can't speak highly enough of Tam.

I continued my monthly massages with Tam for two years, but now have moved from New Orleans to Ohio, and have had some massages here, but now make appointments with Tam when I visit."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Terrible! Had a dermal piercing from a guy named John. It was crooked and he said that it was just because it was swollen. The piercing never healed it is been three or four months and I am going to get it taken out by someone other than that shop. After about a month of having it I went into the shop to get it checked out. I have my whole body pierced and also have previously had a dermal piercing in 2014 and never had to go through this type of ""healing"" process. He was really rude when I came in to talk to him about it. He was eating some type of sloppy whopper sandwich and went to try to touch my face with his greasy hand. I kind of dipped away and then he proceeded to put a glove over his dirty hand. He handed me some A&E ornament and sent me on my way.... smh."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Not sure why there are so many awful reviews for Botox. I have been to several places in the area over the years for botox and this was the first place that got what I wanted for my forehead area right on the first try. And I'm very very particular about my forehead. My brow dropped the first time I ever had Botox. It happens. You just don't know how your body is going to react and you have to go into a procedure like this understanding that. If you can't, then don't do it. Have realistic expectations. I came back for a touch up between my brows and on my crows feet because I went conservatively on my first visit because its better to have to come back then do too much and my experience was just as wonderful as the first time. I have found my permanent Botox home. Lindley Gallagher did an excellent job. Highly recommend."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Seriously, there is no reason that I didn't give it a 4. 5. I was just in a rush and had to get out of the chair. I was so disappointed in this place. They had no clue what they were doing. I wish I had read some reviews before going. I was looking for a place to get my nails done. I came here for the first time. I was very nervous about getting my nails done and they did a great job. I got a gel manicure and it was $30. The lady that did my nails was so nice and did a great job. I will definitely be back. I have been going to this salon for about a year now and I have never had a bad experience. It is always clean, professional and affordable."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I spend 5.5 hours for a color fix, cut, and color.  3 days later even tho it was the first bleach job I ever had done my hair feels like straw and there are spots that she missed. It's also 2 different colors! I can't have it rebleached now due to the damage the first time left so the only way to correct it would be to reduce it and hope for the best. I asked around and that will be the best option for me. So after 5.5 hours and $400 I'm back to square 1. I'm sorry mostly because Lisa Nunez was very nice and I liked the place otherwise. I wish I could sow you the other professionals reaction when they looked at it and felt it. I'm adding picture so you can see. The one facing the front is immediately after the color and the side one shows you a spot missed and it's location."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Had lot of paperwork to fill out upon arrival; don't know if it's online to fill out prior since it was hot sitting in lobby. Had perfectly wonderful massage, very relaxing the BOOM. Exit stage left to get water - guess I am done and get dressed? No time to get acclimated after being so relaxed - step out door, got cup of water and into the crowd at checkout. If I only had a 'happy ending' (lol - of course not that way, but ease into the end of the massage experience), would've been a top notch A. My masseur was one of the top 5 had in my life too. 

To join the club for one massage a month for $60 didn't reel me in. No one knew much about the candles, etc offered on the shelf shoved way in the corner - thought about getting one, but upon the quick rush to checkout, didn't feel like it."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My mom and I decided to give this beauty bar a try after visiting many local nail salons, and being disappointed with service. The customer service was excellent. Andrew greeted us at the Receptionist Desk. He made sure we felt comfortable from beginning to end. The classic pedicure is a few extra bucks than what we're used to paying, but it comes in many different scents. I chose lemon scent and my mom chose green tea scent. I requested a gentle pedicure and the technician Lenyna did a great job and we didn't feel rushed at all. Upon entering the salon, they make sure you take your temperature is taken to ensure health and safety. The clean salon offers tons of nail polish colors to choose from, so you won't be disappointed. They also have tons of other beauty services such as eyebrow tattoo, lip blush, lashes and much more. I plan to return in the future for another pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"People are very nice but Alyssa gave me a mullet that I am still trying to grow out three months later. She did ok with color but no different than out of the box. After specifically explaining to NOT give me a softball of hair, she cut only one layer on top of my head and left the rest all one length. When I went back and explained that to her she laughed it off and didn't offer to fix it. Instead she wanted me to come back for yet another appointment (and pay for it). 
After this horrible haircut I don't trust anyone anymore to cut my hair. Went online and watched a few YouTube videos on how to cut your own hair and it has come out absolutely perfect three times in a row now. It's super easy and I highly recommend not overpaying anymore for this especially at an overpriced salon like this one. Thanks for reading."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I just had a massage here on a Groupon deal which I thought was a good deal. My massage was not the best I've had, but it was good. I was very relaxed and fell half-asleep. LOL. The salon itself was very clean and I liked that they were able to book me the same day I called about it, and there were two receptionists at the desk and they seemed pretty busy. I wish I read some of the below reviews about signing up for $10 for the next month's then $58 the one after... that's exactly what was offered to me after the massage and I was in my weaker state of mind-- all relaxed and massaged and what not-- so I took the bate. Should I be worried? My next $10 appointment is in a couple of weeks, and I even signed up for one in June as well. Hmmm...this makes me very nervous. More to follow."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"These guys are only good here. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the one guy who did my nails was nice, but he didn't seem to be a very good nail tech. I'll be back. I'm from out of town and I'm willing to pay $30 for a fill with gel polish. I'm pretty sure the other techs here seem to be good.This place is awesome!  I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure and they were able to squeeze me in.  I loved my nail technician, she was so sweet and did such a great job!  They even have a punch card for paying cash.  I had my nails done and they look fabulous.  It's a cute little salon and I'll definitely be coming back"

Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"So very disappointed with my first experience here! Thought I would give it a try. Needed a full set and a pedicure. 

The nail technician seemed not at all experienced with doing a full set of acrylic nails! She was a bit sloppy and seemed really unsure of how to apply the product! I'm one week out and a few of my new nails are already popping off! I have never had this happen so quickly with a brand new set of nails! Not sure if it was the way they were applied or cheap product! Possibly a combination of both!!! Very disappointed! I was really hoping this would be a great place to go to because it's so close to home:(

I did a Crystal Pedicure and it was just average! When I Pay for a upgraded pedicure I want to feel that upgrade! A good massage is a must! I absolutely did not get this! Again very disappointing!

Overall extremely disappointed!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Unfortunately, we were going to be repeat customers here until this past Valentine's Day. I called the studio on a Saturday for a couples Massage on Valentine's Day (Sunday). The owner confirmed the appointment for 5pm. We showed up Sunday at 4:45pm and the door was locked, lights were off. We called the studio with no answer. 4 or 5 calls later and after a 25 minute wait outside in the snow we decided to give up. We left a message on the answering machine requesting a call back though (now almost a full week later) they have not called back to explain. Also, on our first visit, while the massages were good, the therapists were late to show up because they were getting fast food. We had to wait outside in the cold then as well. Just a heads up- if you're going to go don't expect to get started on time and make sure you dress for the weather!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"***UPDATE***
 Owner Lily did call call me to rectify my experience. I think this says a lot about the salon itself in making sure their customers are happy.  The salon and staff do seem to care and because of this I will be returning and giving them another chance. 

This is a nice, clean salon with friendly staff that care about their clients by ensuring customer satisfaction. Unfortunately my first experience here my nails did not come out pretty.  They are thicker because of the light color but they are a wavy uneven coat, she cut me once and polish all over my fingers. The girl even apologized for how awful they look and suggested I go with a different color next time. Maybe it was the nail tech because this place came highly recommended from my co workers. I still paid the nail tech and left her a nice tip. The tech was nice, super cute and friendly."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I have given it several tries, but I must say I am disappointed. Each time I have been which has been every two-three weeks for a few months now I have chosen the more expensive options for hands and feet hoping they would take longer and really let me have a relaxing time. Wrong! They have hurried through each time and then over charged me for what they did. I understand gel nails are not cheap but 40 dollars for a base manicure is ridiculous and then to rush through it? No thank you. 

I was really hoping to find Green Hills quality services in hendersonville but it looks like I will continue to drive the long distance for my nails.

Also, the young girl at the front who greets you has the worst welcoming face. She never smiles and looks at you like she is judging you up and down. Hello, I'm the one with the money paying your paycheck, please."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,This place has marketing down to a science. I was immediately impressed with the look and feel of the facility. During your first visit expect to be bombarded with a tour of their product line and packages. I came here after reading reviews of their unique techniques to reduce the pain of waxing. Beware that there is NO difference between their procedure and the other waxing centers out there. I like the idea that they are franchised making it easier to use any of their other locations. The facility was clean and the room was fit to accommodate every type of waxing procedure.I'm giving the location 3 stars.... my waxer was in a hurry to finish and missed removing a lot of the hair . It was evident that she was more concerned about how many clients she could get for the day rather than the quality of service. This was a real disappointment to me given this place is pricey.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been a patron for a couple of years now.  I followed Jenny from her previous Salon.  I get my pedicure and UV gel refills every 2 weeks, like clock work.  (Definitely choose UV gel over acrylic. There's no odor or refill lines).
The prices are very fair.  My refill is $30, where I use to pay $60-80 at the fancier salons. They don't do the flashy nail art, but for a general refill, this is my spot. I do go to other salons when I'm in the mood for design.
Rachel usually does my pedicures. She's very good and listens well. I always ask for extra attention in certain areas, and it's never a problem, never attitude. 
Overall, I'm happy here. I save a ton of money at Helen's.  If something isn't to your liking, THEY WILL FIX IT! 
Give them a shot. The staff is so friendly and warming. All of the ladies are so sweet."

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality nail salon.  I will definitely be returning.  Thanks again!!I've been going here for 3 years
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Well, where do I begin. As I walked in, I was immediately greeted by a friendly set of smiling eyes and faces and I thought to myself, ""honey I'm home."" Wow. As I proceeded with my pedicure and manicure, I was courted to the color selection station. They liked to play musical chairs amongst workers. I thought, ""who will I be tipping today?!"" In the midst of my manicure, a pungent yet all too familiar smell of anal rippage also known as a silent bus deadly or, flatulent explosion was let out. I nearly cried from the sour aroma that struck my conjunctiva and made my lacrimal glands scream for help. As I looked around, it was like a Twilight Zone episode because I felt alone and that no one else had nearly had syncope other than myself. All in all, besides the earth shattering smell of a carcass produced by the diet of earths green nature juice, the service was excellent."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Do not waste your time or money enrolling in Makami programs. I graduated the 3000 hour massage therapy course and wish I had gone literally anywhere else. Horrible program. Horrible teachers (RMTs who have graduated from Makami and have no teaching credentials). Horrible location. The tutoring program is a joke. Also, many people are not aware that this is an UN REGULATED school, meaning your credits will not transfer to any other programs ie: kinesiology, nursing, etc. Vlad, who gives the tours and lies through his teeth to get you to enroll is the School's owner's son. Do not believe a word out of his mouth, he's no better than a used car salesman and he is unqualified for his job (yay for nepotism). The iPad is useless and 3000 hours that Makami boasts as opposed to 2200 hours that every other RMT program offers just means you have to do 800 hours of unpaid gruntwork to promote the college. STAY. AWAY."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I would have rated this five stars because I used to believe this was the cheapest place to get a standard dip mani that lasts at least a month. However, it appears that they increased their price from $50 to $55 (including the $5 soak off of your previous polish charge). I don't have a regular nail technician, but as the other reviews have said, it's a hit or miss on how long your nails will last depending on who does them. It's been two weeks since I got my dip nails done and a few have broken, which came as a surprise. I find other places to be more consistent in quality no matter who's doing your nails. With the $5 increase, their price is the same as what other higher quality nail salons charge.

I will say this is still the cheapest place I know to get a regular pedi, but I would only go back ​to get my toes done."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Can I give less than 5 stars? 

I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I was seated within 5 minutes. The woman who did my nails did a great job. She took her time and did a great job. I was very pleased with the results. I will definitely be back.I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job. The place is very clean and they have a huge selection of colors to choose from.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Just had a massage from this location.  Front desk staff was outstanding, however my therapist was not so good.   I laid on the table and waited there for at least 5-7 min before he even came into the room to work on me.   After telling him that I didn't want my glutes done nor did I want my shoulders stretched (shoulder injury), he made it a point to do both.   Then he spent too much time with pressure points instead of a nice, relaxing massage.   Poking and pushing his fingers on me starting to become annoying!  When he did massage, it hurt...felt like he was rubbing my skin off my bones and rubbing in the same spot over and over.  The 2nd worst massage of my life and I've had a lot of massages.  No personality and very much just going through the motions it seems.  Will not be back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I came here for a quick spray tan for a wedding I am in. As a bridesmaid, I did not want to look too pale for the pictures. I found this place on Groupon and the tan they offered was the base level but I added the next level up for $13 more. 

The place is so clean and it was very easy to get to. There were also plenty of parking. The technician was very knowledgeable since I have never gotten a spray tan before. She went over how everything would work and she answered all my questions. I could tell she had done this thousands of times because of how quickly she did it and also how good of a job it was. She made sure my nails, palms and the back of my feet were well protected. 

My tan came out very natural and not streaky or orange. I would definitely come back here when I need another spray tan!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have had hundreds of mani/pedis, all over the country, and that goes for my mom, and after leaving this place we both thought that these were the best ones we have ever had. Both people who did our nails were perfectionists. 

On top of the quality of work the people did, there was a large quantity of colors to choose from. The salon is beautiful, and has massage chairs (obviously a plus). The owner couldn't be any nicer, as well as the other woman who did my mom's nails.

With the quality of work, and the atmosphere of the salon, you can't beat the pricing either. My mom paid, and thought that she had only paid for hers, when she realized she had paid for both of us. 

Overall, I have had some very poor experiences and some very good experiences with getting my nails done, but this is definitely somewhere that I would come back too, and is my new favorite place."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"My wife and I can't recommend this place enough! We've been going for a couple years now. We are always treated with respect, kindness and professionalism. We always leave with a smile on our faces. 

We have a loyal customer for life and always look forward to our visit. They always remember my name and I always feel welcome. My daughter goes to her stylist, Jenni, she is amazing!! 

I highly recommend this salon to everyone!I have been to this salon about a dozen times.  I love it.  The staff is always very friendly and it's a clean environment.  The owners are very nice.  The owner is very accommodating and does a great job on my nails.  I would recommend them to anyone.This is my favorite nail salon!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"$35 for a 60 minute massage. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the massage was a little too painful. I will not be returning to this place. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the massage was very good. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from this salon. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The gentleman who did my nails was very rough and cut me multiple times while doing my nails. The polish was sloppy, he cut my cuticles and cut my cuticles. I am still bleeding after my pedicure. I went back to get it fixed and the manager told me to come back to get it fixed. I didn't like the color at all."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,ZERO STARS. Went in yesterday and had the worst experience. I came in for a gel fill and the woman doing my nails didn't even know what she was doing. She was very rough with my nails and when she was done I was extremely upset. My nails look horrible. The acrylic is uneven. I will never come back here.I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job. The place is very clean and they have a huge selection of colors. We went in and were greeted by a friendly lady who was kind and helpful. She did a wonderful job on my daughter's nails and my daughter's nails. I got a gel mani and a pedi.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I've been going to Volume for a couple years now. I always leave happy and satisfied. I have had facials, waxing, and hair extensions. They do a great job and are friendly and professional. I've always had a great experience with the staff and the products they use. I have also seen the owner, Nicole, and she is a very sweetheart. I always get a great deal on the products and they are all great at what they do. I've never had to wait for a service. I'm so happy I found them!I went here yesterday for a pedicure and it was fantastic. I was very impressed with the work they did and the attention to detail. I loved how they were able to take care of me."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"The best nail salon in Tampa! 

After having awful experiences at multiple nail salons after I moved back to Tampa I almost gave up on getting my nails done anymore. Thankfully, Fancy Nails was recommended to me and I haven't gone anywhere since. 

There's always plenty of technicians so the wait isn't too long, but I try to call ahead for an appointment just to be safe. They also have the best selections of polishes, gels, and acrylics I've ever seen (and I've been to plenty of places to have my nails done). They are clean and do a fantastic job, and I'm very picky about my nails. They are also priced very well. My pedicure lasts far longer than any other pedicure I've had (and for a pedicure to last 3-4 weeks for a runner is awesome!). The techs are also current on the latest trends, like doing ombré pink and white. I get tons of compliments on my nails all the time."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"This is a courtesy warning...This should be zero stars.Do not waste your time, this place is the slowest I've been to in my 25 years, they say it will be 5 minute wait, and it turns into half hour before they tell you "" oh I forgot I have an appt.
now""  Terrible customer service.. Won't speak english to you your 
entire appt.. I gel manicure took 1.5 hours and still looked the worst 
I've ever had.
This place is unsanitary, watch they will use the same file and
emery board ( gross ). NO clean brushes either. The polish has been diluted and does not 
adhere. I left and had to go down the street to another nail salon to have this awful mess on my hands done correctly. AWFUL, awful..
I called the owner after I had left and she pretended like she didn't
know who I was, I was like "" I was there an hour ago ""....Unprofessional
BBB review would be closing this place down."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I went here with for a daddy/daughter mani-pedi. They are located in Lawnside adjacent to the Pathmark market.

The salon is clean and the staff is very friendly. They tried to upsell me on services, but they weren't pushy about it. My daughter upgraded to a cute floral design on her toes which was well done. I thought the trimming/shaping on my fingernails was a bit uneven and could have been better, but it looks okay and I was satisfied considering the price. The pedicure (by a different technician) came out fantastic.

I did call ahead and they recommended that I make an appointment, especially for the two of us together, but the salon wasn't packed and there was a group of five women who came in later without an appointment.

They only accept cash payment, but they have a $1 ATM in the back part of the salon. They have a great combo special for $26 from Monday to Wednesday. 

I will definitely go here again."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Visited for the first time today as a result of the Yelp reviews. I stopped, without an appointment, for a brow wax. It took a moment but the front receptionist found Cora, who was available. The place is in a strip mall but once you walk in the door you know it's a bit classier than the usual nail salon/waxing stop. Cora was sweet. Can you say that about someone as they're pulling errant hairs from you body?!? Yep. She asked me what I wanted done, listened and then told me what and how she was going to do it. Fast and efficient and very professional. Would I go back: absolutely. Will I go back? Probably not for a brow wax. It was $20, although because it was my first visit, I received 50% off. If I was having something else waxed, this would be the place. My monthly brow maintenance budget comes in at approximately $10, so this won't be a regular stop."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I didn't sign up for a membership until October and decided to cancel. When I got there, the woman who was working there told me to sign up for a membership. She was so nice and talked me through the whole process. 

I then signed up for the membership. I had a membership and was really happy with the massage and how the membership worked out. I also signed up for a membership with the groupon and was really excited about it. I was so excited to find out that they had a membership option. I liked the fact that it was not just a membership, it was a monthly membership.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"This was my first SNS manicure and the girl did a great job! I got a regular manicure and it lasted about 3 weeks. The prices are very reasonable. The only reason I don't give it 4 stars is because it was a busy Saturday and I didn't have time to go to work. I also didn't get a hot stone massage on my hands. I got a gel manicure and it was $50. They only charged me $30 which I think is very reasonable. I will be going back for sure.I love this place! I have been here a few times, and have always had great service.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,My bf got me a gift certificate here and i was excited bc i was long overdue for one. Decided to use it on my bday. I was able to walk in and get service. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday afternoon. The staff was friendly and the environment looked clean and inviting. I had a 60 min session and you can choose from 2 options: 60 min of full body w/hot stones or 30 min full body and 30 min foot massage. I opted for the 1st. The room was a typical massage room. Only downsides are the proximity to magazine st. lots of car noise and the sheets. They seemed too flimsy for my liking. i felt like the masseuse might be able to catch a nip glimpse. Lol. Anywho. the masseuse was great! He asked abt my comfort with pressure and the hot stones felt great! This was a really good experience. May just need to bring earplugs and nip covers next time.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have always had a good experience here. They do have a formulated routine, but it works for me. The full body massage definitely hits all areas. I have found whether you pick 4 or 6 level, it's still quite deep. I like that you don't have to invest multiple hours like at a day spa. It's 30 or 60 minutes and usually very little waiting time. The bad: On three occasions, I have had an additional dollar added to my already 25-30% tip (these guys work hard and I know they depend on tips).  Deceptively adding the $1 is bad business. Let's say your 30 minute massage is $22 and you leave a 7 dollar tip, $29 total right? They'll mumble ""$30, ok"". I have a solution: pay in exact cash. I'm not going to tip as much in the future to make up for the gouging. Sorry, it's bad business and deceptive. That said, a great place to get out the kinks!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,WORST NAIL SALON I HAVE EVER BEEN IN! They were so rude to me no one greeted me I have to wait 5 mins before someone said anything to me. Then I asked them how much it would be for a polish change with gel. The lady said for a solid color it would be $8 and I asked about french because that is what I wanted and she said that was $12. Which were the same prices I normally pay. I sat down and another lady came up to me and said I'm going to charge you $25 for you gel french polish. I had  said that the other lady told me these prices and she said well I am going to charge you $25. I couldnt believe it. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AND LET ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND CO-WORKERS KNOW! They should learn a lesson from this about customer service and not trying to rip me off on prices.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I came in to get a fill and the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I had two nails that were crooked, and they were chipped after only a week.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Beautiful space, easy to find, (especially with the signs in the parking lot). Trying a new studio out can be intimidating, but the entire experience was very welcoming, from people at the door, desk, other clients and the instructor, I felt welcomed and prepared for the new class. The facility is clean and has a beautiful set up with windows, a chandelier, and fire place in the studio. The girl at the front desk Courtney, walked me right to the studio and told me what I needed to know for class. The instructor, and other clients made sure I had everything I needed before starting the class and helped me feel really comfortable. The class I took was a restorative reiki class and super slow and calming. I slept like a baby that night. I bought the new student package to try out a bunch of classes and am happy I did. Looking forward to getting to know this studio as it's pretty close to home."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"The Brewery District is lucky to have a spa such as this one. 
Focus Laser and Spa (in the process of a name change) is under new management - management who is modern, fun, and personable. Owner Andrea knows more about skin than any person I've ever met, The relocation and brand new, gorgeous spa built from the ground up is a sure sign that this business is state of the art.
The estheticians under their employ are all very kind, customer-oriented girls who are all unique, which means there is someone for everyone.
The spa boasts intimate treatment rooms that are sure to relax you and make you feel comfortable. The pedicure station is fashioned after a living room - with copper pedi basins coupled with couches and lounge chairs - so cool!
Focus is also heavily medically-oriented, which means along with standard spa services, you can also book laser hair removal, laser skin treatments, fat-reduction laser, therapeutic body massage, and more. Also, can we say laser specials?"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I had a SilkPeel with Kayla on Saturday and it was great! It wasn't my first time having a SilkPeel because I've had it previously at a dermatologists' office, but it was my first time at Poppy & Ivy. If you haven't had a SilkPeel before, I highly recommend it! I really liked how Kayla took her time throughout the facial and how knowledgeable she was about skincare products.

For the SilkPeel, she began by cleansing my skin and applying warm towels over my face to open my pores. She then used the specialized handpiece to exfoliate my skin and suction away any debris. Afterward, she went over my face once again with the handpiece to infuse it with a brightening/hydrating serum. We ended with a soothing cooling mask. Afterward, my skin was smooth, refreshed and glowing. I'm usually wary about facial treatments because I have sensitive, acne prone skin, but I had no breakouts or redness with this. I'll definitely be returning here for future appointments!"

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"If they think it's too complicated, they make excuses. I asked for roses and they offered me two of the same. I don't want cookie cutter tattoos. What a joke. The (hopefully new) guy at the desk took my deposit and then I was told that's now how they do deposits so no proof. I don't even see why they took a deposit, what's to work on with two of the same rose? And now I see several of the same rose on their website. And the whole time I was in the chair, the worst pain I endured was having to listen to these petty fools talk about other employees in the rudest way. Big heads, small minds. I did have one positive experience-- Gwen pierced my daughter and really put her at ease. (That's why I came in for my tats.) My daughter is smitten, but it's not enough to go out of my way for. Somebody put these boy children in a hospitality class."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I used to hate going to get my hair done. Almost as much as going to the dentist. Just not my idea of fun. 

I've been going to Gadabout for a few years. The Salon has a comfortable vibe with a hip ""Industrial"" meets ""Provincial"" aesthetic. You'll know what I mean when you see it. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is pleasant. They offer coffee, herbal teas, and infused water while you're sitting, leafing through various celebrity magazines, Elle, and my personal favorite, Architectural Digest. 

Giancarlo has done my hair all this time. He is an adorably funny, patient, and gifted stylist. He just celebrated 10 years with Gadabout, doing hair and teaching. He approaches his work with such joie de vivre that it absolutely makes for a fun experience. I love when he rattles off various numeric color combination to an assistant and they know what he's talking about. Giancarlo and his assistants do a fabulous job and I feel genuinely cared for while I'm there."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I haven't been to a lot of salons but this is my favorite out of maybe 6 or 8 I've graced with my pale presence.  I am time poor so I go for that mega/ultra beds, they have a couple of the really high-end ones.  I think two or so is pretty typical.  What I like is you can buy sessions as opposed to just time.  So you can buy five sessions and use them whenever you want as opposed to getting a two week run or whatever.  Plus I really like the two high-end beds that I used and everything inside is superclean including the bathroom.  The other places I've used in the area have been in Clayton and Brentwood and the prices here are much lower.  And finally the staff is cool and helpful.  It's a tanning bed place so I'm not sure what else to say.   Check it out of you need some color."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place was great. I was somewhat nervous because other places in University City are iffy, but it's a great experience from start to finish. I'm not super nitpicky but I know what does and doesn't work on my hair, which is thick coarse and wavy (2c). Got greeted right away, Kelly talked about what I wanted, gave about a 10 second scalp massage (short, but fine) then shampoo/condition. The hand massage during that part is a great touch. I had to stand for the first part of the cut, which seemed strange to me, but I was so pleased with how it came out and the blowout was great. Then I got a followup call the next day asking how the cut was, and I got a new client gift bag (apparently I was supposed to get one when I left, but I'm only 7-8 blocks away so going in wasn't a hassle). A+ customer service, the cut looks great, and the price can't be beat."

I was TERRIFIED about the pain, but Penny was so calm and reassuring. She talked me through it. And it really wasn't that bad. 
I was scared of nothing, ya'll. 
I don't know if other technicians hurt more or what it is that she specifically does to make the process so easy.... Maybe Penny just has the juice. Whatever it is, I'm with it. She has gained another loyal client. 

All that aside... this is not a frilly, pampering, have a glass of champagne type establishment. Even if it were, you wouldn't have time to drink it because she works SO FAST! I was in and out in about 15 minutes. It really was over before I knew to be hurt, lol.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I came here after seeing so many positive reviews (mostly) but I left this salon feeling severely disappointed. To begin, I normally get gel color on my toes- my toenails are relatively thin and the gel did not really help so I had a thin layer of acrylic on my one big toe to keep it from being too frail. I came here after the acrylic was removed and asked to have another thin layer placed on top. The woman who did my toes was an older lady and she was so rough I flinched away from her at several points. However, my nail was repaired and my pedicure was t absolutely horrible. The horror lies in my ""acrylic"" refill. There was no acrylic involved. I don't even know what was used it was an aqua based bonding powder that my finger was dipped into then patted off. Come four days later my thumb nail was broken. My gel manicure is chipped and I'm so disappointed. Steer clear."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"After reading the reviews I went to The Lotus Room expecting a 5 star experience. I've been to tons of day spas and massage therapists and this one of my least favorite experiences. The decor is boho, trendy, and definitely cute! but the flow was off. There wasn't a place to sit in a robe or anything and relax before or after your massage. There was a waiting room but it was never offered as a place to relax post massage. I've never been to  day spa that didn't offer that so I was really disappointed. I also hate to say this but my massage from Tessa was one of the worst I've ever had. The pressure was so soft, like the pressure you use to rub in lotion. not nearly enough pressure to do any muscle work. I should have said something but I honestly thought it was going to get better so I was waiting for that.  For $245 dollars I felt majorly gipped."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I plan on this place being my lifetime salon! It was recommended to me by a friend who sees Stephanie, who specializes in curly hair.
I've seen April twice now. I finally decided to do a fashion color: icy lavender. I met for a brief consultation the day before my real appointment. She answered all my questions and explained the steps involved and provided a price estimate. The actual appointment took about 4 hours. This included bleaching, toning and the color. I also got a trim. She educated me on how to take care of the color. I bought a custom made conditioner that has some tint in it to help the color last which April made. My second appointment I went with a pixie cut and I love it! April has very encouraging with making these big changes.
The place is chic and modern. The staff is fairly young and trendy. Lots of product to offer including travel sizes. If you refer someone, you get a free full-size product."

The only thing I would like to say is the pool area is small, but it's great for those that don't like to be in the water.I've been going to see Kim for almost 3 years now. She is amazing! I go to her every few weeks and I'm so happy with the results. She does amazing work and I am always happy with the results. I always see her when I come in and she is the only one I trust to do my nails. They always do a great job and I am always happy with my nails. I've also gotten my hair done by Kim and I highly recommend her to everyone. I've been going to Kim for years and she's always been amazing!I went here with a group of friends"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Erin gave me what is a real professional cut and beard trim. She also did a great job.I had an excellent experience here. I got the basic manicure and it was amazing. I came in with no problem and I was very pleased. My nail technician was very friendly and thorough. I will definitely be back!Just had a great pedicure by a different lady. She did a great job! I highly recommend this place.I was looking for a new nail salon and found this one on yelp. I walked in, and was immediately greeted by a very sweet lady. The place is beautiful, and the staff was very kind. I was sat in the pedicure chair right away, and the woman who did my nails was very professional and did a great job. I also received a great pedicure"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Came here for a pedicure and a manicure. The pedicure was great! The massage was a little too hard to get out of the massage chair, but the place is clean and nicely decorated. The only thing I wish they would have been more open to open up after the first time was to accommodate me. I did get a free glass of wine with my pedicure. I was very pleased with the results. I'm looking forward to getting a pedicure next time!I had a great experience at this location. I got a Brazilian wax, which is usually a little painful, but the results were great. The woman who waxed my eyebrows was very sweet, and I enjoyed talking with her, but my waxer was very quiet. She made me feel very comfortable, and my Brazilian wax was pretty"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Where do I start with this place. I wish I could give 0 stars. I waited over an hour for servicing. And didn't leave there til over 2 hours later. Made me late for an important event. They do not have safe social distancing measures in place. The seating is all on top of each other. They are not very clean. The guy who did my pedicure did a very mediocre job overall on the nail work itself. I could've done it at home for the $85 they charged me for dip + pedi. He used dirty tools and the towel he used to dry my feet was so rough & scratchy. It looked like an old dirty dish cloth-very nasty. They were just herding cattle this day because, there was a customer that came in who had an appointment that they were about to turn around and send home because they were so unorganized and forgot her. I'll Never come back here again. Terrible experience and unclean practices!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Racist experience. Please  do not go to this location if you have ethnic African hair. For any service You are allowed to ask for any student you want EXCEPT GETTING CORNROWS??? Their excuse is a ""new policy"" that you can NOT request the only two girls that know how to cornrow braid. This was a tad bit racist to me. No where in their place do they have that policy posted up about cornrows cant get request. This is a disservice to a multi billion dollar service business. I called prior and they booked me with who I asked for then when I arrive in was told my request could not do my hair. I was not able to get my hair finished due to lack of time & experience, and still got charged per hour for ""TWO braids"" I was there for 2 hours and 45 minutes! On top of that I was called hostile for asking questions to why I couldn't get my requested student!!! #racist"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Danielle provides excellent service, advice, technical ability, and creativity. Ever since my first hair cut and highlight came out a huge success, I have put complete faith and artistic license in the hands of Danielle. Now, when I go in I simply say, ""do whatever you want"" (with whatever barriers I have; work restrictions, styling laziness). I always leave beaming. Going to a salon used to feel like a chore, or even lead to stress due to the lack-of-, or mis-communication all around. But at Artisans, I feel relaxed and confident as Danielle is great at helping discuss the type of hair that works for you. She takes into account your restrictions, your style, bone structure, and adds her own creative touch, which always results in awesome, avant-garde styles specific to you. ALSO She is quick and amazing at cutting curly hair. My friend has his curly mop-fro cut there and swears by it. (Apparently curly hair stylists are hard to find? So just throwing that out there."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Bellevue has lots of options for nails, but Nailvana is currently my go to. I get the dip manicure about once a month and they have a great selection of colors. The salon is always nice and clean and they tend to have Marvel movies up on the tv, as opposed to the usual home improvement network which get s big thumbs up from me!

I've had my nails done by Ethan, Nikki and Nina and they've all done a great job on my short nails. My manicures have lasted about 3-4 weeks each time. Their price point is actually more reasonable than many of the other places in the area and they have a great assortment of services. 

I have yet to get a pedicure here, though I've seen them advertising a jelly pedicure which I am very much looking forward to trying in the near future. If you are in the area and looking to get your nails done, I would definitely recommend stopping in to see them."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"LOVE this place! when i go to the salon i usually get a gel mani and a pedi. so i had to get a pedi and the mani was great. i was so happy with the service and the results. they also have a special for gel nails which is also great. i will be going back! also, the owner is great. i've had great experiences there. i recommend them to everyone. it is nice to be able to get in and out in about 30 minutes. my nails are perfect. will definitely be back for my next fill!I'm so glad I found this place!

Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"LYING SCAMMERS. BAIT AND SWITCH. 

I paid $45 for a simple pedicure and a gel manicure. The technician was very nice and the manicure was great. The massage chair was comfy and the paint job was good. I would come back to get my nails done by a different tech. I will be back.I have been going to Oggi Nails for over 4 years now and I can honestly say that I have never had a bad experience. The staff is friendly, the salon is clean, and the services are excellent. I never feel rushed or rushed. The pedicure is great and the gentleman who did my pedicure did a wonderful job. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.They do a great job and I've had a good experience here"

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"To whom ever this may be an issue. 

I left my review in person and asked them to fix the issue. The manager took the time to call me back and get me to speak to her manager. She said she would fix it. I was still waiting for her to call me back.

I did not feel the need to ask her to fix it. I did not want to make it a big deal to go through this with a manager. I will not be going back to this salon.I have been going to Ashley for about a year now. She is super friendly and knowledgeable. She does a great job at waxing. I would recommend her to anyone.I have been to a few different nail salons in the area and I have finally found my go to!  I have been to many different nail"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I'm actually just finishing up my pedicure. I asked for the salon pedicure. All seats were full but I was still seated within a few minutes. So that was good. The pedi started off good. Nice sugar scrub. But after the second sugar rub it was starting to hurt. Now the third one...I had to ask them to be gentle. It was really hurting. Now they put on a lotion (I got to pick) it was lavender and they put on hot towels on top. It was not good. It was really hot then freezing!!! Weird. That lotion left my legs freezing. Then they pulled out hot stones and put them on after they took the towels off. And rubbed my legs. I thought oh good something warm but they actually hurt as my legs were just raw! In the end they did a good job with the pedicure but the process was quite painful. I will never get spa pedi. Again. Maybe a regular one would suit others better?
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I like that you can book on line. But for my 4 pm and I didn't  get seen until  4:15 and I was left sitting there without even the gel polish samples to look at. Mediocre job, I see that my polish has  waves and ripples. The tech station was pretty dirty covered with dust, her empty Starbucks cup, another drink of some sort, cluttering the station and making it look messy. (Added that clarification for Duane)

Update: two days later polish is chipping. The manager commented on this review and said they would fix it.. but I'm hesitant. I would never go to that tech again.  She bragged about how they are number one on Yelp, but that wasn't my experience. I had a gel manicure 3 weeks ago in San  Francisco and it was  cheaper, clean, and lasted much longer. I might get it fixed. But its inconvenient for me, it should have been done right the first time. So we shall see."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been having my hair cut at Moosehead by April for close to a year and I really like the way she cuts my hair and offers tips on taking care of my hair between trips. With other barbers, I always had an issue where the hair on the side of my head would not lay down flat. Now I do not have that problem; April does a great job.

Moosehead does not smell or look like a typical salon and it is geared for the men folk. HD TVs and satellite TV all tuned to sports or whatever you want to watch. Plus, your choice of drinks. They offer other services I have yet to try; one being smoking cigars.

Moosehead is located conveniently near Vanderbilt on Music Row with parking on 17th Ave S or behind the building.

If you are not happy with the rush-rush of your typical barber shop and you want to be spoiled a little, you should try Moosehead. Finally, I would suggest making an appointment."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Malika is a life saver! I've always waxed my eyebrows and when my eyebrow lady was on vacation, I needed to find someone else ASAP. My good friend has amazing eyebrows and goes to Aisha's so I figured I'd give threading another chance. I personally think it hurts more than waxing so I was never a fan. I decided to visit Aisha's in a bind and I'm so glad I did. I was seated right away and Malika quickly pointed out some issues with my eyebrows (uneven shape for example). I was nervous for the big reveal at the end. Will I have any eyebrows left? Will I still look like a wolf? I had no idea! Lo and behold. After many tears (yes I cried like a baby but it was totally worth it), I had two amazing, arched eyebrows. I finally had an arch in the right eyebrow that no one else could achieve. I am so happy I took the plunge and I will definitely be back!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I hate leaving bad reviews, but I had an awful experience here. I went in to get a full set of acrylics. The technician seemed annoyed, when I asked her to just do a little more in the middle of the set. I was charged $45 for acrylics and a full set with gel polish. I was told $45 for a full set with regular acrylics. When I asked for a specific color, they told me $30. I got a gel manicure and regular pedicure. The technician was nice and did a good job. However, my nails started chipping after one day. The next day, after only one week, the polish started chipping. I was a bit disappointed. It was disappointing to see that I had to go back in a week to get them fixed."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Before I tried Diamond Spa, I had the pleasure of meeting two women who did my massage. The massage was amazing. The woman that did the massage was so great, and made sure to take her time to make sure my body was relaxed. I felt so relaxed after the massage and felt so much better afterwards!

I had a deep tissue massage with Jessica and it was awesome. I will definitely be back!I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. I had to wait a little bit because I had to get my nails done before I was seated. I had to wait a little because they didn't have any customers. The pedicure was good but I would definitely not return. I got a full set with gel polish and I had to go back to have them redone."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I came here with the recommendation of a friend and decided to try it out. I was not disappointed. The salon is cute and bright. The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is nice. They had a great selection of colors. The pedicure was good. I would definitely recommend this place. I was also impressed with the massage chairs. I didn't feel rushed at all. I just went with the deluxe pedicure. It was $30 which I think is very reasonable. I will be returning. I have been going to this nail salon for almost a year now and I am very pleased. I have been going here for over a year and have never had a bad experience. The salon is clean and the staff is very friendly. My favorite is Trina and Kim. They have a ton of colors to choose from.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I heard about Next Salon and decided to give it a shot. 

The salon is very cute and clean. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is so relaxed. The massage chairs are awesome and the massage chairs are perfect. I had a mani/pedi for $25. The place is also very clean and the staff is very professional. I will definitely be returning!I went there to get a pedicure. The girl who did my pedicure was very rough and rough. I was so upset. I told her I was going to just get a polish change and she said it would be $45. I left with my feet soaking in acetone and I had to take off a gel manicure. I would not recommend this place.This is my favorite nail salon! I have been going to the same lady"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"When I stepped into the place, pretty much everyone who works there smiled and say hi to me. I care a lot about good manners so, that was great for me. 
Now, the service: I didn't wait, I was immediately seated, I always go to these places because I bite my nails and I've been in very expensive ones, high quality and cheap ones, low quality ones. 
I'm new to the area and since they are besides my bank I stopped there, I had fake nails with gel manicure, I paid about 30.00 first time and the last time I went (for refill) I paid like half of that.
What I love: The massage with stones they give you when your nails are drying out, also, I have a horrible finger (from biting it) and somehow it looks great now, they added lotions to it, no one ever did that before. I felt appreciated and I won't go anywhere else.
I haven't had other services but I will be posting when I do."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Coming from a person who get bi-weekly massages, I was pretty disappointed at the quality of massages at Tibet. 

I've been having a lot of back pain/tightness for the last Week. I usually have my go-to masseuse but they're located in New York. After reading some positive reviews, I made an apt for a deep tissue. 

I walk in and the guy who I made an appt with wasn't there. They assured me that I would receive the same experience, so I went through with it. 

The massage was mediocre. For the first twenty minutes, it felt like I was getting a quick massage at a nail salon. The masseuse did not do any focus points, knowing my back had many areas of tightness. It's crazy when the person who is receiving a massage can feel when the masseuse is getting tired. 

Not to mention, the next day, my back felt worse than it did prior to me coming. Maybe it was the masseuse? Who knows. But won't be going back."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"By far the best nail salon I've found on the west side. The ladies do a quality job and have a wide selection of colors, textures, and artistic effects for nails. They do a great job if you bring a picture to work with or have an idea of what you want. Like many working women, I have very little time to get my nails done, so when I do I want it to last and look good. I've tried most of the high rated places on this side of town. None of them have lived up to the rating for me and one was ridiculously expensive and my nails started shipping the next day. Honestly this place is a little gem. Wish I'd found it a year ago. The low ratings here seem to be about having to wait too long. To get your nails done on Saturday at the High Time, why would you expect to walk right in? Call ahead or slip in on a day after work."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I'd say this was a very good experience due to the fact that they were ready to go and didn't have a ton else going on in the shop so that me and my sister got prompt service with our appointment. They took their time and were patient with our back and forth with decisions of what colors to do! I got the luxury pedicure it was 44 mins long and included the usual scrub and leg mask. And Nail dip/ manicure. My nails are flawless and indestructible as the guy said they would be. He took a lot of time to perfect them and make them even and not overly bulky. It's a small intimate shop, usually by appointment, so keep that in mind. Honestly having an appointment works well for me so I know I'm not sitting around! The hand massage was amazing, and is half the reason I like to do manicures and he did not skimp over it. Thanks for be so thorough and giving great service!"

I will be back for sure!This place is great! The customer service is always good and the massages are amazing! I've been going here for almost a year now and it's never a bad experience.

I would definitely recommend Studio Teknik to anyone looking to get a massage or facial!I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the nail technicians are always happy to answer my questions! It's very easy to book online and I love that they have a rewards program. I'm not sure why I don't give this place more than 5 stars!I absolutely love my experience here. I have been coming here for years and I have never left disappointed. I've been going to the same stylist for 10 years and she has never cut my hair the way I like it.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,As wierd as it sounds...I'm not an expert on massages but I've had a lot of them. I've had the best massage of my life and have had a lot of massages.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I normally don't write reviews but La Palette and their people constantly impress me. Today was the first time I got my eyebrow tattoo and semi-permanent eyeliner tattoo and it was simply amazing! Cecilia is truly an artist and she is such a sweet (and gorgeous of course) person. She explained to me for every step she did, she made sure I liked the shape of eyebrow she designed for me, and during the procedure she constantly checked in with me to see if I was doing ok. Really loved the work she did! Totally changed me!! For the longest time, I thought my eyebrow was hopeless, BUT, that's only because I didn't know Ceci. La Palette is pretty much my go to place for pedi, mani, eyelash extension, eyebrow tattoo, eyeliner tattoo etc.. they literally have the best everything!  And people here are so friendly and dedicated. They put a ton of effort in what they do, they always make sure they do it perfect. Best beauty salon in Phill!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The best tanning salon in St Louis, hand down. I've been tanning on a regular basis since high school - either in the bed or spray, so I've been to more than my fair share of tanning salons across the country. The staff here makes the entire process seamless from the moment you walk in the door (whether you are a beginner or experienced tanner) and they are incredibly professional. They are knowledgeable about the products they sell as well as the best bed or level to achieve your desired results. They also do a great job of ensuring the entire salon is clean from top to bottom. I've never left with anything other than a smile on my face. I'm a big fan of the spray tan booths and solutions they use as well as Beds 1 and 2. My friends and I stop by for a ""cocktail"" (regular tan + spray tan) before the weekend or just when we need a little bronze. Highly recommend - you won't be disappointed!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Right now the salon is fairly clean but in saying that, it won't be long before it will start looking like the rest of the dirty salons. I don't feel this salon is following Sanitation regulations. The staff is very unfriendly!!!
The nail tech at the first table when you walk in does not do a good job at all. When I'm forced to sit at her table I know I'm wasting my money. She leaves my nails with  bumps and waves on the nail beds. She also thinks she is to good to give a pedicure that I have noticed. The gal that gives the pedicures is good but not thorough with her work but very talkative. Out of the two men that work there, the younger is probably the best tech they have. Alway hope to get him but they won't let you request who you would like. (His name is Huey)
One last thing. Prices are alway different whenever I go in there."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have a couple of friends who go here and suggested it to me! One of the nail techs won best manicurist in the city and they've won a ton of other awards. I moved and then covid happened so I had to find a new nail salon once Philly allowed this service to reopen. 

It's a super cute and clean salon. More high end than what I'm used to with my nail salons in the past. That, and being in Old City, makes this more pricier than what I'm used to. A classic manicure is $25 and a classic pedicure is $45. If you want French, it's an additional $10. This visit I spent $80 for a regular mani and pedi. 

I personally don't think the pedicure I received this time was worth $45 but definitely quality work, service, and polish. I've been going for a few months now and my manicures last 2 weeks! 

Free parking in the lot literally next door and you can tip the manicurist with Venmo!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I recommend trying this school.I love the massages I receive from this practice! I have been here before but had a different therapist both times and have had a positive experience each time. I have had several massages at various places and have been satisfied with the quality of the massages and the prices. I highly recommend it!I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very unprofessional. I showed her a picture of what I wanted, which I was not going to do because it was so hard to get exactly what I wanted. She was not willing to do what I wanted, which I have never experienced at any other spa. She kept telling me she would have to do it in 3 hours. I explained that I wanted the same style as my"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I've always liked the Peppermill, but the last time I went in I was really disappointed.  The room was not very comfortable.  There were several TV's, so it was pretty loud.  When I checked in, I was told it would be $50 for the night.  I was told it was $50 for the night and $20 for the night.  I will say I went there to have a nice view of the casino.  It's very nice, but it's not worth it.  The rooms are really nice and clean.  They are usually very busy with people and the people are usually very busy.  I would suggest that you get there early and come out early and stay in the room.  There are only two pools and one bathroom.  The pool is a little dirty but I have no issue going"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Lets just say that I received the best massage by Kristen that I ever had by far. I never had a Thai massage, despite my wife raving how great they are. I finally listened to my wife and saw Kristen and then went and thanked my wife for pushing to get one. Her professionalism and knowledge were unbelievable. I never felt so relaxed and at peace during a message before. I am always so tense from how deep people go. But not her, she really listened to what I told her in the beginning of the session and knew just how hard to go. I am not an expert on messages but sure had enough of ones to know she is the real deal. I will not look for any one else any more. I will be a regular client for sure. Oh and by the way, now a few days later I still feel amazing. Thanks Kristen for awesome message you gave. I will tell all my friends about your Transformational Movement."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"It takes a lot for me write a bad review, but a one star is deserved. I was turned off initially by how unprofessional the front desk worker was. Then the tech tried to talk my mother out of a treatment. That was very bizarre. It must be the norm, since more techs were seen doing this to other customers. I must say that my massage was great, but it wasn't until I was allowing my nails to dry did I notice how horrible of a job they did. Paint was all over my toes, feet were left dry and rough, and there was still dirt under my nail. The tech did not remove or clean my nails! And it was noticeable due to the bad paint job. Usually leaving the nail spa is an adventure because you are slipping and sliding with every step, I'm however able to stomp out due to the dryness of my feet. Don't waste your money or time. I could have done a better job at home."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"If anyone is looking for the Best Nail technician  in Reno/Sparks area .... look no further.  I've had several technicians through out the years but once I found Kelly, I knew I was finished looking.  I've been going to her for the last 3 1/2 years  and she's only gotten better.  I NEVER have any issues!  No lifting, splitting, cracking, and they look like a new set every time!  Only issues are my own when I break one but that is also a rarity !  I'm not easy on them either!  I love my yard and am working in it all the time, so even as rough as I am on them I've only broke a few in all those years.  She also continues her education in nails so always best products along with best job ever!  To top it off she is a sweetheart and I look forward to our visits!  You will never regret switching to Kelly, I promise"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,Last weekend I was at home trying to Google a Paul Mitchell salon in my area. By chance I came across all the positive reviews for this salon and decided I would call to make an appointment.  To my shock the lady on the other end said she had an opening if I'm wiling to come down in an hour. An appointment on a Saturday as a walk-in!!!! If you frequent high end salons you know how unheard of that is. I  jumped at it and quickly headed there. I was met by an awesome stylist Lee who took the time to ask questions about my hair and what I wanted to achieve.  I felt he really listening to me and gave advice on what he felt would be best for my hair. He didn't over sell anything and had a great personality.  I walked out of the salon with an amazing cut and deep chocolate brown color and couldn't be happier. I felt renewed again. Thank you Lee.

She takes her time and is very precise. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and it's always a good experience. I highly recommend!I had an excellent experience at this location. My sister had a very bad experience with her hair colorist and a stylist at another salon. After talking to my sister the entire time, I decided to give it a shot.

The salon itself is very clean, modern and well-maintained. The stylist did a good job on my hair, but the other stylist did a great job on my hair. My hair was a mess when I went to pay for the blow out, but my"

The girl doing my nails didn't speak English so it was very awkward. The woman doing my nails was very rough and she was not careful.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"(My Google review: 7mos ago.)  I've had several treatments here and most were great. I'm very disappointed in Kybella I was told that at 3 treatments I'd see a difference but I did not notice anything.  I came to find out that I could've done Sculpsure for less and used Kybella for any fat remaining.  Why wasn't I informed of this in the beginning.   I feel a better examination should've been done to benefit patient not the pockets of the doctor.

4/27/2019: So on my Google review Greenspring replys as if everything is resolved and I'm happy.   NOT!  Months later and I've still had no resolve to my issue besides a follow up appointment with a bunch of empty promises that Dr Cadoux has not fulfilled.  I have several emails requesting my medical records and a full refund as I went directly to Allergan.  They have given me the run around and have ignored me.  Beware! They call him a crook with a license."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"J Joseph Salon is definitely a high quality salon. For a college student like me, the prices are a bit steep, but you get what you pay for! 

I found this salon through Instagram, specifically through the account of their hairstylist Mikayla (@mikcapelo). 

I have seen Mikayla here twice now and she is an absolute hair goddess! She is completely transparent with pricing, her opinion on what you should do with your hair, and will follow exactly what you want done. Both times, I've gone much blonder and she made sure my hair wasn't too dry or damaged. Mikayla is extremely friendly, and makes great conversation while doing great work. 

The salon carries great products for you to purchase as well. I now strictly use the Pureology Hydrate Conditioner. I also use the Pureology purple shampoo to tone. These products are sooo great for dyed hair, especially blonde!  

I have recommended this salon to many of my friends and family, as I had such a great experience. My hair has never looked better!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I've been going to see Dr. Dustin at this clinic for about a year for various aches and pains. Dr. Dustin is the best chiropractor I have ever seen.  His demeanour is extremely friendly and professional. I always feel welcome in the clinic, from the warm feeling greeting room right down to the treatments it's all good.
Most recently I hurt my shoulder skiing, but it only hurt some of the time, so I put off going in.  I couldn't figure out what the problem was, sometimes it would hurt doing innocuous things, and other times I could lift weights and it was fine.  Dr. Dustin was able to diagnose the exact problem and do a treatment on my shoulder.  I gotta give the guy credit if he can diagnose a problem with my body that I couldn't even figure out.
I don't hesitate to recommend this location to my closest friends and family and trust Dr. Dustin and his team to take good care of my body, even when I don't."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"By far one of the best place for massage.  I've had massages many places.  Strong, but not the ""pokey fingers"" that you get elsewhere. (I am ticklish, so strong massage keeps me from giggling-they use elbows, heel of palm and side of hand to apply strong but not painful force) Definitely beats many $$$$ spas! As other reviews have described (some in great detail~thanks!) clothes are kept on, so wear something comfy.  Since you start with you feet soaking in a wonderful little bucket of warm water, be sure your pants are loose enough to roll up to the knee.  Also, they do use lotion when working your neck and feet, so don't wear anything that you may worry about getting lotion on.

I called for an appointment with only an hours notice around 3pm on a a Friday afternoon and had no trouble getting in.

My masseuse checked a couple times to make sure she was not using too much pressure, which I appreciated, as other reviews had said too strong."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"INEXPENSIVE massages by students. After a trigger point massage by Katie I felt floppy and so relaxed. Wow! I was in a room with about 5 massage tables, each with a client and student. Clothes are left on so don't wear jeans. I wore a t-shirt and yoga pants. I didn't think this would be relaxing, but it was!! So much so! And did I mention it was cheap? It's $30 for a massage or $125 for 5 massages! I bought the 5 pack. 

Katie was open to suggestions and when the instructor gave her some tips/direction, she immediately implemented them and continually asked me how the pressure was which is just how I like it. 

If you're looking for a quiet, private, pat-the-kitty massage with cucumber water and ""Zen"" music in the background, this ain't it! That's good for me because I hate spa massages--I like therapeutic, get-the-kinks-out massages. Thanks Katie, great job! I will be back and hope that I luck out with as competent a student practitioner as I did with Katie."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"It's always tough to do a review on a place of business like a tattoo shop...so it's base mostly on the tattoo artist...I can say that this location is very clean, the tattoo artist I've encountered were nice and professional.  JD was my artist (he is amazingly good) he is a true artist; he listens to you and your vision of what you want for your tattoo. His work is truly incredibly detailed and priced very fairly; he is quick, professional, and very personable. I definitely would recommend him to anyone. He made me very aware of the sterilization necessary to not spread bacteria and disease- and going to a licensed ink shop, such as Atomic Tattoos. Friendly reminder: Putting life into a blank canvas, i.e. your skin, make sure it is something meaningful because it will be on you forever. Art is ART!!! Whether it is on canvas or skin- it is objective, not subjective.... So don t let anyone dictate to you what you can or cannot put on your own body!"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I've hesitated writing this review, because I thought it was pretty rude to make a comment about how the other two employees had a bad day. The other two people in the shop seemed nice, and I didn't feel like I was being treated. This is a very unprofessional place and a shame because I was the only one in the shop and didn't feel like I was being treated like a bother. I was there for two hours and it was well worth the price. I'll definitely be going back. I absolutely love this place. I have been going to this salon for over a year now.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"It's very hard to find a professional, affordable, friendly-staffed, very clean nail salon in most parts of Philly, in my opinion. But I'd say this place for the most part is definitely an exception. They are the cleanest and most reasonably priced salon that I've ever been to. They can come off a bit rude sometimes and but I just take it as them being overwhelmed and busy. And I mean sure, there's much nicer nail salons in the city but they're upscale and come with the high prices to match. For the prices Richmond Nails charges, I think you more than get your money's worth. I've been going there pretty much since they opened and highly recommend them for waxing. They give the most on point brazilian waxes I've ever had. They also do great work on nails, very precise with close attention to detail. So even though I've moved from Bridesburg I still travel to see the owner, Tina, for my monthly splurge! Just be prepared for the almost constant lengthy wait times, lol!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I'm Brazilian and my waxing used to be perfect in Brazil. Since I'm in the US I've been trying many different places and always have bad experiences, I was so disappointed that last time I went to a salon I got a horrible bruise with a very unprofessional lady. :(
So I went to European salon the first time and the lady (don't know her name) didn't do a good job either and it was also very painful. But since I didn't know where else to go and I was tired of searching I went to European again but with a different lady this time, Sabah. 
Sabah is GREAT. Since then she's the only I trust to do my Brazilian. She's very competent and removes all the hair, even when there are some ingrown hair she pulls it with the tweezers. She's perfectionist and professional. As any waxing it will be a little painful, but she's very patient and she talks to you while waxing, making you relax and things go easier. I'm glad I found her."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Worst haircut I've ever had. I asked for a fade, explained to the woman cutting my hair what I wanted. What I got was a bowl cut with my hair going from no hair to full hair with a line that was uneven on both sides, as well as jagged on the long side?? It lead me asking myself if the person cutting my hair ever cut hair before or was this their first time? Not to mention they left longer hair around both my ears that made me look like a werewolf with alopecia?? I am not joking. I had to go home and try to fix it myself, and if I do say do...It looked better after I took clippers and a comb to it. Maybe she was blind?? In any event, she should try trenching piano lessons...because she obviously can't cut hair.Now all I have to do is wait a few weeks until my hair grows back so I can go to a real barber and I've them fix it !! Just terrible."

I came here for the first time this week and I'm so glad I did! They were very busy so I was able to make an appointment. I had a male barber named Matt.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Yes, yes, yes!!! Massage Heights is an all around five stars. Right from your first step in the door, you're treated like royalty. The customer service is outstanding, always making sure you have what you need to be comfortable. The massage therapists are incredibly hands on (see what I did there), checking in throughout your massage making sure that the pressure is right, the aromatherapy is keeping you zen and you're fully relaxed during the entire massage. 

At the end of your session, the massage therapists offer up suggestions to keep you loose, tension free and even give you an idea of what you can do next to work out that tough knot in your shoulder or stretch out that tight hamstring.

Heads up, they do try to sell you a membership before you head out the door. The plus side is that they aren't super pushy. They listen to your needs and your budget in order to offer a package that suites you. I didn't end up with a membership but would go back in a heartbeat!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"How this place has so many stars is truly one of the secrets of our vast and mysterious universe. So, I was a walk-in, and as an un-appointmented individual, I understand there will be a wait. Almost TWO HOURS later and after forlornly watching after people who came in after me get served, I was charged about 50 bucks less tip for a half-hearted pedicure and this mangled monstrosity called a manicure. I just kept my mouth shut. At this point, my blood pressure was so high that any verbal communication with another human would have certainly caused a fatal aneurysm, and besides - if they churn out this crapola on the regular, they're sensibly not gonna care if I bring it to their attention. The first thing I did after escaping that place was check myself for MRSA, take a long drag of nicotine,  take a picture of my hands, and post it to a Facebook nail-shaming group because now...now, it was my turn for shame. SHAME, folks. Behold the most shameful manicure in Indy."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I like this place.  Quiet, spacious, the techs seem to be thorough and take their time.  I see Jasmine, she is very good.  Love her attitude and she makes sure I get what I want.  I haven't indulged in the drinking part, but the overall vibe in the salon is positive.  Especially like their attention to cleanliness - they use liners in their foot baths.  After having a planters wart that I  picked up at Beyond Nails in Sparks, this is important to me.  If you've ever had a planters wart, it is painful and unnecessary.  Simple sterilization can prevent these nasty things.  Spraying disinfecting cleaner, and immediately wiping it off and putting in new water for the next person does nothing to kill the HPV virus in the tubs....it takes 10 minutes + for those sprays to work!

Downfall and minus the one star ........when I leave a message to set an appointment (done this 2 times now), no one ever calls me back.  Bad juju."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I first heard of this salon on IG and saw all the great work Sarah did, so I made an appointment. My hair was damaged from a visit to a different salon (the stylist put me under a heating lamp while processing my hair..definitely a no, no) and Sarah managed to save it. The ends of my hair felt like dry hay. :( I told her I wanted to keep the length and color as much as possible, and she was very knowledgeable about Asian hair (and I'm sure all other hairs too). I was very happy with the end result. I was able to run my fingers through my hair without the tangles once again. Yay! I tried booking an appointment for my daughter to have her hair colored by Sarah, but she was all booked up for the month on the weekends. Definitely book early if you want to get your hair done by her on the weekends though. I heard she is mostly free on weekdays (Wednesdays) if you're able to come in then."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love this salon! I have brought both my children here for a few years. After reading the previous comment about the stylist I was completely angry..our stylist is Tracy and she is amazing! Not only does she always remember us by name, but she also remembers details about us and our lives. She truly takes her time and does an excellent job...ALWAYS! I hope she never leaves because it took a few months for us to find her and we want to use her forever! I know that she is not only excellent at her career, but she would never be unprofessional to any customer..no matter what. Sweet n sassy is adorable! It is stylish and they offer specials and coupons on Facebook and on the website. I had my daughters birthday party a few months ago and it was so much fun! They styled her hair, added some glitter and she got to walk on the cat walk. Her friends had a blast! I wish they had a fun place like this for adults! :)"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I called around a few places for a same day appointment and this was the first that was able to accommodate us. This location is nice, right off the highway and nearby a number of other places. The salon is very large, clean, and well maintained. It seems a lot of places have chairs in various states of functionality, but these chairs all appeared to be 100% in working order. We made an appointment at 5pm and arrived a bit early, and luckily they were able to accommodate us immediately. They have a wide variety of high-quality polishes and gel options, and they had an advertisement for SNS powder so I'm assuming they do it there as well. Their prices are slightly steeper than what I'm used to, but I'll gladly pay it for he premium on location, salon maintenance, and color and service selection. My toes look great and I think I may have left 5lbs lighter from all the cuticles and skin she was able to clean up off my feet. Will definitely return here again!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Jimmy was a little too overbearing. I walked in for a mani/pedi and he repeatedly tried to get me to agree to gel polish. I even explained to him that I had it before and wasn't interested due to it damaging my nails. He then told me he would lower the price and asked me two more times if I wanted gel. I finally asked him to stop asking me. I got a regular mani and I soon found out why he was pressuring me for gel. He did such a crappy job that my nails started chipping less then 12 hours later. This was due to his poor filing and paint job. He didn't make sure my nails were all the same length and he never asked if I wanted them trimmed down. After filing my nails, they were still rough and uneven. This led to chipping. I will not be going back. While the prices were fair, I would rather spend a little more for better quality and less pressure to get things I don't want."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I came from LA for the Tucson Gem show. I needed my nails done and I was nervous to try a nail salon out here. I searched a nail salon in Oro Valley and One Day Nail and Spa came up as a recommendation. Mind you, I passed maybe 50 nail salons from Oro Valley but for some reason was determined to check this nail salon out. I'm glad I did! Great service, first and foremost. Clean! They take their tools out of the ultrasonic. You know this by seeing the tools opened from a plastic bag. Most salons don't meet sanitary code!  
  The owner who did my nails was so sweet and she treats her employees like family. Their was jokes and good humor all around the room. Which is rare for a nail salon. More often than not the owner will helicopter employees and there is tension in the room. Not here! In the future when I return to the Gem Show. I will freshen up my nails here."

I will be back. I was looking for a good salon with great service. I was a bit disappointed with the service. I had to wait a bit past my appointment time but I was not able to get an appointment. I came in about 30 minutes before my appointment time to get my hair cut. The stylist who did my hair was not pleasant. She cut my hair and it ended up looking awful. I don't know if she was a new hire but I did have the pleasure of meeting with her. She was nice but she made me feel uncomfortable. My hair was cut down the back of my neck with some sort of comb.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I'm all about ambiance and atmosphere. The staff is friendly and professional. My pedicure was done by two ladies. The owner, Rose, is the sweetest. She is so nice and accommodating. I highly recommend this nail salon. I have been going to this nail salon for years and have never had a bad experience. I have had a lot of pedicures and they are by far the best! I highly recommend it! The prices are reasonable and the staff is very attentive!I had a great experience at this location. I got a Brazilian wax with Jessica and it was a great experience. Jessica is very professional and knows what she is doing. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a new wax place. I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I asked for a little longer but she made it as short as possible."

It was clear she was annoyed about it. I asked for a gel manicure and a gel pedicure and she just brushed it off and didn't even say anything. I didn't get a manicure or pedicure. The tech didn't even ask me if I wanted to pay before my service, so she kept saying, ""I don't want to pay."" I went to get my nails done because I was in a rush and my nails were ready for a wedding. I would never go back here.I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I was a little nervous, but she made me feel so comfortable. She did a great job on"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I originally went there on a recommendation from a friend. I saw a lot of reviews and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I had a very relaxing massage with Amanda and it was amazing! I will definitely be back! I highly recommend Amanda and her entire staff. I love this place! I've been getting my nails done by Anna for over 10 years and she always does a great job. I'm always nervous because I always feel very rushed. Anna is very friendly and takes her time. She's very thorough and does a great job!I'm a student here and have been going to Aveda for over 10 years. I've never had a bad experience here. The students are all very nice and the salon is clean. I've been to other salons in the area and I've never been disappointed.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"If you want a very fast pedicure this will be the best place, my daughter and I got there at 11:00am and got out of there at 11:20am. In my case,I rather relax and enjoy my time while my feet are getting pamper so I will not come back to this place. They did not massage my feet and if they did, it was so fast that I did not even notice. We called ahead to make the app and told me that each pedicure was $20.00(regular)not a problem, but they charge me $45.00, I thought $20.00+$20.00=$40.00,right? And they you tip accordingly, I did not complain because it was only $5.00 more, but I definitely did not like this at all. When my daughter was getting her feet done they asked her if she wanted them to use the callus grinder on her heels, so I guess the $5.00 extra was because they use,instead of a pomes stone, this tool hahaha..... The place is clean and comfy, but does is not enough for me to get back there a"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I went here two years ago looking for a specialist in Keloid growth. Jennifer Parish not only helped it stop growing but removed it .  She has been extremely friendly and patient with me as I asked questions about this weird thing happening to my skin. I was freaked out and she just explained it to me and what the process was.  I found her online because she is supposed to be an expert on the topic.  

I saw her regularly for about a year for treatment before and after it was removed and she has been nothing but helpful.   Even when they were removing the growth, Dr. Parish and her assistant talked me through it because they knew I was nervous.   It's really changed my life in a way.  I lacked confidence, walking around very conscious of this ugly thing on my ear and now, it's a none-issue.  I would recommend her to anyone.  It's worth checking out. That ugly thing is gone and I feel normal again!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Speaking from little experience in salt rooms but this place is amazing. Ambiance is calming and therapeutic with a welcoming feel to it . I want to make a special note  of how friendly the staff is. I am so appreciative of the detailed information that was given. It was so wonderful as well as helpful because she answered all
of my many questions. The salt room was spacious but intimate which felt inviting because of the lighting and placement of the chairs . Wow , so many  benefits of the salt because of antibacterial properties. These minuscule salt particles are things you can feel on your body or in your mouth  from breathing them in while they are blown into the room . I am happy I did this for me .  I'm so willing to invest in my overall wellness . Definitely looking forward  to feeling some improvement with my allergies from the salt room sessions . Soon, I may even try the acupuncture or yoga in the salt room as well ."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I finally made the time to get my nails manicured and I was on a mission to find a nail salon that would take walk-ins after 6:30pm. I initially stopped by a nail salon nearby but strangely they did not have a nail tech on duty who could do acrylic. Strange? They offered me just a simple manicure and I had to decline. Discouraged, I started driving home and surprisingly found Oriental nail. Quickly ran in and immediately saw that it was a packed salon. 7 ladies and 3 nail techs. The odds were against me, especially being so close to closing time. The employees were very quick and said that they could squeeze me in. I waited for maybe 10 mins and I was shortly in a chair getting my nails done. The nail tech was very understanding of what I wanted for my nails and even said ""don't worry about closing, whatever you want we can do"". Great service and very quick. Loved my nails and walked out by 7:30pm. I'll be back for my next fix!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,In Nashville from out of town. The quality of work is exceptional. I have been to multiple different barbers in the area and have been to every one of them. The atmosphere is nice and the staff is very friendly. I will be back. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes before my appointment time and was seated for my manicure. I was seated for my pedicure. When I went to pay the lady who was at the front desk was not helpful. She did not ask me how much I was there for my manicure. She said $10 for a manicure and $10 for a gel manicure. I was shocked at how long my service would take.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I decided to try out this place because it's close to my work and I was excited to try it out.  The place is clean and the staff was friendly.  I was greeted by a very friendly and welcoming woman who was very sweet.  I was greeted by a very sweet lady who said she was taking the time to make sure I was comfortable.  She also asked me about my skin care routine and I told her that I didn't like a lot of products.  She suggested I get my eyebrows waxed.  I said that I was going to just wax them and she told me to go home and do it myself.  I went back to get them done and I was surprised at how quick the process was.  I was told to come back at a later time and she went back to waxing my eyebrows.  I was surprised that the lady was on the
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,This was my first trip here. The woman who did my pedicure did a great job. She took her time and did a great job. The salon is clean and very relaxing. I will definitely come back. I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. I always get a great haircut at the same time. I've had 3 different barbers there and have had a great cut each time. The last one I tried was very rushed. The guy who cut my hair did not seem to know what he was doing. I was just in a rush to get out of there so that was fine. I've had my hair cut in the past and I've never been to a barber shop where you're treated like a child. I will not be coming here again. I have been going to this place since I moved to Tampa from California.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Went today for a fill and gel topcoat. My nails are filed poorly. Some are fine and others are lopsided. Some are very think too. I'm very picky and I find it very hard to communicate with some of the operators which could be the problem. The biggest no no is that they speak to each other in their native language which is annoying. Don't have them do a design. They are not artistic at all. I guess I haven't found my new nail place yet.

I am now stuck for two weeks with a design that was supposed to be a beautiful tree branch with flowers (gave her a picture which she assured me she could do) but got something that my kids say looks like Indian feathers. Don't do designs if you can't paint. 

Back to Akoi I go. It's a little further from me but even though they are Asian they only speak English which is very respectable. Their designs are not to be believed and they also have nail decals for those operators who are not artistic."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Stopped in, without an appointment to get a pedicure.  I was asked to pick my color and was taken right back.  They had a ton of empty chairs so it wasn't busy at all.  Sang did my pedicure.  I told him that my other nail salon always had an hour wait (with an appointment) and that I only get a 30 minute lunch.  Of course, I'm always late returning from ""lunch"" when I go for nails or toes.  From the time I left work (about 10 minutes away) to the time I returned to work, it was exactly one hour.  He gave me a nice foot and leg massage, polish and cut seem perfect and the 5 minute neck massage I got while my toes were drying was fabulous.  I watched others not tip but wth, someone gives you a neck massage, give them a few bucks.  So it was 25.00 for pedicure, 5.00 tip and 2.00 tip for neck massage (would have given 3 if I had another dollar bill)."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was so disappointed with my recent services here.  I had a facial with a very inexperienced esthetician.  She was incapable of doing extractions and her technique was extremely awkward and rigid.  She was very nice though and wanted to be helpful.  Just obviously had no knowledge or experience or understanding of the client.  Not to mention my face is breaking out worse than before. 

I still decided to give the spa another chance with a different service and booked a manicure and pedicure.  The pedicure was fine but the manicure was terrible.  The manicurist (?) had no idea how to use the nail clippers or filer or any other tools and was basically filing my skin rather than my nails.  She took forever painting my nails and it literally was like she had never given a manicure before.

Never again.  I would highly recommend against getting a facial here and if you are getting a manicure make sure to get with someone who has been around for more than a week."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"So happy! It's not easy to find, the staff is very friendly and helpful. I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the best one. They do a great job and are very thorough. I'm a loyal customer for life and I recommend you try them out.I'm so happy I found this place.  I made an appointment for a gel fill.  My nails look amazing and I can't wait to go back!I have been here twice and both times I got my eyebrows threaded. The first time, they were uneven, not shaped well, and the second time, they were crooked and didn't look like they were done properly. I'll be going back and hoping to make an appointment for another threading service.I love coming here! Everyone is super friendly and helpful. My nails look great every time I come. I love the fact that"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Purchased a Groupon for a facial. The woman who did my facial was very sweet and personable. She explained the process and the products she used on me. I had a lot of questions and questions and she answered all of them. The facial was relaxing and relaxing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!I've been to several locations over the years and this is by far the best. I had a very bad experience with the hair stylist and a groupon for a haircut and color. I had a very bad experience with another salon and I was so desperate to find a stylist that could do a good job at listening to what I wanted. I found this place through Groupon and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I had an appointment with Lauren and she did an amazing job! She was very friendly and my hair looked fabulous.
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Went in for a very simple tattoo and the girl who did it did a great job! Very professional and friendly. The place is clean and the staff was friendly. Would definitely recommend!I had an excellent experience at Salon Nails. I had a gel manicure and pedicure. The place was clean and nicely decorated. The woman who did my nails was very nice. I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder/neck massage. I will definitely be back!I've been to this nail salon a couple of times. I'm not sure why I don't give this place more than 5 stars. I went in today for a pedicure and had the worst pedicure I've ever had. The lady who did my pedicure was super rough with my cuticles, she cut my toe with the cuticle cutter and then just left."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"A week after LASIK allowed me to get rid of glasses, my constant companion for twenty years, I wanted to update my hair, too. After lunch in 12 South and a little dessert from Las Paletas, we walked down the sidewalk, where I saw Suite One. 

Erin is new to Nashville, and she is amazing. She asks questions and actually LISTENS to responses. She encouraged me to touch my hair and finger-style it to get a feeling for the cut and color; she kindly tolerated my internal debate about bangs, and she used minimal product - something few stylists do, even when I ask repeatedly.  I have, without a doubt, found my new regular stylist. I've never been happier with a cut.

The salon is bright and cozy at the same time, with warm colors, comfortable couches, styling chairs, and wash bowls. It's comfortable - a place I'd feel equally at ease reading a book in the corner or chatting with the staff. 

In all, the salon - and especially Erin - was a GREAT find. I love my new look!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,My first appointment getting lashes did not go well at all. They didn't provide me with the look that I wanted and I left a review on their yelp page. I was then reached out to promising a full refund and a free full set of lashes if I took down the review. My lashes look better the second time but I did not get my full refund. I paid 95 dollars the first time and only got 79.99 back. The 15 dollars were gratuity. I was asked if I was leaving gratuity the second time before I was leaving and felt very uncomfortable because I'm not one to say no if asked but I had no intention of giving my lash stylist gratuity because I felt that the gratuity I had already given should've gone to the second lash stylist. I will not be going here again but appreciate the effort on their part. I don't think the reviews should be taken down because they help them improve and keep people from wasting their money and time on this place.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I visited 1/19/17. After reading all of the glowing reviews on this place I was pretty excited to visit. The salon is beautiful and the staff is very welcoming and kind but my nails look AWFUL. I asked for a full set, something I get every two weeks (I was in Chesterfield yesterday and didn't have time to drive to my normal shop in Florissant, so I stopped at Bello after visiting Yelp) It took two and half hours, my nails are crooked, and I have cuts on almost all of my fingers. They also kept trying to sell me on this dip polish and offering my all these colors I had no interest in. And it was $70 dollars!!!! I am so disappointed. I went to my nail shop today and paid another $30 to fix my nails. I had to have the polish removed, the nails shaved down and reshaped, and two nails filled because they were BROKEN under the acrylic. $100 manicure from hell  Total waste of time and money, honestly. Even the wine didn't fix it."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,We were in town for a conference and needed a haircut. I found this salon through Yelp. I am very happy I did. The salon itself is very clean and relaxing. The staff is very friendly. The stylists are all very friendly. The staff is always extremely helpful and helpful. I have been getting my hair cut by Jessica for over ten years and she has done a phenomenal job. She is very friendly and always gives great suggestions. I highly recommend this salon. I have been going to Jessica for about a year now and she is fabulous!  She is friendly and does a great job. I have to say that I have found my new salon. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone looking for a new salon. I am so happy I found this place! I was going to a new place and had a terrible experience.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This place is so bad, I will never go back. I came here for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and the lady who did my nails was rushing through it. She was rushing through my manicure. She rushed through it. I had gel on my nails and the gel was a mess. I was going to get a pedicure and I showed her a picture of what I wanted. She tried to charge me for the design because it was so much wrong. She was very rough with my hands and they are very rough with my cuticles. They are uneven and uneven. The color is uneven and the cuticles are not smooth at all. It is disappointing because I paid for this and got a gel manicure. I would not recommend this place to anyone.The worst nail salon I've been to. I went in for a dip manicure and the lady doing my nails"

I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was nice and clean. It's very busy on weekends and they were able to squeeze me in.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I went here after work and really enjoyed it. The staff were very friendly and thorough. I had a pedicure/manicure and the woman took her time and it was a delight! They have massage chairs (not my favorite but it's nice to have them) and lots of magazines throughout. They had a good selection of colors (and new ones) - the only thing I didn't like was that they were all OPI. I'm a big fan of Essie. 

The pedicure and manicure were both very good and thorough and while it's too soon to tell how long they will last, they looked great from the moment I was done. The manicure especially has a nice hard finish. 

It's a good idea to make an appt - I was told to come back in about an hour and half because they were busy - but I was helped as soon as I came back in at the time they suggested. Staff were extremely nice and the price was great - $32 for a mani/pedi. Salon is clean and has a nice water feature."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This salon was very busy but to me that's a good sign. Linda did my pedicure. She was professional and sweet and gentle. I would show y'all a pic of my feet but I got some fugly ass feet just know she did a bomb gel pedicure. Khim did my refill and gel color. Also very professional and friendly. He shaped my nails perfectly and even with the acrylic they feel thinner and less bulky. For those who still get acrylics like me y'all know what I mean. As far as ambiance, it looked and smelled like a nice spa. Very clean with soft colors and smelled like lemongrass. Overall it was a great spa day experience. *1 star deducted because they forgot about my homegirls refill and gel color. We had to remind them she hadn't been seen yet. Also, our first appointment wasn't properly annotated. Luckily we called to confirm, that's when we were told we were not on the list. We still made it in, but just make sure you guys double check your appointment before you get disappointed*"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"100% absolutely horrible. I purchased a groupon that consisted of 40 units... I'm 33 and This was my very first time to ever get Botox. The ""very experienced"" nurse practitioner (Lisa) I think her name is didn't listen to one word I said... My exact words were ""if I don't need all 40 units then I'll be happy with not using them no refund necessary"" But oh no she pumps all 40 into my face (mostly my forehead). Now I'm stuck with saggy skin on my eyelids and nonstop puffiness under my eyes. Yes, I get plenty of sleep and lead a very healthy lifestyle so there's absolutely no reason why my eyes should look like this. Furthermore, my eyes have never looked like this until after my Botox set in. And just to be certain I went and got a second opinion and they agreed I was ""WAY over botoxed"" I have to use my finger to lift up my eyelids so my makeup will look half way decent. So upset so embarrassing. How about listen to your patient next time."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"It saddens me to leave this place and let them know I will not be going back. 

I am very upset I wasted my time and money and money. The owner is nice but she is no longer there. I will never be going back.I've been coming here for about a year now and I can honestly say I never have a better experience. I've been here twice now and each time I've gotten my eyebrows done, they have always been very nice. The first time I went, I was given a $10 off coupon for my first time eyebrow waxing and it was really good. I haven't had a pedicure in over a year and I've had other places and they're all great.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"A few months ago I was looking for a new stylist. After looking at their website I decided to see Nicole. I've gotten a couple nice cuts from her and some highlights. She is a stylist that knows what she is doing and it's nice to be able to trust someone with my hair. Also I like her because although she is friendly, she is not gossipy like some other stylists. 

This place is clean and sharp looking. The only reason I couldn't give a higher rating is that the girl answering the phone is not that great. She doesn't understand what people want and then have to bother the stylist or esthetician and have them call the client back. When running a salon, you need to have good, competent people on the phones. Miscommunication is this kind of work environment gives the potential to lose customers. And it seems that who ever runs the facebook doesn't communicate things with the front desk either. It seems like they just aren't on the same page so that makes it frustrating to deal with them."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I tried this place just by reading reviews and seeing pics they have posted in their facebook page. I was greeted right away by owner Helen, when I walked in. Place is so clean and neat. She told me to wait or come back in 30mins as they were busy with other clients. She noted my details to reserve my place. I am impressed at this part, as most of the other salons dont even care. When I went back, Vincent greeted me and I showed him the picture I want. I asked for a gel mani and flower design on my ring finger, a real flower by the way. His work was very proficient and neat. Helen did the flower part, she showed me couple of varieties they had, and gave an option to select one I like. Lastly she did a mini massage followed by paraffin dip. Even though there are other customers waiting, these people dont rush on compeleting their work fast. I am really impressed with their service, place and everything. Definately this is gonna be my regular place."

I was charged $10 for a pedicure. The tech didn't even scrub my feet before she did my nails. The next day my nail polish started to chip. I was just in a rush to get out of there so I was trying to avoid the inconvenience. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. I will not be returning. I don't think I'll ever be back.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Michelle is a brow GENIUS, there's no other way to put it. I had over-plucked brows from years of less-experienced waxers/threaders ""just evening it out,"" and it was so bad I went all over Santa Barbara looking for someone who could really help. Michelle was the only one who took the time to really figure out my shape.

Unlike at other places, where growing out my brows meant feeling gross for weeks at a time and just suffering through it, Michelle showed me where I needed to let my brows fill in, but I always left feeling like my brows were ""done."" She is the only person I've ever known to do brows so well they look BETTER as the weeks go by. She's truly amazing, I have complete faith in her ability and will never go anywhere else as long as I live here. 

From the bottom of my heart, Michelle, thank you so much! Brows are such a crucial part of your face, and anyone knows that there's nothing like beautiful brows to make you feel pretty and put together. Worth every penny."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"OK but... 

In advance of my cut I told the stylist Sierra, ""I want to be able to run my fingers through the ends and not have tangles,"" ""I don't blow dry ever (because I run/swim every day) so don't blow it out."" Near the end of the cut I noticed that Sierra was holding shearing scissors. Damn! I forgot to tell her not to use them! I asked, ""I understand that shearing scissors cause the hair's ends to fiz out and get tangly and become quickly damaged. She said, ""yeah, they do that."" 

So here's the thing... a great salon won't use shearing scissors on your ends. They know better. Its been a week since my cut and I can't run my fingers through my hair, my fingers get tangled at the ends where she sheared my hair. 

In spite of my request, she also blew my hair out. She said she needed to blow it to finish the cut. OK, I get it, but don't charge me for it. 

My sweetie is getting his hair cut next, I'm recommending a different salon."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I love it here - as long as my guy is available. You may have to try a couple times to see who is right for you. 

$30/hr for a massage. Pretty awesome. And they don't speak full English so you don't have someone talking to you through whole massage (happens to me at other places). Front desk does speak English. 

They did just add 8% charge if you use debit/credit cards even though no ATM on site - though would prob cost same w ATM charge. 

You can call up same day or just show up. I like not having to plan a massage days in advance so that I can go when I'm in the mood. 

It's fully clothed unless you want oil ($5 extra). Separated by others by curtains so not own room but own section. 

It is a foot spa place so half massage is concentrated on feet if choose first option but there are many options. 

Check in on yelp has free hot stone massage. There's also coupon cards for free hot stone though I don't personally prefer them."

I can't wait to go back! Thanks again!I was in town for work and decided to treat myself to a pedicure. I had a wonderful experience."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"First time using the Self Center. Easy to find. Able to find parking. Got to the appointment 10 min early as they suggested but when I got there a sign was up stating it was closed and will reopen at 3:45. Had to stand outside and wait. Good thing it was a beautiful day today. Once I got in, my first impression was small entry way but welcoming staff and quiet environment. Got the paperwork done. Once inside the massage room, very spacious, calming music playing, lighting to compliment mood and a nice scent in the air. The massage bed was heated, which is nice to climb into. The masseuse was wonderful. I needed deep tissue and gave me enough deep pressure to release my tense muscles and worked on the muscles that needed the attention. The best was the hot towels they placed after the back was done and neck . What a wonderful simple thing to make you feel even more relaxed. First experience with the hot towel and totally recommend the self center just for that extra service. Will definitely go back."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I rated this 4-stars because:
*They've always been able to accept me as a walk in. I hate that so many places require a booking for a pedicure. I'm not waiting three days to get a frickin' pedicure. *They have comfortable, massaging chairs and a large TV, so it's a relaxing event. *They take the time to give a good massage. Definitely not the best pedicure foot and leg massages that I've gotten. This is an area where they can improve. But most of them take their time, so that's really awesome. *They're affordable. Some things to improve: swap out the old nail polishes, better massage technique, and make sure everyone has good training. I once got a painting where the nail polish flaked off right away and I knew it was going to happen because she skipped some steps. None of these are a super big deal. I definitely like going here. (My favorite is John. He doesn't cut corners and really makes sure to go through all the steps. He also made a good recommendation for me when I picked out a color/sparkle combo that he knew wouldn't work."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"If I could give zero I would. Dr. Rumer and her staff are very unprofessional and her patient care is unethical. I had a surgery with her 6 months ago and I'm still experiencing complications due to her errors during surgery. Around a month after the surgery I started feeling uncomfortable pain inside the surgery area. It turned out Dr. Rumer didn't take out the sutures and there were couple still inside me where they shouldn't be. Another doctor had to take them out. Also since the surgery I've been experiencing bleeding when I use the bathroom. I've tried contacting Dr. Rumer's office multiple times, but they're awful at getting back to their patients. One thing I wish I did differently was to pay more attention to those negative reviews as my experience with her was as negative as those reviews. Also, cosmetically I'm not happy with my results either. I don't want what to happened to me happen to anyone else. Please do your research. There are better surgeon out there who will do a better job and care about their patients as well."

The salon was beautiful and the staff was very friendly.  I had a great experience.  The decor is a bit too small, but it's a very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I got a wonderful massage here. The woman who worked on my back was very professional and the massage was so relaxing. The place is clean and the staff was friendly. The only thing that I didn't like was that the massage was very short. I was charged for the 30 minute massage and a 20 minute massage. I did get a 60 minute massage and I think that was supposed to be 80 minutes. I felt like I was being ripped off because I was getting a full body massage. I feel like I'm going to have a really bad day and it was not worth it. I will not be returning.I have been going to this salon for years. It is the only salon I go to and I have to say it is the best place in town.  I have been coming here for a few years now.  I have had great experiences.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"After moving to West Philly for graduate school I was nervous about finding a new salon.  I had been going to the same one since I was young where I had only traded between stylists as my personal style changed. And during my undergraduate years I had a few awful cuts at walk in places so I didn't want another repeat experience!!  

Making an appointment was incredibly easy and they even let me pick the day and time rather than just offering me specific options.  The salon itself is very clean and trendy, with rather courteous employees and complimentary refreshments.  I was assigned to a stylist named Kelly for my first visit and I've requested her ever since.  She's young, but great at what she does!!! I've never felt more at ease with a new stylist as I did/ do with her.  She also gave me some great tips and product suggestions for dealing with my impossible thin straight hair.  

As long as I'm living in West Philly, this is where I'll be going for all my salon needs!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This place is amazing. I've drug my feet on writing a review because I don't want the secret to get out! This salon is by far the best nail salon I've ever been to. When I end up at other salons (only happens if I need a last minute appointment and City Nails is booked), I'm inevitably disappointed because I'm so spoiled from this salon. Tyler is amazing!
I feel like I get so much more than my money's worth at this salon. The level of detail that each technician pays attention to is amazing: I leave here with a PERFECT manicure literally every time. It's never a rush job. If there's even a tiny flaw, they'll take the polish off that nail and fix it. I really appreciate that because when I'm shelling out my hard-earned money for a luxury product, I want to be happy about the results. Even apart from the quality of the nail job (which is elite!), the customer service here is also better than any nail salon I've been to. Every technician is so sweet and personable."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I found this wonderful a few years ago. I've been going to a variety of massage therapists and therapists. The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. I go to Rheumatoid and he is amazing. He is very professional and has great technique. I have been to many massage therapists and I can honestly say that he is the best I've been to. He has given me a great deep tissue massage and I always feel very relaxed. I highly recommend him for all your massage needs. I love this place! I have been here a few times, and have always had great service. However, the last time I went in for a full set of acrylics, I was charged $60. I got them done and I had to go back to have them redone. I have no idea how this is supposed to happen, but I was charged $60."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Started off great, but didn't go back because the girl in the front was really rude. I just wanted a gel polish change and I got a regular manicure and pedicure. The massage was good, but the color selection was horrible. There are a few things that I would not recommend. They used the same nail file and buffer on me, and it was a little rough. They didn't put a nail top coat on my hands. It was all a mess, so I went back to get it fixed. The nail tech was really nice, but she did not paint my nails evenly. The color selection is limited. They didn't have the color I picked, and the color I picked was not matching. I also got a gel manicure with a different technician, and it was a different story. I went back to have the polish removed, and the other technician just took off the color and applied the"

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I stopped in here while waiting to go to the movies!  Wanted a manicure and pedicure!  So the guy started on my feet and first he didn't clean under my nails at all, nor get rid of the dead skin at the end of my toes or around My heels!  All he did was a little filing and scrub here and there! It was really bad!  He was in a huge hurry!  I should have known when I heard the ladies walking out saying that was the worst $80 I spent!  They didn't even clean around my nails, they rushed me out!! Crap!! Same with my hands!! The I get up to the counter and he says $106.00!!!! What?? For the crap job I just got done?? Manicure/pedi 53 a piece??  I don't even pay that price at the ritzy place I go to in California??? They do gels to!!! Never ever again!! Buyer beware always ask what is included and how much you get for that?! Will never go back!  Might have to go to  Oceans again!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've never liked a gym as much as this one. I signed up early and got an awesome deal. The staff are so friendly, always greet me, and never make me feel uncomfortable. They're always cleaning, chatting with customers, etc. 

The gym itself is huge with a diverse group of people who go. I usually stop by in the mornings, and after a while you'll recognize the crowd. But the great thing is that no one breathes down your neck, there's no ultra-fit obnoxious gym rats trying to stress you out and talk down to you about your workout, etc. It's a laid-back atmosphere that really encourages you to just let go, and get your body working.

Everything is so clean, even almost a year after they opened! There are so many different machines (and so many of them), and what I love the most is that they have ellipticals with shorter stride, so shorties like me can actually use them and not hurt our poor hips. 

I seriously love going here. I've never actually WANTED to go to a gym more than when I started coming here."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Just had my first mani and pedi at Millenium and I only have one word...WOW. First of all, looking at the outside you would never know how nice it is on the inside. They have what look like the cadillac of pedicure chairs and the place is extremely clean and decorated so nicely. 
I started off with a pedicure and they did a great job. I loved that they took their time and boy do they go all out with the foot and leg massage! I was very impressed. 
The manicure was equally as enjoyable and the back and neck massage was a nice surprise, too! They have a great selection of polishes and the women are friendly but not overly talkative which I tend to like when I'm trying to just relax. 
Overall, it was a great experience and I can honestly say that I won't be going anywhere else. Kinda bummed that I missed the Mon-Wed special where you get a mani and pedi for $35. I paid $45 without tip...definitely worth it so $35 is a total steal!!! 
Can't wait for the next round!"

I had to wait a bit and then the man who did my daughter's nails did a terrible job. He cut me 3 times and it was very painful. He also was rough and was rough. I was going to get a pedicure and I was so upset. I will never go back to this place. I won't be returning. I have been here twice now and have had both my eyebrows waxed. Both times, they were great, the first time, and the second time, they were great. I have not had a bad experience there, but I would recommend going to a different place.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I had my first appt at Mikel's and it was great. Tabby was the stylist I chose after looking through her posted pictures and deciding she could do what I had in mind for my hair. I was very glad I booked with Tabby. She really listened to what I wanted for my hair and it turned out better than I had imagined. The salon itself is really unique in the way it is set up. I really liked it. There is a separate section for color and then you go to a ""lather lounge"" that is like a spa where you get two pampering treatments included in the price of your hair service. All their prices are listed on their website. It's what you would expect for a higher end salon but it lives up to the cost. The staff is highly trained, experienced and from what I understood they have monthly training to stay current on new techniques and trends. I've used a few places for my hair since moving to Tampa a year ago but I've finally found the right place and the right stylist!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Katie is absolutely amazing!  I have very fine hair & have been lead to believe there's not much that could be done to it to make it look fuller.  I've always hated having my hair cut because I leave looking the same & feel disappointed.  Katie did my hair for a wedding & I've never had it look more beautiful, so I decided to see what she could do with some scissors.  She took the time to show me different options for cuts, explaining what each would do to add more volume & fullness.  For the first time in my life I didn't look in the mirror wishing for someone else's hair.  She worked some serious magic, now I have the cutest cut, it's super full in the back & framed perfectly around my face.  The best part is I don't have to do ANYTHING to it, the cut works perfectly with my natural curls!  If you want someone who really loves what they do & really knows how to make you feel good about your hair, GO SEE KATIE!"
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Older lady was rude from the start. I was trying to discuss with her what I had done previously and was interupted by her asking if I just jumped around to different hair dressers.I explained I had just returned from out of state but am still not sure why it was her business. She talked over me, would glare at and reprimanded me when I asked questions. Basically said my hair choices have been wrong and that she would have to cut off at least half of my hair before even coloring it, due to my hair being so bad. Yes I know my color was outgrown and looked bad, um thats why I was there. It was so bad, her beretting me almost had me in tears and I ended up pulling off the drape and walking out. Thankfully I went to a reputable salon that said my hair was normal for having outgrowth and I wasn't treated poorly. Salons should be relaxing and make you feel better, I honestly felt scolded and embarrased when I left. My advice, there are plenty of choices, skip this place."

I will definitely be back!I went to this place because I was in the area and I was in need of a cut and a color. I'm from out of town so I decided to try out a new salon. I was skeptical because I was a little nervous about trying a new stylist but I was not disappointed. I was greeted by the receptionist and offered coffee and water, which I appreciated.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I came here as they were still doing their grand opening hoping this would be my new nail salon after moving to ST Pete. 
I asked for a nail color, 113. It's bright pink. The lady came to me and showed me a similar color to the one i had and claimed it was 113. it was a darker pink with sparkles. She painted it on me. She told me this one is the same one you saw up front. After paid, i realized not only did she give me the wrong color, and i showed her... but she also did a horrible job with the acrylic application. she made it way too thick and looked BEYOND a natural nail. After paying i left. i went outside and realized how horrible my nails were so i went inside and told her. she had NO problem making corrections after the fact. My nails still look like crap honestly but it's a lot better than what it was before. 
thank you for making the corrections but please sharpen on your skills. 
Sad to say but i won't be coming here again."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I've visited a few different eyebrow threading spots during my time in Nashville, but was on the lookout for another place, hoping to find a reliable, reasonably priced salon. I came across  Glitzy Brows on Yelp, and with the number of raving 4-and-5-star reviews, I decided to give them a try.

It was a bit of a drive for me, but I  was up for the adventure. When I arrived, there was only other customer in front of me, so not much of a  wait. The actual process was quick and fairly painless, as eyebrow threading goes. One of the ladies, Alma noticed that I suffer from the terrible affliction known as Thinning Eyebrow, and asked me if I had ever considered eyebrow tinting. I told her I had not, and she asked if I'd like to try it. She sat me back down in the chair, and shaped my  brows and applied the tinted. 15 min later, my eyebrows looked fuller and shapely! 

The pricing is great, and the ladies are friendly. Guess I've got a new threading spot. I'll be sure to be back!!!"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Super clean, very nice staff, HUGE selection of normal polish, gel, and powder/dip options (one of the guys told me they have the biggest powder selection in the area, and I don't doubt it!!). I came to this salon after I saw they definitely could refresh my powder polish (or whatever it's called...) and they also had their price posted online. I have been to many salons in many states, and these ladies and gents were genuinely nice, and didn't awkwardly not speak to me or force conversations, it was all very authentic, like I had known them (and some of the other customers!) for a long time.
All this being said, my nails also came out PERFECT, at a very reasonable price, and I felt no pain at any point in the process- I have some very sensitive cuticles, and had a ton of hang-nails, and everything was addressed with no pain and to perfection! I also got a forearm/hand massage with WARM lotion, which I never experienced before.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I  continually hunt for a good nail place that I can use every month...one that makes me feel like I am valuable, not part of an assembly line...one at which I can establish a rapport with one person who will work with me each time I go and remember my particular needs/wants.  Well, I thought I found that here but it only lasted about a year.

For the second (and last) time, I called to set an appointment, was told a time to be there, then was put off once I did get there.  The last time, it was to be over an hour before I could have my nails done...and I was there when they told me to be there!  

I had a person I relied on and even a backup when they were not available.  I would come about once a month and felt I was generous with tipping...I would consider myself a ""regular"" customer. I guess loyalty doesn't count for much.  

There are so many nail salons to pick from---I found another place that seems to appreciate me more.  We'll see."

Joe Sr., the owner of the salon, called me himself to apologize for the experience and explain what went wrong the first time, then offered to fix my hair himself (free of charge) if I decided to come back. 

I went back and my experience the second time was excellent. Joe took very good care of me and my hair, talking with me thoroughly before deciding on his course of action. He was the only stylist to work on my hair the whole time, and he checked on me frequently as the bleach took effect. The color that came out was a beautiful, ashy, light blonde that I've gotten many compliments on since having it done.

I even got a call two weeks later from the salon making sure I was happy with my hair. Joseph Anthony cares a lot about the satisfaction of their customers, and their customer service is wonderful. It's almost time for me to go back to get my roots done and I'm excited to do so."

She took me to her station where she asked me a little about myself and what i was interested in doing. I showed her a picture of a haircut that i liked, as well as a color. Well, she did exactly that while adding her own personal style in order to compliment my face and skintone. I was very pleased with the outcome and the blowout was amazing. She listened to me carefully and gave me her own opinions, she was very friendly to talk with and her assistant (Deanna?) was also! The only reason i did not give it more stars was the price..i put out a litle over $200 (tip included) for my hair to be cut-shoulder length, full foils, washed and dryed. I did not mind because of the service, and due to the fact i dont treat myself that much. Overall i had a nice experience at High Tech Hair Salon and i will return again in the future."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Update: they are amazing on the phone - very respectful, friendly and accommodating! They have an awesome selection of teas for clients - I had the Vanilla Orchid oolong. They gave me a pot of it (so good!) and they kept topping up my cup during my appointment. Considering the high of my first appointment last time, I was happy to book back - this time for just a color. I wanted something different but it came out a little unsatisfactory to what I had in mind. Maybe it's my hair that doesn't take color easily. I do think the colourist could listen a little more - she was super hyper/talkative. So love the overall energy there but I'm on the fence for now.

November: My boyfriend popped the question the night before and I was not prepared! I needed some grooming asap and emailed Salon Blunt at 10pm. I got a call at 9am the next morning, offering to squeeze me in! I was so ecstatic! I had a cut and color.

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the massage therapists here are not very good. The woman that did my massage was nice, but it was just not relaxing. It was a little awkward for me. I was in a massage room for about 10 minutes before she was done and it felt like she was rushing me out the door. She made me feel like she was rushing me out of the room. I don't know if she was rushing or if she was just rushing me out. I felt like she was rushing me out the door. She was rushing and doing a good job but was doing a lot of steps that were not relaxing. I felt like she was rushing me out. I felt like she was rushing through everything.

She was rude and it was obvious she was in a hurry to get to the next client. I was very disappointed with the service. I will never come back. I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job on the manicure. I will definitely be back. They are clean and professional. I have been coming to this location for a couple of years. I have had the pleasure of going to this location twice a year. I have gone to the location at the old location and have always been pleased with the service. However, the last time I went, I received a gift card from a friend that I was excited to try."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Tan Nguyen (Ricky) gave an outstanding pedicure and gel manicure. I have been visiting different salons as my regular salon became very inconsistent as it grew. I decided to try NV Nails. Wow. Classic, luxury spa level pedi and mani. Ricky gave a complete spa pedicure with full massage, hot towels, lotion and an attention to detail I have missed for a long time. Then he gave the best gel manicure I have had in years. Actually used cuticle oil and scissors which seems to have become a lost art at most salons. No constant grinding with a drill which was a class act. The nail length and shaping were perfect and the gel polish was applied sparingly to avoid the normal overly thick nails I have become accustomed to, but don't like. Unlike most salons who just say, ""see ya"" once the polish is set, Ricky followed through with a real manicure; massage and lotion. the works. What a wonderful surprise. Ricky is a consummate professional, observant, sensitive and well spoken. I'm so glad I decided to try NV Nails."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I tried this place despite the negative reviews, seeing as most reviews were pretty old.  When I asked for a pedicure, I was told to sign in and pick my color. After sitting about eight minutes, I asked how long it would be, and one of the guys working there told me to go back and sit down, had I not asked I wonder how long I would have been waiting there.  The man trimming my nails was slightly aggressive, and I kept hearing the lady next to me saying ""ouch"" and that her nail tech was hurting her as well. I paid $30 for a classic pedicure and the lotion massage was extremely quick, the hot towel was on my legs for a mere 25 seconds tops. After my pedicure was done, I had to ask a different nail tech to clean up the sloppy polish that was on my toes, and the polish on my cuticles. The lady next to me rolled her eyes at me and said ""not a good experience today.""   Overall disappointed, not a very friendly place and they rush through their services."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,I've been going here for years and years to get my eyebrows done and also my natural nails repaired.  the lady that used to do them by the name of Anna left to open her own shop and then I started working with Judy. She left to open her own shop as well.  Now I come in here today after about 2 months or so and its not the same. I sat there for 20 minutes waiting for someone to do my eyebrows as they serviced other people that came in after me without appointments. The young guy sitting at the first table said he was going to do my eyebrows but I later found out by one of the other technicians that he was joking. She said he does not do eyebrows. Now my only choice is to let the lady that jacked up my eyebrows and my nails before do them again. Of course I refused. But no one else would do them. Needless to say I walked out. Its really sad that now I have to stop going to this place after almost 10 years of business!
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"me and my friend went here for the first time. I saw a lot of people getting pedicures so we had to wait a bit. The lady who did mine was very nice and did a great job. She even gave us a sample of water and water to drink. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they had a lot of pedicure stations. They didn't have a lot of colors to choose from. However, it was well worth the price. 

The only downside is they have a lot of color options. I had to wait a little longer than I would like but that was fine. Overall, I would recommend this place for a pedicure and manicure.I went to see Mary for my wedding hair and makeup for my wedding. Mary was absolutely amazing.

Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"Awful experience. I saw Dr. Priest (another Dr in the practice) She barely looked at my skin. The Dr. her assistant and an arithmetician were all in the room, talking with backs turned to me. Dictating scripts to be written and suggested products. I think the Dr was in the room for a total of 5 minutes. 

I came in because I noticed my acne had changed. She didn't ask me any questions about a change in routine, or makeup. Nothing. It was as if I wasn't even in the room. Just a basic acne patient being prescribed the same stuff she always gives.

I am waiting for a call back from the office. I refuse to pay another co pay and refuse to see the same doctor. If they will waive the co pay, I will see another doctor. Otherwise I refuse to go back.

Overall horrible experience


EDIT: Dr. Priest called me back personally. Although I really didn't get an apology, she did take time to go over everything with me. I will most likely begin my medications and go back in 6-8 weeks only because I desperately want my acne to clear up"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"So there's this place that exists on Magazine St where just walking inside, you'll instantly grow hair on your chest and feel like chopping down a tree. Yes, you heard me! 

Aidan Gill is a speciality store dedicated to the manliest of men that is completely stocked with various items to help you become a proper gentleman. A wide range of shavers, brushes, creams, & shaving accessories to keep your facial hair inline. 

There is also an incredibly wide range of colognes available that'll you make you smell like a gentleman in no time. There's also a nice variety of accessories including bow ties, regular ties, socks, cuff links, and much more. 

I noticed there's also a barbershop set up out back but I saw no one there so I'm unsure if it is still in operation. Would be a brilliant touch if it was! 

The only downside to the store is that it is a bit pricey. I would've love to made a purchase but they were just out of my price range. 

Definitely worth checking out it you're after a gift for a dad, brother, grandfather, or just any male friend."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I had booked a waxing appointment over the phone 6 days prior to my appointment, and when I showed up to my appointment they didn't seem to find me in the system and were confused who my appointment was with but told me someone would come take care of me. After waiting for 5 minutes, the girl tells me that their wax machine was broken and asks if I'd like to reschedule. I find it very strange that they had my phone number (as I received two text confirmations) yet did not bother to call me ahead of time to tell me that the wax machine was broken before I showed up. They also did not tell me when I checked in initially that the machine wasn't working. Having previous experience working at a salon, usually a salon will offer a complementary or discounted service if something like this were to ever happen, yet they didn't do that or even apologize to me. I'm very disappointed because I had high hopes for this salon, and thought it looked like a very cute salon. However, after this poor experience, I likely won't be returning."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This is my 4th time here. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the one girl who did my nails was nice, but the other lady was not so great.I have been going to this salon for a few years now. I have been to two different nail salons and have never had a bad experience. I have had my nails done by a different person each time and my nails have never been as good as the first time. I always feel very rushed. The manicures are sloppy and the polish is sloppy. I am very disappointed with my experience here.I had a great experience at this salon.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"My fiancé and I came here for the first time. We were both happy with the service and the atmosphere. The woman who did our pedicure was very nice and did a great job. They had a great selection of colors, they had a huge selection of gel colors and the place was very clean. They also do waxing which was great and relaxing. I will definitely be back!I went there to get a pedicure. The girl who did my pedicure was very rough and rough. I was so upset. I told her I was going to just get a polish change, and she continued to massage my legs, not only with my feet but with the hot stones. I would never go back to this place again. I would never recommend this place.Worst nail salon experience I've ever had. I went in for a dip powder manicure and was given a horrible attitude. I was offered water, soda, or water,"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Updated Review: I'm extremely unhappy with my visit. First of all, I didn't get a massage. Second, I had a gift certificate for a massage that was not only a gift certificate but it was a gift certificate. Second, I was charged for the service I received. The manager said she was sorry but I was going to have to pay $100-$100 for the service. I was very upset. When I went to pay, she told me that I could not use the gift certificate for the massage because I was having a gift certificate. This is clearly not the case here. I went to get a massage for $100 and it was only $30. It was the worst massage I've ever received. I will never go back here again.I've been going to this location for years now. I have been looking for a new place to get my nails done. I have tried other places in the area but I will not be returning."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I came for my nails because I wanted to stay downtown. The shellac on my fingers was good -- I love the color selection and appreciated her patience when I changed colors halfway through, but the stylist didn't buff my nails as much as I'm used to because she said it helps the shellac, but this caused some flaws in the polish that I watched her try to paint over. Sometimes it succeeded; other times, not so much. 
My pedicure was easy -- they provide a lot in the basic service: massage, sugar scrub, essential oils, hot towel wrap, etc. My feet are a little dry still but my toes look great. 
The drawback was how long everything took. I got there at 1:30 and didn't leave until 4. Part of this was because I changed my mind about my nail color, and because the mani/pedi were done separately by the same person. Most salons have two people working on you at once for efficiency, but this is a hair salon first with the nail salon as an afterthought. I should have bowed out after the mani so I could have kept my afternoon."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"After visiting this nail salon several times and leaving satisfied, I had dubbed it decent-- they don't have a wide variety of nail colors though, so this evening I went and bought a new nailpolish and brought it with me to get a manicure/pedicure. I sat in the massage chair for 1 hour and 45 minutes (not including drying time), my back actually started to hurt! It's unbelievable how much time i spent in that chair with two people working on me. It's also very uncomfortable to twist around and hold your arm extended in the air so that the 2nd manicurist can conveniently do your manicure at the same time as your pedicure. I understand removing polish and getting things started on my nails while i'm just sitting there but don't do my color and topcoat while my hand is all sideways and you can't even properly cover the nail with an even coat. End result: The girl who did my pedicure did a good job, but my nails look lumpy, like they used too much nail polish trying to get it right. I could have done a better job. Not going back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I needed to get my nose ring out back in after having to take it out for surgery. I was nervous as I didn't want to get it re-pierced. The receptionist was very helpful in helping me choose jewelry. She also was spot on in helping me not get a parking ticket as street parking in the area was horrendous! 

After a brief 15 min wait, it was on a Saturday morning, I was seen by John. Firstly, the shop is super clean. John spent time explaining what he planned to do to see if my nose hole was still opened. He asked every time he was going to touch me and was very detailed in explaining the process and how he was going to touch me. I thought this was VERY important! This guy knows consent!

Needless to say the procedure was painless and easy! He talked to me about care and recommend some spray that they sell in the shop!

Lastly, John  and the rest of the staff were really NICE! The conversation was great and everyone was super helpful. 

If I decide to get poked again, I'll definitely travel to see John!"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Long story short... I have been to this salon for color and cut 5 or 6 times. Always very pleased! In fact they even colored my hair for my wedding day! 
I moved a bit further away so I had a cut by someone else and it turned out pretty bad! I let it grow out a whole lot and went to Kevin for him to cut it and I also had it colored which turned out just ok. That is what the 2 stars are for. Kevin asked me "" what do I dislike about my hair""? I said "" there are entirely too many layers""! I showed him a cut I loved on Pinterest. So what did he do? HE PUT EVEN SHORTER AND EVEN MORE LAYERS IN MY HAIR! I was almost crying. He basically gave me a mullet. So I had him chop off like SEVEN inches of my hair bc he DESTROYED my hair. I am still pissed 5 months later. I still can't believe I paid for that cut and color. And I tipped them! Ugh. NEVER AGAIN! Maybe by 2019 I'll have my long, thick, amazing hair again."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"First a  few good points...its easy to find, no appointment is needed, the pricing is reasonable, the process is quick and the facility is clean.

I've had my brows threaded before and its less painful and messy than waxing. However, today, I walked out in tears as my brows are non-existent. I will be drawing them in for the next 2 months. If I could rate less than a star, I would.

I let the technician know I was growing them out, that I liked a full brow and to not take anything off, rather, just clean them up. I have no eyebrows left and when I asked what I could have done to explain what I wanted more clearly, there was no answer. I recommended that in the future, if a client says they want thick brows it would be better to take off less, and if the client wanted more taken off, that could be addressed. But by taking off too much, there isn't a ""fix"" for that. Her response was, I don't understand. So, if you value your brows and don't want to draw them in for several months, do NOT go here."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This salon is great! I needed somewhere to go on a short notice, because a salon I had an appointment with was incredibly inadequate. I called 1329 Salon and Spa, and they were able to set an appointment for me right away. I've been getting my hair dyed for a couple of years now, and it is a big job. I have about 4-5 different colors in my hair. I got Emily, and she was sooo kind, and talented. Unlike the other salon I went to, she and her co-workers were able to detect the pattern in my hair from my previous hair colorist, and was able to work with it. She took some time to learn what I wanted, and how to get there. I'd give this work an -A, because the color ratio wasn't exactly what I wanted: I ended up with not as much red as I had asked for. (For almost $300, I want what I asked for. ) Nevertheless, my hair came out beautiful, well blended, and very soft. It's been about two days in the rain and my hair still feels like I just left the salon."

I have had acrylic nails done at other places and they are all very good.  The staff is always friendly.  They have the most beautiful nail stations.  They are very clean and the staff is very professional.  I highly recommend this place.  I have tried several other places around town and have never been disappointed.  The staff is very nice and welcoming.  They are always very welcoming and always have a smile on their face.  I have gone to other salons and they all have done a great job.

She's a sweetheart and very knowledgeable. She also makes the whole experience fun. I had a fabulous, relaxing massage by her and she was great. The place is beautiful and quiet. I will be back. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut with a different stylist. The color turned out ok, but I was disappointed with the cut. My hair was really long and I asked for a short bob and some round layers. I showed her a picture of what I wanted, and she told me that she could do a different style. I showed her a picture of what I wanted, and she was going to cut my hair down to a bob, but not the same length."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"A mani/pedi at Azul is worth the few extra dollars that you might pay when compared to some other nail salons in the area. My technician, who's name I'm ashamed to say I can't remember, did a fantastic job and was super pleasant to talk to. 

The cleanliness in this place is top notch- a fresh nail kit for each customer (which you get to take home with you), a clean bowl of water for each foot soak, and formaldehyde free nail polish options. Speaking of the polish, the color options are bountiful and they do offer gel if that's what you're after.

A few things to look out for- Certain polishes cost a bit extra. The shelves are labeled, but I could see how the signs would be easy to miss. And the biggest issue I encountered was that they don't allow you to tip on a credit card! I ended up driving to the bank for cash and then all the way back to tip my tech, but I imagine they miss out on quite a bit of money because of this, which seems really unfair to the employees. 

TL;DR Go here, but bring cash!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been to this salon to get an updo and waxing and have left content. I went back two weeks ago for another updo and left so upset. It looked NOTHING like the picture I showed. The stylist said several times that I had such long and thick hair, but this has never been a problem before.  I have had beautiful styles done in the past and paid less! I hate to be difficult and complain, so I tried to make the best of it, but was even more frustrated when the other ladies who worked there said it looked great. Another reviewer mentioned this and yes, it made me almost want to scream. It was a pile of hair this way and that, not all all what I asked for, it did not ""look great.""  The salon is so close to my home so it is so convenient to walk to and I am disappointed to say that I will not be going back. The stylist was very nice, but if a customer is going to pay, you should be honest if a service is above your level of training or expertise."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Fantastic haircut by Rachel for only $50. By far the most attentive stylist I've ever been to - I cannot thank her enough, or recommend this salon more emphatically!

Salon itself is very chic, clean, and makes you feel beautiful just walking in. Everyone is friendly and chatty and obviously loves what they are doing.

Sat down and discussed the thickness, movement, body, and texture of my hair, and how I normally style it. I emphasized that I am growing my hair out, and only needed a trim to shape things up. As Rachel cut, she was conservative and methodical - as she said, we can cut, but we can't put it back, so better to work slowly and carefully to achieve exactly the style I wanted. Midway through the cut, she blew my hair dry, and did the detail work on dry locks. We continually took out a mirror to check on how things were looking in the back, and made minor tweaks here and there. The cut lasted 1 hour and she was never distracted. Now, my hair looks beautiful blown out and air-dried and I've gotten tons of compliments in just the past 24 hours."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been trying to find my new go to nail salon since moving and I think that Apple Nail Spa will definitely be it! Their hours are convenient, they're open until 7:30pm on week nights which is nice if you want to stop in after work. I went on a Saturday afternoon without an appointment and I was taken right away. They keep track of your services/visits on the iPad you sign in on. It's nice to not have yet another punch card to hold onto and hope you have it with you when you're at the place. 

The place itself was pretty large, and it was definitely clean! They have single use tools that are opened for your specific service. I got the spa pedicure and it was $35. I found this reasonable and it included things that usually cost a lot more at other places (hot stone massage, callus remove) etc. I also got the dip powder manicure which was $35. This is the normal price of dip powders in the area. I found that they had a large selection of colors to choose from. 

I'll definitely be making this my new regular place!"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I continue to give classy another try because I am a forgiving person but today was the last experience I will have here. To start, my lady didn't care what so ever about how she was caring for my nails. She filed them so hard with the electric file that I literally had to pull my hand away and screeched ""ouch!!"". I loved my colors but my she made my nails so thick and uneven it will make my hair get caught when they grow out. She also told us we couldn't use gel paint over the sns dip base when I know for a fact you can when other salons in Tucson do it with no issue. NOT TO MENTION my nail is super glued to my skin and stuck. At the end.. our price increased dramatically for these ""$5"" extra charges that they didn't mention and blamed the host for being new and not knowing.. what kind of excuse is that for customer service? I don't appreciate being taken advantage of and being absolutely disappointed. We didn't get lotion and had to ask for cuticle oil. Overall bad experience and we will not be back."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Vague cancellation policy. Received a gift card for this place as a gift from my husband. I had no idea they required a credit card to make an appt. My husband used his credit card to schedule an appt. for me. After my appt I was pressured into making an appt. for a month and a half later. I forgot all about the appt and the day of the appt I received a call from Woodhouse stating that I had two appts and would be charged the full amount for each appt for not showing up. I had no idea and asked how would I be charged as my first appt was made on a gift card and they informed me that my initial appt was secured with my husbands credit card although he purchased a giftcard. Needless to say he now has two charges on his credit card for services I did not receive. Buyers beware, I Would not recommend this place to anyone as I know 2 others that were considering this place and one other person with a gift card. I told her to sell it on Craigslist and don't even waste her time"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Extremely unprofessional! My really good friend was treated horribly yesterday by a staff member! It got so bad that my friend had left from being serviced and the staff member's mother approached her outside because her daughter had called her! My friend is one of the kindest, generous and has nothing but love in her heart! To be treated this way and to be approached outside, especially in the climate we are living in today, is unacceptable! With that being said, first of all, I would have called the police on the mother! You will never approach me anywhere! There is a lot of craziness going on! Her daughter was extremely unprofessional, loud, rude and just took this whole situation to another level due to the fact they needed to leave by 5pm! The appointment is a hour appointment and she rudely told my friend, she will only get 45 minutes with the technician and my friend had already paid in advance for her 1 hour appointment! To say that I am angry today is an Understatement!!! There will be a part two of this review!!! I had to select one star in order to post this!"

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. 

I have had great experiences with the staff and I can't imagine going anywhere else.I have been going to this salon for about 5 years.  I have never had a bad experience.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I always get a pedicure and it is always clean.  It's very convenient to have a spot in the area where the nail techs are very professional and know how to make sure your nails are looking good.  I have had some bad experiences in other salons and this is the only place that will take care of my nails.  I would recommend them to anyone!This is my favorite nail salon!

Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I was five or 10 minutes late and the girl at the front desk was just about to leave. I had an appointment and I waited.  The lady who did my pedi was nice, however, she rushed through the whole process. I asked if she could do the gel polish and she said no. I was going to get a pedi and a pedi. I asked if she was doing the pedi and she said yes.  I asked if she was doing the gel manicure and she said no, so I asked if she was doing it.  I was very upset with the service.  I asked if she was going to put my feet in a bowl, but I did not get to pick my feet up.  I walked out to pay and it was $10 more than the $30 pedi I got.  My friend who was getting her nails done was very upset with the service she received. I asked if she was going to tip her."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I am so happy that I found this place! I've been going to this salon since they opened.  I had a fabulous experience.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The salon was clean and the decor is beautiful.  I was greeted with a smile and a smile.  I had a manicure and pedicure and I loved it.  I also got a gel manicure.  I chose the regular polish.  I have a hard time deciding if I want to upgrade to the regular polish.  I liked the fact that it was not just regular polish but gel.  They also offer a rewards program.  I can't wait to return for another manicure.I'm new to the area and was looking for a new salon. I had a great experience with my stylist, Gia. She was very friendly and did a great job. She was very friendly and friendly. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants a great haircut."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"One random night a few months ago, I suddenly got a ""let's chop off all of my hair"" mood, and of course wanted it to be done immediately. So, since my regular hair dresser wouldn't be available till the following week, and I am impatient, I decided to look up hair salons near me. That is when I stumbled upon Bad Hair Day. 

I made my appointment for the next day, and when I entered the salon, I was the only person there. That actually ended up being very nice because I didn't feel like my hairdresser was rushed to get me in and out. And to be honest, she did a great job, I was very happy with the results. I think it's a great place to go to if you want, or need, a haircut within the next day. I don't think I'd visit again, unless it was another ""let's chop off my hair"" idea. 

The only downside I experienced was the woman not introducing herself, because I do not remember her name at all, which I saw another reviewer said as well. However, she was very sweet and made great conversations, which was a plus."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Really love this salon! We spent some time in old city / Penns landing during the 4th of July weekend.  My friend and her beau were visiting from out of town ... And when our male counterparts decided to  pop into Buffalo Billiards for a round or two of pool ... Ashley and I knew we had to find a more female friendly equivalent!   After trekking through parts of old city and south street only to find most salons closed on the 5th of July (who knew?!?), we turned to yelp in search for a 5 star salon for a mani / pedi!

Alas we found cure and called to tell them we were in route!  They were able to accommodate us immediately, as they were just finishing up another client.  Cute little tucked away salon, professional stylists (engaging, but didn't talk our heads off or try to tack on extra services i.e. ""Gel is much better"" or ""you sure you don't want your brows waxed?"") who can execute flawless polish jobs!!! So pleased at my mani/pedi!  Adding this to my short list of favorite salons and I will certainly be back!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I was in Nashville last weekend for a girls trip and Sensation is great at accommodating groups as they have plenty of room and technicians. The place was clean and serene like I expected and the front staff was very nice. Here's where my concerns are and why I'm rating it so low. Of the 7 girls that had appointments, 5 of us had the same experiences below. The massage therapists do not know how to drape you while you are being massaged. So butt crack - but I can get passed that. My biggest concern is the lack of privacy/security. Someone walked into the rooms while we were face down on the table being massaged. No one should enter the room besides yourself and your masseuse. Also, my masseuse left the room 3 times during my massage, left the drapes as they were and didn't shut the door. I spoke with the owner at the front desk afterwards and she did not seem to understand why it was an issue and why I was upset. Add all that together and the fact that my massage with Faye wasn't even good, I don't recommend this place at all."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"After watching a pile of magazines on the wall, you know how to make a reservation! 

I am very happy with my visit to get a Brazilian Wax. The staff is very friendly and professional. I will be back for sure. I have been to this salon twice now and I have to say I love the way it looks. The salon is clean and modern. They use a modern look, with lots of different colors to choose from. The prices are very reasonable. The manicures are great, and the manicures are reasonably priced. I have gotten dip manicures and pedicures and have never had a bad experience. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I have never had a bad experience. It is close to my work and I had an appointment. I also went in the next day for a gel manicure. I wasn't sure if they had time to do the dip manicure, but it was pretty quick and efficient."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I have been going to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk. The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly. The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language. I have been going to this nail salon for over a year now and I am really happy with the service and the quality of the work. It is a very good place for a pedicure and manicure. I only go to them because it is convenient. I have also tried the gel polish and my nails have never chipped. They always last me a while. I recommend this place to anyone.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I was disappointed in my visit. The woman who did my pedicure did a decent job. I had a very bad experience, but I figured I would try this place out again. I came in on a Monday and I was helped right away. I got a gel manicure with gel polish. I was offered a drink and I had a good experience. I was seated immediately. I was offered a drink and a nice shoulder and shoulder massage. I will definitely be back.I've been to this nail salon a couple times now and I'm not impressed with the service. The last time I went in for a pedicure, the lady cut my big toe. I was bleeding and bleeding. Then the next day my big toe was bleeding. My cuticles were bleeding and I was bleeding. I called the manager to complain and she said she would fix it. I was on vacation and had to come back the next day to get it fixed. I went back in and they"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Came here with a girlfriend, she had gotten groupons for us both, it was a great deal. And only $10 more for gel nails. The actual place is gorgeous, clean and uncluttered. The pedicure chairs are really comfortable. The foot/leg massage was really nice. I do have some mixed feelings about this place though. I have ingrown toenails and usually when I get a pedicure they notice immediately and ask if I want to have them trimmed and shaped. This did not happen at all here. Also I usually get my heels worked on a lot because I have a lot of dead skin and hard heels. Again they didn't work very hard on my heels. The whole experience seems to be much more about the nail colour than the actual pedicure. So far I'm really happy with my gel nails. The had some neat cat eye colours. I think I'd come back for my hprobably not for my feet. 

Update: Well it's only been 5 days and my shellac nails have already started to chip. Very disappointing. I usually have these type of nails last for at least 2-4 weeks. I don't think I'd come back here now."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Please note I have not gotten my hair done here I am just reviewing the conversation I had with the someone over the phone. I called in reference to the Groupon they currently have for a haircut, partial color and condition. I told her I need an evening appointment and she said she doesn't have any. I said I'm not in a hurry to get my hair done so I would take her first available evening and she said she had none. I said I would do March or April and she said she is full. Maybe business is booming and they don't need my money but from my experience businesses in need of customers use Groupon.

Also read the Groupon fine print before buying. It's only for hair to shoulders. She most likely didn't want to make me an appointment because I told her my hair was an ONE INCH past shoulder. She explained I would have to pay more than the Groupon price which I said I was totally fine with yet she still wouldn't schedule me the first available evening appointment.

VERY rude and VERY unprofessional. I would never tell anyone to go here based on my interaction."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I would encourage everyone who had a bad first experience to go back and give Tulip another try. My mom and I have been going to Tulip for about two years. The owner is WONDERFUL and very concerned with the quality of their work and customer service. The space is beautiful and decorated so well. It's not cheap or tacky like every other nail salon. Sure, I prefer some nail techs over others and yes, sometimes employees have bad days JUST LIKE WE DO but I always leave happy, calm, and satisfied with what we pay for. They get super busy so don't expect to get service as soon as you walk in. They're busy because they're good. Almost every time I go I see customers flip out because there's a wait. Calm down, y'all! Quit being so rude to these wonderful people. It's worth the wait. Christian and Lynn are my favorites here and never disappoint. If you had a bad experience, you might have been the issue or you came on an off day. Give them another shot. I just moved back to Hermitage and am so excited to start going back.

Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I have actually went here several times and have even taken my daughter with me. The first couple of times were good nothing special but the ladies were nice enough.  After that it went to mediocre to I just can't justify going any more after my last visit. There would always be some issue with either nails cut wrong, polish crooked, feet still rough or some of each. The last visit though was just terrible and uncomfortable. As soon as I was sat the lady put my feet in the water then instantly started working on them. She was horrible!  My cuticles were not touched, my feet were still rough, she used no lotion and then walked away after putting on a clear coat. After more than five minutes another lady walked buy asking if I wanted color, yes the bottle was right there. The polish is crooked. I literally could have done better myself. The low was the uncomfortable atmosphere after another customer had issues with her service and the ladies instantly began speaking in another language. Felt and seemed highly inappropriate. 

I will never go here again nor would I recommend anyone else to go here."
Beauty & Spas,1.0,OR,"I am only giving 1 star because I could not give zero. I purchased two one hour massages via a wag jag deal and attempted to redeem them for an appointment today (Oct 15) as a romantic birthday gift for my spouse. As their scheduling system is not easy to navigate, I confirmed with a rep from the company that my appointment had in fact been scheduled. It is marked as ""called"" (confirmed) on their website and I also received a reply from their company that it had been properly scheduled. So basically I had TWO confirmations (so the guy who wrote below from the company who basically blames purchaser incompetence for the scheduling errors is clearly wrong). As most of the reviews show (yes, I should have checked the reviews previously but wag jag usually does their research and I trusted them), I had a no-show and absolutely no contact. So the birthday surprise was ruined, and by the time I knew that I had been scammed it was too late to do anything else. I have never been so disgusted at a company's customer service before in my life. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! IT IS A SCAM!!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I havent had good luck finding a good nail place for a basic mani/pedi in TV.  I heard of 2Q from a friend and decided to give them a try. I have tried to get an appt on Thur‐Sat but they are usually busy. On this holiday Mon. I was able to make an appt. The salon is on Ten Mile (walmart center) and behind the SBucks.  The salon has 10 spa chairs and 8 stations for nails. Lots of staff on this day and all were kind and friendly.  2Q was so much cleaner than some of the places i have been to.    I got a basic mani and pedi and polish on toes only. The specialist who took care or me was gentle and gave long  arm/)leg massages. For my manicure I like a short cut which is better for cooking and she shaped them beautifully with no jagged edges and my cuticle beds look so nice.  My Pedi was great i always bring my own polish (I always recommend this).  I will definitely be back and recommend always plan ahead and call them ahead to make an appt.
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"I didn't have any problem scheduling.  Called on a Friday and got in on Saturday.  The salon itself was decent.  It could stand a good cleaning but for the price you can't beat it.  

My hair turned out great.  Went in looking for just a cut, but really needed some highlights.  They were able to accommodate and did a great job.  

The massage was decent.  The room is rather small and nowhere to put your clothes etc.  But again, I can overlook it for the value.  Just don't go expecting a high end salon. 

The facial was just ok.  It was only 30 mins and consisted of cleansing, exfoliation, and a mask.  No extraction, anti-aging etc.  I will probably go with the pedicure next time.  They only have two pedi chairs so probably not good for a group.  The two chairs they have look nice. Massaging etc. 

Overall, I was happy and would recommend          However, if you are looking for a special occasion place such as your wedding or a luxury spa, I would keep looking."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Walked into this shop the woman behind the counter was very rude and unprofessional. She was rude and did not speak very good English, which is why I was there. She cut me twice with the electric file and when I said it was hurting she then proceeded to tell me that I was getting a gel manicure. I did not want the gel manicure to chip so I asked her to just put the nail polish on. I asked her if she could remove the gel and she said it was gel. I told her no. I asked her to just remove the gel polish and she continued to paint my nails. She said yes and it was gel. I told her no and she continued to paint my nails.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Service has suffered a bit as clientele has increased.  Most of the technicians I've  seen are great- efficient,  skilled,  attentive and kind.  Unfortunately it always feels a little crazed when i walk in... whoever is behind the desk is almost always on the phone answering calls before assisting clients in the room, and overall i generally feel like my satisfaction is less of a priority until I'm actually in the waxing  room.  While the paper is always fresh and they never double dip  sticks,  the room doesn't ever feel super clean.  I'm  no germaphobe, but i don't  want to see stray wax spatter on the walls and dust clumps on the floor. 

The waxings i get monthly are always good enough (and so affordable  with  my peach  card) that I'll continue to return.  I got a facial once as well and found it to be incredibly soothing.  Definitely more about the relaxing experience than specific skin issues,  but very enjoyable. 

Bottom line: maybe not the ultimate waxing boutique it would like to be,  but good service for a girl on a budget."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"One word:  DAVID! I would special request him.  He is calm, focused, and truly gave a deep tissue massage without me feeling bruised the next day (as has happened with other masseuses in town).  The front desk person seemed either side tracked, or annoyed that she had to help me. She was not rude, just not seemingly pleased to help me.  I would go again just for the expertise of David and the fact that my neck and back pain subsided tremendously. The inside is actually really tranquil and aesthetically pleasing.  Super cute back patio to relax in as well if needed.
I inquired about having some friends come together for a spa day.  The front desk person explained we could order drinks and a cheese platter.  When I explained we are all vegan and would like a vegan platter, she seemed confused and said she would ask the manager if it was possible.  In 2019, in Santa Barbara, in California, vegan options should really be the norm and an establishment should be ready for this request.  David is 5 stars, but the other things mentioned are making my initial experience a 4."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Sadly, I was very disappointed in my manicure and pedicure at the spa. The group I was with had all very different experiences, it was very inconsistent. My nail chipped less than 24 hours after getting my manicure and I got the gel manicure. For the pedicure she cut the nails so short they are raw and I am unable to wear closed toed shoes due to the pressure put on my big toes. I have an ingrown nail that caused my toe to become swollen and highly sensitive. (luckily my nail lady from home was able to get me in today to help me!) The other areas of the spa were very nice though no one pointed out where the Relaxation room was and we found it half way through our day. If you go bring your own slippers! They provide extremely uncomfortable rubber sandals that are very hard to walk in. My nail tech was clearly new so hopefully it gets better but traveling from 4.5 hours away I was disappointed for the results after the price I paid. I was intending on bringing a bridal shower there but I will have to try a different spa in Reno."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love how sweet the girls are here at Air-Tan! They always answer any questions I have and I can tell they really care about their customers. The actual tan lasts around a week and a half to two weeks depending on how well I take care of it (exfoliating before, moisturizing, etc) and has really nice olive undertones so I never end up with yellow/orange tints. 

I used to use harsh chemical-based self tanners, or would use tanning beds 3-4 times a week until my mom was diagnosed with skin cancer. I started asking around and a friend referred me to air tan because of their organic and organic plus solution options. This sold it for me. Knowing I'm keeping harsh chemicals off my body and still looking tan year round has made me a forever customer of Air Tan!

This location has parking behind the building which is nice now that the street in front had the Red Line bus station put in, eliminating front street parking. Super easy and free to park behind the building, a pro-tip an employee shared with me that I wouldn't have known before.

The appointment was very easy to make, and it's always refreshing to have a front desk staff that is super responsive.  I made an appointment with Jerry, and let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, he is a magician with hair.  I have curly, kinky, frizzy hair naturally, and he tamed that beast.  They use Redken products, which I haven't used in awhile, but am now switching back.  He twisted, and clipped my hair, in a way I knew I could never do myself.  After he took the clips out, and combed out my hair, I was speechless (which if you knew me, never happens!)  My hair looked amazing!  It went perfectly with my outfit for the evening, and not a strand was out of place for the rest of the evening.

Do not hesitate to make an appointment with Jerry or any of the other stylists at Belle Toi Salon, you will be as in love as I was at the end of my appointment!"

Recently, a dad came in with his teenage daughter and seemed unsure of what to get because of extensive price list.  I offered to tell him, he said okay, and they settled on nail and toe package that cost $36.  The dad left, and the girl sat next to me.  The tech kept asking her, do you want this?  She said yes, not realizing it cost more.  When I intervened, the boss came running over pointing and shaking finger in my face, Mind Your Own Business.  They wanted to rip this girl off and let her dad pay the price.  By the time I got up to go, they had her up to $58 from $36 that dad agreed to.  Never going back.  Bad news place.  Kay C."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Kat is the worst technician & this place is awful. 
Lets start with she was very rude. I was initiating conversation trying to communicate while she was very short and constantly yawning during my session. 

She did a very basic pedicure, never even offered me the menu to choose from. Left my feet in terrible shape. Upon removal of my gel manicure, she used the grinding tool very hard on my natural nails. Leaving ridges and dents now weeks later. 

I complained to the manager up front and she just shrug it off. Its been 2 weeks since my visit and I've waited to post this review. 

Basically, you're walking into old dingy decor with people sitting very close to each other during services because the technicians want to chit chat. Kat was engaging with the other techs but was very rude to me. Not sure why this type of treatment towards me was necessary when I was kind and easy going from the start. I guess she mistook my kindness for weakness and I should have spoken up sooner but waited until the end of the service to report this behavior to the manager. NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN TO THIS PLACE."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I began following stylist extraordinairely to the salon and decided to try her best for a new look. I had an appointment with Melissa, who was fantastic! She listened to what I wanted and executed it flawlessly. She listened to what I wanted and then brought me some ideas and made the best decisions. I have long, thick, wavy hair and Melissa did a great job cutting it! I will be back!I used to love this place but after a few bad experiences, I decided to stop in for a pedicure. I got a basic pedicure which was a little pricey ($45), but I really needed it. The lady who did my pedicure was very nice and did a great job. I'll definitely be back.I've been going to this location for years now. I have been looking for a new place to get my nails done. I've tried other places in the area but I haven't been to this one.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Hmmm, I suppose with most of the negative reviews, I was a little hesitant to try this place. I read the reviews and I am glad I did!

My appointment was with Holly. She was friendly and did a great job on my nails. I got a gel manicure with tips. She did a great job and I'm very happy with the results. She also did a great job on my nails. She was super sweet.

I will definitely be back!I've been to this nail salon a couple of times. I'm not sure why I don't give this place more than 5 stars. 

I went in today for a pedicure, and I was seated immediately. I was given a menu of services and my techs were very friendly. My tech was very thorough with her work, and was very thorough. My nails look great and I was very happy with the outcome. I will definitely be returning.My nail tech was very thorough and friendly, however"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I came in for a pedicure and dip manicure.  The pedicure was fine.  The woman did a good job and the dip manicure was great.  The color selection was limited.  The nail tech was nice.  I don't know how she mixed the color.  I was going to get a French tip manicure with a matte finish.  I was charged $55 for a French tip and they didn't charge me $5 for the French tip.  I don't know why.  I'll definitely not be coming back here.I'm from out of town and needed a cut and color. I went in here to get a color change and I was told to pick my color. When I picked my color, I was told to pick a color and to pick the color. I sat down and waited for my stylist to finish. I asked her to please put the color in my hair and she did. She didn't even try to say anything about it"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"The atmosphere here is very nice and the receptionist friendly and welcoming. This was my first visit and I just wanted an inexpensive, regular-polish manicure. The nail tech would not stop pressuring me to have my nails dipped. For many reasons, I was not interested today, but despite my telling her so and saying I might do that on a future visit she continued to pressure me and admonish that my nails would chip within 2 days and I'd be wasting my money. She proceeded to apply the various coats without any care, including looking at a nail edge and opting not to run the polish over it. She seemed bent on showing me I was wasting my time; this nail job wasn't going to hold up. (Not if she had anything to do with it.) I can appreciate the desire to upsell, but a ""no"" should be the end of the upsell attempt and the customer should be confident she's getting the technician's best work.  I was very disappointed in my experience. What started as a desire to freshen my nails and pamper myself on a day off wound up being stressful and apparently a waste of my time and money too."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,I've been going here for 3 years. He always does an excellent job on my nails. I'm a waitress so I'm always putting my hands in water and my nails never lift on the edges even if I go over two weeks for my fill ins.  I've seen reviews that the owner is rude. He is not rude but he will not tolerate rude behavior from a client. I've seen him tell people to leave if they start acting ugly towards him.  Just because he owns a business does not mean he should be treated any such way.  I admire him more for standing up for himself. It's his salon. He doesn't allow non-paying customers to hang out in the salon chairs with their friends. Also I took my mother here who is disabled and can't walk without her braces.  When she got her pedicure they had no problem with her staying in the spa chair until her toes were dried and could put her braces back on.  The nail tech also assisted her in putting her braces back on. I could go on and on.  If you treat them with respect you will get the same back!
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I absolutely love love love Zen Diva!! I must admit, however, that I've only indulged in their massages and have yet to try out the rest of the services menu. 

Honesty, Dani gives not only the best massages I've had in Santa Barbara, but also the best I've had in my life. All the masseuses from Zen Diva are also wonderful, friendly, prompt, and, most importantly, give great massages. 

My fiancé and I usually like to schedule a couple's massage or back-to-back massages.  It is such a wonderful experience to be in the comfort of your own home, with a glass of wine, listening to the music you love (although they'll bring music to use as well), not having to dress to go out in the world and then to welcome a lovely, respectful masseuse into your home who delivers a fabulous massage using deliciously scented, custom oils. Then after the massage(s), the added bonus, they (not you!) leave! And you can lounge around your own home in your robe with your glass of wine and truly ride out the Zen wave. 

I know we'll continue to support this fabulous, local Santa Barbara business. I wholeheartedly recommend and hope that you do too!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Okay so first I had a consultation with the owner. I saw her for a full set and a pedicure. The technician, I believe is the manager, was very professional and nice. She was friendly and did a great job on my nails. I will be back.I'm always a bit nervous about trying to find a place that I can trust with my hair. After trying several salons, I finally found the right one.  I have a hard time finding someone that can do my hair right now, so I tried out Paul Mitchell.  Paul Mitchell is the person that has cut my hair for the past 6 years, and he's great.  I've had a ton of compliments and I'm excited to see him in the future.  I've had a few bad experiences with other stylists, but Paul Mitchell was hands down the best in Tampa.  He was very friendly and welcoming, and I will definitely be returning.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"After searching for a hair stylist in Franklin ( and having tried four stylist this past year with not good results) I was tentative to try one more. However, the positive reviews on Yelp of Kourtney were encouraging so I decided to try one more time. To my delight, Kourtney was fabulous! She was able to give me a base color and a ""balyage"" hair highlighting technique that turned out beautiful. She was able to give me a very pure/ash blonde,no brass at all, and my base color looked and matched great. My total cost was $173 with tip included. 
The salon was in a lovely little apartment neighbor hood and everyone was extremely friendly. I felt like she was vey focused on me and my hair care needs and I did not feel rushed at all. She was very timely too and I was in and out in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Kourtney had a great and sweet personality and her hair and makeup also look fab so it made me feel more confident that she would do a Great job on my hair. I will definitely go back to Kourtney and I recommend her as a stylist and for blonde hair especially!!!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Curly girls, go to Ryan! I just went to Juju for the first time. My friend gave me a gift card to try the salon for my birthday. Being my birthday, I made an appointment a few days ahead of time and Ryan was recommended to me. I haven't had my hair cut in some time and I've done a decent amount of damage to it with coloring, removing color, coloring it again, etc. My hair was long, heavy, and falling flat. Ryan was very sweet and open with me. We discussed what I wanted (keep some length, want it healthy, and get some of the curl back) and what was realistic. Have to say I love it! I just feel so much lighter and my hair feel bouncy again. It's soft, looks and feels healthy, and my curl has returned! It is so very hard to find a stylist that can do a great job with curly hair and be a relatable person. Ryan is both and so much more. Very sweet and stylish. LOVED his shoes and he had a great personality. I think he's going to be my new stylist for as long as he is in the city."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Because I'm a bit particular, I've always struggled to find a salon that did fabulous work, charged me fairly, and didn't make me feel like I needed to be super fashionable every time I walk in the door.  I've gone to Bobby Mack for just over a year and have never loved a salon, a stylist or my hair so much.

Not only do I feel very welcomed and comfortable in the salon, the work is flawless (because there's no way Bobby is going to let someone walk out of his salon any other way).  I came in a golden blonde needing color correction to get more ashy.  I have LOVED my color every single time and get compliments constantly.  Everyone thinks my hair is naturally this color because the rooted blonde allows for such a gentle grow-out (read: this means you don't need to run back for touch-ups constantly, as I was doing at my last salon).  Further, Rala and the team make my hair's health a priority which I appreciate... When I came in, pieces were breaking left and right as a result of my last salon's shoddy work.

Thanks Bobby, James, Rala and team for being the absolute best!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have tried to like this clinic but cannot recommend it.  A good friend is very pleased with the Doc, but I have never met him, only his technicians.  I first tried them with a Groupon for Botox.  I had to pay extra for more units than the Groupon allowed.  Later I tried to use them for laser treatment on saggy thighs but was told that I would need more treatments than the Groupon allowed.  I was at the point of making an appointment during time I had off at Xmas but was told that no technicians would be available as they were taking time off.  I feel that if the clinic is open, ALL procedures should be available and staffing made available accordingly.  The clinic should be responsive to the need of customers.  I am also always disappointed and will ultimately never go back to the clinic since the specials offered in pricing are only ""teasers"" - never enough of the service is discounted for complete treatment the procedure on ""special"".  And like other customers, I am disappointed that there is no attempt to keep new customers with great discounts like the $99 Botox special."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love going to Pia Spa for so many reasons. Let me count the ways... 1. Staff, including PIA, are professional, courteous and always available. The front staff helps you pick a service when you're not sure about what to pick. Jasmine knows just about everything! The other girls are very personable too. They offer me something to drink and I LOVE their Zen, green or mint tea. I've never been to a salon where the owner stops and has a conversation with you. Pia treats everyone with respect and I love how she blends in with her staff. 2. Tania is so comfortable to be around while having my nails or waxing done and interesting/fun to talk to! 3. Service is SO fast! Tania is usually right there waiting as soon as I walk in. If not, she comes down pretty quick :). 4. Products; whatever type of wax they're using is great because it works for my sensitive skin! (I don't know the name of it). Their candles are perfect for anyone special in your life. I bought a couple for some friends and they love the smell. IF I keep going, this will turn into an essay. Love you all at PIA!!!"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I am over the top soooo thrilled with this salon. Came here from Chicago in February to attend a wedding. Chelsea gave me a beautiful  beachy updo. It was EXACTLY what I envisioned it should look like. And I am one of those crazy gals that is VERY particular about my hair. Chelsea also styled my 
unruly bangs to perfection. I have been going to a salon in Chicago that I consider upscale, & Chelsea 
styled my hair better than I have ever experienced. I came back to St Pete for a vacay on May 16
Chelsea was off that day, so I scheduled with Kati
She was also soooo fabulous in listening to how I like my hair blown out. She took great pains & time to achieve the best job I've ever had. Kati also explained all the products she was using & their attributes. Not only did Chelsea & Kati do a fabulous job on my hair, they were sweet, welcoming & approachable. I can't say enough wonderful things about this salon. Only con is that I live in Chicago!!! I will DEFINITELY visit Mimi's next time I am in town. Thank you gals for doing such a fabulous job.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Was searching all over yelp for a good place to get my eyebrows waxed in manayunk/roxborough since it's a bit of a drive to go all the way to Havertown (where i used to live) to get them done at Jenny's nails there.  I decided to take a chance on this place, and I am glad I did!  It's a bit pricier than I am used to ($10 for an eyebrow wax, I am used to $7) but she did a great job.  There was a separate waxing room with a table to lay down on.  It was one of the least painful eyebrow waxes I have received, and the lady even complimented me on the shape of my eyebrows, which was nice - although not due to anything I had done, it was the last waxers doing! :) 

There were 8-10 women getting pedicures when I walked on (Saturday afternoon) and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I will have to check them out for a pedicure next time!  Definitely recommend - it is clean, relaxing and very attentive employee!   Also, you are able to just walk right in - so that was beneficial as well!"

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,Very nice place like everyone has mentioned in previous reviews. I decided to do the VIP it is a bit pricey for pedicure but they didn't cut any expenses. It was a full relaxation of foot relaxation separate from the salon. It was peaceful. Along with a decent red wine. Not out the of the box wine if you know what I mean. My nails were done by wen and she put special touches and made sure they were perfect. We tried a new product that is known to be natural and stronger than dip. Being a huge dip fan I was sceptic  but in the end I really liked the out come. My nails feel so natural and in a couple of weeks I will see how well they hold up. Every month they have a special and they honor their work. So if anything should go wrong with your nails you can come back and they will fix I was told. I can't wait to go back. One more thing... I noticed they definitely take their appointments seriously so I would make an appointment and it's really very easy on their website. Plus they send you reminder texts and confirmations. Never has that before.

Now, I'm currently training to become a firefighter, which has definitely taken a toll on my body. I've always picked male massage therapists because I thought they would be able to give a deeper massage but damn did Lexi change my whole opinion on that. I've been getting massages since I was young and no one has ever even compared to Lexi. This is what she's made to do. She knows exactly what your body needs and she makes you feel extremely comfortable while doing it. I've fallen asleep in every massage I've gotten from her, which is unheard of for me. I could lay on her heated massage table for hours and still not want to get up! I couldn't recommend her more. She frequently does specials/giveaways on her social media so make sure you follow her because even though her pricing is amazing for what you get, who wouldn't want a free massage?

The front desk staff is almost like a mockery of themselves (but no where near as bad as at le jardin)... They are, indeed, rude, but they always go out of their way to make appts for you when you call.  They're only rude in person... and remember... they're like that to everyone, not just you :)

The owner is an outstanding stylist.  I've seen a few others.  Eh.  Some of them are local hairdressers at extra high prices.  Others are really well trained stylists.  Keep trying them out until you find the right fit -- the salon will always make sure you get them when you call.

Now.. the spa services are extraordinary.  Truly.  The price is right (especially if you get a package), the back rooms are quiet and so so so so tranquil and lovely.. every masseuse and specialist is obviously well trained.  I've been to the spa scores of times....I highly, highly recommend them.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,DO NOT GO HERE. I went for the first time with my friend for pedicures. They turned our soaking water all the way to hot where we couldn't put our feet in. After politely telling them they told us our feet were sensitive. They then gave the lady next to us ice cold water to the point she couldn't put her feet in. Giving that we were all black and none of the white patrons had any issue with water and didn't have to wait for a tech like the three of us did... I got uneasy. As they began to work on our feet my friend's tech leaned in towards mine and began talking about how big my feet were in Chinese assuming I didn't understand. FALSE. I was completely embarrassed. I texted my friend what had happened and she was shocked. When my toes were done being painted they rolled their eyes I wanted them under the fan even though a white woman had been sitting at the fans for her toes for the full 5 minutes. They let me sit for one. Upon checking out they demanded a tip from my friend and rolled their eyes at her. I will never go back. Completely unprofessional.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I signed up with ME of Citrus Park 6 years ago and only went to this location approx. 3-4 times before I moved to Lutz where I found the Van Dyke location a closer and better fit for me. The main reason why I was wanting to cancel my contract @ CP was due to the EXCESSIVE phone calls that they kept calling me regarding the services that Citrus Park was now offering. I asked them on MANY occasions to STOP and nothing was done (No apology from the manager when I was canceling). I was paying my monthly dues to CP and asked if I could be transferred but they said no due to the fact that the Van Dyke location is not located outside the ""district"".  So I now have to cancel completely and resign at VD so I can continue to get my massages with one of the best massage therapist around.  It is so sad that CP was not willing to stop their crazy phone calls when asked so I wouldn't have to go to all this work and cancel my membership.  But honestly...I'm glad I did after what I've been hearing through others about CP - ME no love lost!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I would prefer to not give any stars, but here is my one star review. I had an appointment today at 1:45 for gel set with Jeni, a gal I have been going to for awhile. I waited over 20 minutes and decided to walk out. This isn't the first time have had a negative experience here. Last week my daughter was there and they made her move from where she was waiting at the front because it was for people getting pedicures. Then she was told she has one of the ""mean faces"" by Lindsey. My daughter was just confused when asked to leave the seat she was in because we ALWAYS wait in those chairs. AND I was told to sit in that exact seat today while I waited over 20 minutes for my appointment.  During another visit at this location, I had my phone sitting next to me while I was getting my nails done. The small man that works there came up next to me out of the blue  and kept tapping the camera on my phone with his nail telling me that something was wrong with my camera.  WTH!  I will never go back and suggest you don't either."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Bottom line: I love Aveda salons, and this was the BEST Aveda salon I have ever been to. My haircut lays fantastically in all different kinds of styles! I will be back!!

Tai was not only sweet and welcoming, but as she cut my hair she thought of everything! She asked me many questions about how I like to wear my hair, style it, if I put it behind my ears, etc., and gave me a cut that works in every situation! I have very thick and wavy hair, and she worked magic on it :) Additionally, I always give hairdressers a vague idea of what I want, and end with ""but since you're the expert, you do what you think looks good."" They are usually hesitant to follow-through with that last point, but Tai ran with it. She is truly an artist and gave me the best haircut of my life! She didn't go crazy, but she gave me a cut that I wouldn't have even known how to ask for! 

I used a Groupon, and as a chronic Groupon-er (I only get my haircut when I get a groupon, so I'm not loyal) I am absolutely coming back here and making this my regular spot! Thank you!"

I had to go home and re-shape them myself. I'm now 6 weeks away from the very beginning of my hair. I will NEVER go back to this place.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,Two weeks ago I called and asked if they could do a full set for my daughter and they said yes. I had to get a full set and the girl who did it was rude and did not take her time. She rushed through the whole process. I will never go back. I had a full set with gel and it started to peel off after one week. I had to go home and re-do it myself. I went back and they fixed it for free and I went back to get them fixed. The nail tech was rude and did not listen to what I wanted. She did not speak to me or give me the option to come back.

We recently moved to the area and I have been looking for a new place to go for facials and facials. I'm so glad I found this gem!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My 'Heaven' Package received as a birthday present from family was - well ... Heavenly!  Putting the obvious out there, it's hard to say anything negative about a gift of facial, massage, body treatment and Spa Mani/Pedi (including paraffin)!  That said, Botanica Day Spa exceeded expectations on all counts. 

More disclosure, I've never experienced a spa package before but have experienced each service individually ... And it's easy to vet the good from the not so good (and have had both!)

Warmly welcomed upon arrival, my time there was seamlessly orchestrated - easily moving from service to service. Each technician explained products/ techniques, etc. and I enjoyed how the options were presented in a non- pressurized way. I'll try a few as I replenish my current stock

Every technician was top tier in terms of personality and skill in their speciality and took responsibility to make my experience memorable. 

Each was ready at appointed time and the room and products were assembled and ready to begin on time.  All products used were high caliber and comparable to those used in other high end spas. 

Based on my experience, I'd recommend the spa and plan to bring my daughter to an upcoming open house and schedule a girls outing."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I am a member of the Port Orange location of Massage Envy.  Since I have family in Tarpon, I have made a couple of appointments at your Clearwater location. The last one was about two weeks ago.  I left feeling disappointed. I let the therapist know that I prefer firm to deep pressure, but I feel like he thought he would break me.  I truly don't complain much which is why I didn't say anything. He was kind and perhaps doing his best.  One thing I did notice after returning to my local Port Orange M.E.  You definitely need an update on your linens. The ones here are soft, there is a wool mattress cover under the sheets as well that adds to the comfort of the massage.  The sheets at your location felt like paper and it was one of the first things I noticed.  I realize that many people don't visit different Massage Envy's and I believe they are independently owned or franchised. I can tell you that I would give the Port Orange location 5 stars in comparison.  Just some suggestions from someone who has been a member for many years and been to a few different locations."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place is too overpriced and has a ton of flaws. First of all, if you hate Sports, you'll love it. I know you don't go to the gym to watch TV but it's still right in front of your face so it's nice to have some sports-related stuff on right? Well, if you work out here get used to watching HGTV, keeping up with the kardashians, food network, and HSN while you work out. Makes sense right?

Second, there's a considerable lack of machines. Common machines like standing calf raise, decline chest press and tricep extension don't exist here. Other common machines you'll have to routinely wait on since they only have one of them. A lot of machines are also rusted to the point you can't adjust them.

My last thing is there's NEVER any employees on the floor. If you have a question or anything you'll have to walk all the way to the front reception desk. Very odd for a place this expensive to never ever have employees/trainers on the floor.

The good things? Julio and many of the staff are PHENOMENAL. Give Julio a raise. They keep this place afloat. Locker room is also very nice.

It should be about $75 a month MAX for what you get."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I've been going to this location for the last 10 years.  I always receive excellent service and the owner is always very accommodating.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I didn't realize the resort was so large. Our room looked like the photo and when we arrived we asked for first floor so we had a patio because they were going to put us on the first. We had a pool right behind us via a short walk but not ""THE"" pool. That as actually good because the Lochness (the main pool) is entirely for kids not adults. The cocktail bar is there for that reason. I went to go swimming and felt like an idiot because there were no adults in the pool on a very busy weekend. We ended up leaving and going back to our own pool. The rooms themselves were good and comfy, although ours smelled like it might have once been a smoking room. The biggest pet peeve was the thermostat won't go below 70 and it was VERY HOT the weekend we were there so we sweat through the night. You can set the thermostat to 65 but it won't go below 70. The resort isn't really near anything like the water or anything fun, so other than all the above that's the main reason I wouldn't stay again, because it's not the type of resort where you could just stay there all day (boring."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,Wish I could give this no stars. My normal nail tech moved but I decided I would go and try a different one from same place. The girl that did my nails was new at doing them. She did her best to get them ok. She had the owner come over and fix some. The owner bashed what she did. Said I needed to come to her to get them fixed cause the nail tech was new and didn't use enough powder etc. I paid and came back 19 mins later cause I had to pick something up. When came back was 20 mins to close. The owner was screaming at me that she didn't have time to fix them cause she had plans. I said you still are open for 20 mins you need to fix them ir give me my money back. She yelled at me for the whole 20 mins in front of my child. She tried to fix them they still looked like crap but I was done with her and her bashing me in front of my child. Do not go to this place. They treat you like crap and your nails look horriable I now have to pay someone else to get them fixed!

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I used to go to this salon often when I lived on Davis Island a few years ago.  I recently moved back to the area and, not sure what happened, but it is not nearly as good. 

My husband got his haircut... 2 days later he went back because it was so horrid...they attempted to fix it but its a man's haircut, only so much you can do.

For my experiences, I tried sending 'George' the owner SEVERAL emails over several days because i received a confirmation to a hair appointment that had been rescheduled days earlier. Then I try calling the salon and am hung up on the first time and the second time on hold for 10 minutes ...all to RECONFIRM an appointment i had ALREADY changed. When I expressed I was annoyed that I am spending a ridiculous amount of time for their lack of management, she said ""well the owner, George, is really busy so he doesn't always have time to respond""....um then why don't you get an assistance George? If your ""too busy"" to respond to the individuals that support YOUR busy and to address errors in YOUR system...no words.

I'm sorry - but for such a ""nice""  (expensive) salon - their customer service is horrible."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"""This joint is an oasis in the urban desert"" -Yelp. No but really, I've been here twice; once with a Groupon and once for the couples massage/soak package. My initial experience was wonderful, having purchased a Groupon for a one hour couples soak. When I called to make the reservation, the woman on the phone was pleasant in explaining the process to me, the amenities, facts about their water source, and extras I could add (bath salt, essential oil). Upon arrival the staff was friendly and told us how to use the tub, as well as briefed us on the water temperature so we could find our comfort level. The atmosphere was very relaxed. 
This first experience inspired my boyfriend and I to return for the sweetheart package. Our one hour soak was very relaxing, then we were taken to the massage room. Heather and Gordon were our masseuses, and had given us an intake for prior to the massage. It was such a divine experience, we plan on making it a semi-regular activity. With the massage package we each got a sachet of bath salts to take home! Definitely recommend this facility, as their outdoor amenities are also lovely and they provide chilled hot spring water for you to enjoy."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place has a ton of options for restaurants, a good gambling area, 3 outdoor pools open year round, hot tubs, spa, arcade, and a bunch of shopping options. The rooms have been renovated in the last few years and are a stunning Tuscany style. The higher up you are the better the mountain views are. There is a map of the whole resort I highly recommend getting so you can see it all. There are four towers alone that are all full of various room types. 
The arcade on the second floor is huge! My boyfriend and I played $20 and we were there for about an hour playing games. They were all very affordable. One of our favorites was the one right when you enter the arcade. You lay on your back and it is a virtual tour machine of different things like old mines. Super cool and real feeling. A bunch of the games are like virtual reality with moving seats.
The restaurants are amazing!! There are about 10 options. Seafood, steaks, bistro, Italian, Chinese, and a couple small cafes.
They have live music and shows so check in advance for what is coming up on their website. 
I really enjoyed my time here and would love to stay again."

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Since my original posting below (which you should certainly read now, before continuing on), I have received several more pieces from Lee Cramer - all of which are incredible in their attention to detail and overall design. I should note that I have seen many of the other artists at the various other Headlight locations in action, and it seems like you really can't go wrong with any individual artist on their roster. Check out their online portfolios and see for yourself.

That said, I'm providing this update for those wanting to follow through on my recommendation of Lee Cramer specifically. Lee is now working exclusively at Headlight's shop in Woodstown. It's a bit off of the beaten path, but this has two benefits: 1.) You don't have to go to Deptford, home of not one, but two Wal-Marts...puke; and 2.) You get a nice scenic drive on the way to the shop, which is situated on the quaint and quiet main street in Woodstown. It's also good if you like cows, 'cause, my fine friends, there are many a cow to be seen on the way there. But please, resist the urge to leave the car. These particular cows ""don't play well with others.""

Enjoy your tattoo...and TIP, for the love of god!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Fabulous place!!! I have been suffering with some neck and shoulder pain for the last two months. After one visit my pain is noticeably less and I can move freely. I can't even imagine what it will be like after my second visit. The space is lovely with calming music and ambient lighting, giving you a sense of peace and serenity. The ladies at the front desk were very pleasant and seemed interested in me as a person not just another body passing through the spa. I had the sense that they really liked their job. My massage therapist was Hannah she was WONDERFUL. She took time before the massage to talk with me about what my needs were and adjusted her course of action to better accommodate my specific injury. The bed had a warmer, which was a very nice touch, and the lotion was warm. I was covered in a fleece blanket the entire time and never felt cold or uncomfortable. They give you time to gather yourself and dress and I liked that I didn't feel rushed out. Upon leaving you are given the therapist's recommendations and told about their loyalty programs. I enjoyed my experience so much I signed up for a membership and will be back monthly."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"A friend and I were brunching on Magazine, and wanted to get our nails did. I'm a creature of habit but since we were in this area, we pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and saw the stellar rating for Lilly's Nails & Spa!

I was so impressed with this first visit! They were kind of packed when we got there, so we opted for just gel manis. I would suggest making an appointment if you want all 20 digits worked on! 

They have a nice selection of colors to choose from. As soon as I picked a color, they began the full metal-soak on my hodge podge of still gelled nails while I waited. We didn't wait long before two techs came to do us right. She was quick, gentle, and pleasant to me (not treating me like just a pair of ten fingers dangling in front of her). She did a wonderful job, and got my buddy and I much needed water bottles. The cost was a little more than my normal spot but well worth the attention to detail. I will say I have some early chipping in the first week so I can't necessarily go full 5 stars, but I definitely want to return if I'm in this area!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,I have mixed feels about this place and the staff. I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and the lady at the front desk was not happy with my nails. She was rude and rushed. She rushed through the whole process. I had to ask her to file and shape my nails because I wanted them to be longer. I had to ask her to file.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This location has serviced me 3x due to my legience of the GA locations which were excellant service, customer relations and training..2 of 3 visits here were poor outcomes due to lack of skill set and attention to customer; however I continued to give them a third try. Today I was to be seen by the former stylist Adrianne for low lights and trim to bring definition to my natural brunette color that was colored over last visit due to its light color which I no longer wanted.  I sat in chair and conveyed to Adrianne to please not take offense but needed her to know my last visit she butchered my hair in back and didnt cut/stack satisfactory and was in too much of a hurry and could she please not rush and stack my hair in back as I requested. Instead of calling or going back due to my dismay I still tipped her and just held off till next visit to fill her in..She took my request as an insult instead of critique and said ""I'm offended, take your hair somewhere else"".

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I stumbled upon Art Addiction via a Facebook group then went to check out their Instagram page and liked what I saw. Even though the tattoo I wanted was SUPER simple, I still wanted to go to a place that did quality work and seemed professional and cleanly. Art Addiction was just that. I signed up for a consultation on their website. We did it over the phone. I paid my deposit and my appointment was set for the day I requested. My tattoo artist was Alex and he made sure to take his time with the entire process and explain everything very well. He made sure I was comfortable and was satisfied with placement before he began. My tattoo was very sentimental (my deceased father's handwriting) so I was glad that he took such care and ensured that I was happy with it. It came out great. My swelling went down very quickly and since then I've had no itching or peeling. Alex explained aftercare quite well so I've been following those instructions.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"My friend and I went here to get our holiday nails done before Christmas- and never will again. The receptionist was the best part of our experience, she was so extremely nice. We had an appointment scheduled, and the nail techs doing our nails immediately rushed us to pick our colors when we had been looking for less than a minute. While we were picking our nail colors, the nail techs also came over and laughed at our nails, which is strange because we were there to get our nails done. While getting our nails done, it was very painful and rushed. I had parts of my cuticles shaved off with the tools they were using. My nails did come out looking very nice at the end, until a day later when the polish started to chip. So, I went back in two days later asking them to kindly fix my nails, and there was no apologies made or anything, they just made me feel like I was an inconvenience. After fixing them that day, they started chipping AGAIN a day later. I was willing to try Beautiful Nails with all the great reviews, and maybe if you're a regular you get treated better, but if you're a new customer I would avoid going here."

The warmth and kindness you get when you walk through the doors is the same feeling I had when I was 16. Kay's is definitely a house hold name for the Westbank community of New Orleans. Especially for the Asians. She remembers everyone by name. Their story, their struggle is hers to share. She's not only a stylist, but a damn good counselor. Even watching her kids grow up is amazing. So much history in this little house that's a beauty salon. And her daughter, Lissy, is the next gen to carry the torch. She specializes in make up also! So women, get it right!! 
Although I moved away years ago, I come to visit every time I'm in town. She is the best eye brow threader I know. And she gives the best fades for hair cuts. I know because when I go to other places, she makes them pale in comparison. My father also comes here in which he still lives in New Orleans. And I know I'll continue to come here every time I'm in town. Most definitely recommend to young and old. This is somewhere you can definitely grow old with."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Laura is AMAZING! I moved here a year ago and have been a loyal customer for almost three years. I always have the best experience with both Heather and the rest of the staff. I have had many massages and have been very pleased with their professionalism. I always feel welcome and comfortable with Heather. She is very knowledgeable and takes her time. I have had several massages and all have been very professional. I have had a few different therapists and they all have been very good. I highly recommend Heather. She is the only one I trust to do my massage. I feel so relaxed and comfortable here and am looking forward to my next one.I went in for a gel manicure and I was very pleased with the results. I went in for a gel manicure and it was $45. I went in with a very long, natural looking gel manicure and the lady took off a few nails that were really short and didn't even cover them with nail polish.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I moved from Tokyo where I have been to many nail salons and this is the first one I will go back to! I am so glad I found this place. The staff is so friendly and professional. I will be back for sure!I have been to this nail salon several times and have always had a great experience. I have had a gel manicure and pedicure. I always get a pedicure and it is always clean. The prices are very reasonable. They do a great job on both the manicure and pedicure. 

However, my last visit was a nightmare. I called at 3:30 and they said that they were closing at 3:45 and they would be able to take me in at 4:30. I had an appointment for 3:45 and the technician was not even with me until almost 3:50. I had a manicure and pedicure and my nails were done in about 15 minutes.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Was on the hunt for a new nail salon and decided to try it out. I was not disappointed. The salon is cute and bright. The staff is very friendly. The owner was very helpful and made me feel comfortable. I will be back.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes before my appointment time and was seated for my manicure. I was seated for my pedicure. When I went to pay the lady who was at the front desk was not helpful. She did not ask me how much I was there for my manicure. She said $10 for a manicure and $10 for a gel manicure. I was shocked at how long my service would take. I had a manicure with the gel manicure and I asked to have the nail file removed and they said they would remove it and they would soak it off. I was shocked at this point
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Arguable one of the best barber shops not just in Santa Barbara but in all of California. The vibe inside is classic barber shop which you can feel since it's a family owned & operated business. A historic business on the Mesa catering to locals, college students & visitors alike. Truly part of the community with customers in age from younger kids crying in the chair while being cheered up by the barbers to the elderly just wanting a fresh neat haircut and everything in between. Full barber shop talk happening while each barber is doing excellent work. Sports on the TVs & skilled haircuts being done. What more could you ask for? Make sure you have an appointment as the waiting times for walk ins can be long since they are in such high demand. Just call in to make an appointment. Want an old school straight razor shave? They've got you. Want some unique design or proper fades done this is your place. Offering hand sanitizer & wiping down chairs between customers as well as masks on for customers & employees. Taking more precautions than some restaurants. You can tell they care about the customers. Mesa Barbers is part of Santa Barbara history & should be your go to location for hair cuts etc."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I thought about giving this review just 4 stars because the prices are so ridiculous, but it truly is worth the splurge if you can afford it! I had a 50-min facial and my mother-in-law had a 50-min massage and we both LOVED every second of it. The customer service is impeccable and they really make you feel like you belong there. The facilities are clean and luxurious, with a dry and wet sauna, robes and slippers, showers, lockers, and a relaxation lounge on the second floor with the most comfortable chairs that face the windows overlooking the ocean. The lounge also has teas, lemonade, and snacks, and there's a fireplace and couches and I would definitely reccomend getting there early to have some extra time to enjoy it all. My esthetician was very nice and offered some helpful tips for my sensitive skin. She used Tata Harper products which left me glowing all day and were nonirritating. I also liked that she wrote down which products she used along with her suggestions but there was no pressure to buy any products. If I had to complain it would be that the 50-min facial was not a second more than 50 minutes and for $170 you would expect a little more. Worth trying once for sure!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,I'm sorry to be posting this but I unfortunately will not be returning to this nail salon. I've been going here for about a year and a half and have had two separate issues which have led me to make my decision. Customer service and quality is fantastic here though which is why I'm putting 3/5 stars. The main issue I have is the I have is the overall cleanliness of the pedicures here. They use the same pedicure tools on all of their clients and I don't remember seeing if they clean them before or after using. First my fiancé and I were both getting pedicures and the combination of callus remover and scrubbing actually gave him an abrasion on his toe. His big toenail also began to darken with toenail fungus relatively soon after I took him here but I'm not sure if that is just a coincidence or not. I was just there on Friday 5/24/19 and I noticed the next day my feet seemed to feel somewhat dry but today less than a week later my feet feel like sandpaper and I have very dry scaly feet with a slight burning sensation which leads me to believe I may have something bacterial/ fungal going on. I wish the best for this business.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"Worst ever.  This is a place you want to try for a massage, not a relaxing one.  If you want a massage, this is the place.  Do not go here.  They are overpriced and overpriced.I had an appointment with Sara for a balayage and a cut. I was the only client in the salon and didn't have an appointment. Sara did my hair and did a fantastic job! She listened to what I wanted and made suggestions for what would look best on my hair. I have curly hair and she did an amazing job! I'm so glad I found her. I have been going to Sara for almost 10 years now. I'll be going back and highly recommend her to anyone!This is my first time here and I had a great experience.  I had the best experience at the spa and I will definitely be back.  The spa was very clean and relaxing.  I had a facial and a pedicure.  My technician was very knowledgeable and took her time on my skin care and made sure it"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I had my first spa day with the owner and it was a great experience. I was greeted by a very friendly woman and I was offered a drink as soon as I entered the spa. I was given a choice of tea, water, tea, water and tea. I had the 90 minute massage. I was offered a beverage and I had a glass of wine. The massage was very good. I had to ask for a specific therapist. The massage therapist was good, but she seemed to have a lack of experience with reflexology. I felt like she was going to just do a massage. The room was clean, quiet and cozy. The massage itself was very relaxing. I'll be going back. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. It's $25 and I was charged $45. I guess I was paying $65 for a service I didn't receive. I'm not a big fan of polish, I've had good experiences. I just wanted a basic manicure and pedicure. I was charged $45 for the services."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Just revisited the hotel on 09/05/09 and must say I'm quite impressed.

All the rooms are remodeled and has almost a Venetian feel to them.  Sony LCD TVs.. even Encore uses Sharp.  Internet included.  I slept comfortably in the soft bed and didn't wake up to any outside noise this time.

Check out their arcade game area.  The games are up to date and maintained well.  I was planning to gamble but ended up playing here for about a hour or two.

The hotel is about 5 mins off the main area with Harrahs/Silver Legacy, etc. so the tables here aren't packed at all.  We were able to play at a empty $5 craps table on a Saturday.

Because of the remodeling, the hotel's theme is very conflicting.  Almost funny.  The hotel portion has a nice Venetian/Tuscany look and the rest of it has this neon/flash dance type of look.

Tip
- Book the cheapest room, arrive late and most likely they'll give you an upgrade because the cheaper rooms are all taken.


Conclusion
- For the price, I'd book here again.  I paid $30 for a Friday night
- If I were going for convenience, book at Silver Legacy
- If I were going for pure quality of the room, Grand Sierra Resort - The Summit rooms"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"My husband and I love going to all the local spas here in Reno. Each spa offers different amenities and we choose where we are going based on what type of experience we would like to have.
Our experience at The Spa was average. The attendant didn't offer a tour as she took my back to show me to my locker. I usually like to be shown around on my first visit. The attendees were all very nice and constantly asked if I needed anything. The spa is immaculate, I didn't get freaked out about bacteria if my foot brushed the floor. We were at the spa to have pedicures prior to our beach vacation. The nail tech (Marilou I believe) was very nice. My husband had Lyssa and he was happy with the massage portion. The supervisor with all the tattoos walking around seemed stressed and unhappy with the girls working there because one had gotten nail polish on a chair (it was easily removed with some nail polish remover). 
We used the steam room and sauna. The outside spa was on.. but it didn't seemed filled all the way and the water was slightly green.
Overall our experience was pleasant but The Spa at Silver Legacy leaves something to be desired. They also offer no locals discount."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Heather Garden honestly is a gem. The space is comfortable and relaxing. Heather is the best massage therapist I've had. The front desk is also very helpful and helpful. The massages are amazing. I highly recommend Heather. I will be back for sure. I've been coming here for about a year now and I've never had a bad experience. They are very clean and the staff is very professional. They have a lot of colors to choose from and always offer great suggestions. They do a great job on my nails and have a wide range of nail colors. They are always very friendly and always have a great time. They also have a lot of great specials!I had a full set done here and was in and out in an hour and 15 minutes. I've had a few nails break and some have been pretty bad. I was going to a new place and had to go back to get them fixed. I went back to get them fixed, and the lady who did them said that she was good. She didn't offer to fix them."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This salon is such a gem. The owner, Nancy, is so kind and makes sure you are comfortable. She is a true professional. I have had great experiences with other stylists and they all have been so professional and kind. This salon is so cute and everyone is so nice. I have also seen Tracy and she is great too! I highly recommend this salon. I just went there with my sister for my wedding. I love this place! I love the decor and the staff is always so friendly. The nail techs are super nice and are always so personable. The pedicure is great and they have a lot of great colors to choose from. I have never had a bad experience here. I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I asked for a little longer but she made it as short as possible. I got a pretty low fade but not too much. I got my hair cut with a different girl. She was very nice and gave me a good cut. I was very pleased with the results."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My best friend and I came here months ago before a vacation and had great service and nails that lasted. It was a great time so we decided to come back before the holidays. Terrible service and experience. My technician seemed upset about all the work that was having to be put into it. She didn't listen to me about the length I
wanted and said the length I wanted wouldnt work with the shape of my fingers. Instead she gave me super long
nails. She didn't even offer for me to wash my hands after
filing everything down and left so many uneven edges
on my nails, not to mention nails on both hands being
different lengths. In the following days multiple nails have chipped as well. My friend wanted a gel pedicure but the person doing it gave her regular Polish and didn't do all her toes, she cut her nails without asking the length. She was just rude about it all. Im not sure if we will be coming back after this visit considering how we felt like an
inconvenience to them. Also it's strange that they watch over you when you tip.. but that's besides the point. I spent over $70, it's been less than a week and I already have to get them removed or somehow fixed. Very disappointing."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I chose this salon because it's the closest one to my apartment. I was a little cautious based on the previous reviews. I called ahead to see if they had availability for the same afternoon (Friday). They said they had an open afternoon, so to come on over. When I got there, I believe there were only one or two other clients. Actually, a few of the techs got into a minor disagreement over whose turn it was to see a client. That was a little uncomfortable to watch, but I totally get it that these ladies are probably paid on a commission basis, and each client matters on a slow day.

My tech, Helen (pretty sure), did an awesome job with my mani/pedi. Admittedly, my last one was about 4 months ago, so she had a little extra work to do. The salon has a good selection of colors--OPI, Essie, and Vinyl Lux (no extra charge!). Pretty basic interior. I think there were 6 pedi chairs and 5 mani stations. The pedi chair was comfortable enough and had great massage settings. 
My mani/pedi was $45, so not too bad!
Not a 5 star place because it's missing the wow/upscale factor. But it's definitely worth a try, especially when you don't want to pay luxury prices for a great service."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Sisters' opens at 9:30 on a Friday and they close at 9:30 on a Saturday. 

I am very happy with the service and the results. 

The other reviewer mentioned that it is not in a large shopping center. 

I was happy to have found this place. 

I did get a 60 minute deep tissue massage and was really impressed. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I will definitely be returning for another massage!I had a great experience at this location. I got a Brazilian wax with Roxanne. She was super nice and knowledgeable. She really took her time and made sure my skin was smooth and clean. I will definitely be back!I went to see Mary for the first time and I had a great experience!  She was very nice, made me feel very comfortable and my nails look fabulous.  I would recommend her to anyone! She's amazing.I've been going to this location for years and I love it! Everyone is so nice and always makes you feel welcome."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Giving a negative review goes here because the quality of work is great. However, I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the worst. I was in and out in 45 minutes and the result was a horrible job. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was looking for a place to get my nails done. I came here for the first time. I was very nervous about getting my nails done and they did a great job. I got a gel manicure and it was $30. The lady that did my nails was so nice and did a great job. I will definitely be back. I have been going to this salon for about a year now and I have never had a bad experience. It is always clean, professional and affordable. My gel manicures last a long time and are always on point. My only complaint is that the techs are very hard to communicate with but I have never had a problem with them. I always have a great experience with this salon. I've been coming here for about 4 years. The service."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,On the 2/27/16 I called and asked if they had an opening.  They said yes and said they had an opening.  I explained to the manager that I wanted to call and get an appointment.  She said that they had a cancellation policy for the day of my appt.  I was confused as to why the phone call was made to the customer.  She said that she didn't have an appt.  I explained that I was told that I had an appt for 6pm today.  I explained that I had an appt at 6pm.  She said she had an appt for 6pm today.  I explained that I was there for 6pm and that she was doing a bad job.  She said that she would not give me an appt today.  I explained that she was doing a bad job.  She said she would call me back.  I was confused by this and asked if she was going to call me back.  She said no and I went to her.  I was confused by her
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I really didn't want to make this review, but I am honestly just really upset and disappointed because I really wanted to like this place. Let me start off by saying the staff and owner are very friendly and kind, and it is a gorgeous salon which is why it pains me to leave this review. I paid $42 for a gel manicure only for it to fall off within 2-3 days of me having it. It took her 1 hr to do a simple gel mani with no design, I've never had such a long gel manicure in my life, even the times I've gotten designs. The color was thick in some parts and thin in others. It got to the point where I got so frustrated of looking at how ugly my nails were,  I peeled the gel off and did my own nails at home. I really wanted to give this salon a try as I am local and love supporting local business but this is just not it. At my regular salon (classy nails by lee) my gel will even last me up to a month. I am in no way rough with my nails for them to be chipped and peeling in 2 days. This was a complete waste of money and time."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This is the most unprofessional salon I have ever been to!! The owner who sits in the 1st chair on the right, is the Worst Stylist  of them all!! She did my hair last Sunday and it was a hot mess. I had wet and wavy hair. She braided my fine hair without any braiding hair. She did my whole sew-in in 25 mins! I should have known it would have been sloppy. She only damped a small portion of my wet and wavy hair instead of putting me under the sink. My hair was so wild because it was half dry still and a little wet from the spray bottle she was using. The whole time she was doing my hair, she and another stylist were bad talking about the other stylists in there. So Unprofessional!!! I just left upset and I figured I would style it myself when I got home.  By the time I got home, tracks were already coming out!  Then I felt something sharp poking me in my head so I felt around and she left the damn needle in my hair!!!  I will Never allow her to do my hair again and I feel it's my duty to let everyone know! I wish I could give them No stars!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was very excited to try this place after reading the reviews. I walked in and was immediately greeted by Julia, who was an absolute sweetheart and continually checked in with me. The place is pretty and smells great. I was paired with Kim to do my fill. She was not personable and barely said two words. She shaped my nails the wrong shape after I told her the opposite, so she had to redo them and then the were extremely short. She also did a horrible paint job, it looks like I have a huge gap at my cuticle from where the paint starts. So basically I'll have to get my nails redone in the next week because they will be grown out. I had already decided I would come back and try out a different technician the next time until I got up to pay. I was completely shocked at how outrageous their pricing is. Definitely ask before you sit down. I spend a lot of money on things and I am used to getting a gel/acrylic fill for under $40. They charged me $50, without tip. Absolutely insane. I don't know what they are up charging, if it's the free beverages or what, but this is steep even for me. Sadly I will not be returning."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Okay. To be honest, i had an appointment with the stylist who did my hair the day before. (I am very particular about my hair and she was very accommodating to my request.)

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I just had the worst experience here.  I went in for a simple gel manicure and the woman doing it had no idea what she was doing.  She had a very rude attitude and seemed like she was in a rush.  I told her I wanted my nails short and she said ""it's a long nail and it's a long nail"".  I asked if she could make my nails short and she said ""it's long"".  I told her I wanted coffin and she said ""no problem"" and proceeded to tell me I'm not getting coffin.  She then told me it's a long nail.  I wanted a coffin shape.  She did not care to shape them properly and was clearly trying to make them too short.  She made them too short.  I asked her to file them shorter and she was going to cut them too short.  She was very rude to me and did not even apologize.  I was so upset that I had to pay and leave.  I will never go back.  My nails looked terrible and I will never recommend"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I went to Salon Fiber for the first time this week.  I was looking for a good hair salon in the burbs and I saw this had a couple good Yelp reviews.

The place was busier than expected for a Thursday night, but Wendy had been sick earlier in the week, so maybe they were trying to fit in the people that needed to be rescheduled.  It seemed like everyone was juggling multiple clients. 

Wendy gave me a great haircut though.  She gave me exactly what I was looking for.  Everyone was friendly.  The place is a little more laid back, which is my style.  I had already decided I was going to return for future haircuts, and then I got a card in the mail welcoming me to Salon Fiber and giving me $10 off my next cut.  That's a nice touch.  I also want to add for my curly haired peeps- that I have very curly hair.  And they knew how to cut it right.

It was a little hard to find and my GPS told me to turn onto a sidewalk.  But I was only lost for a few minutes before I found it.  Overall, it seems like a nice place with nice people.  I will return."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"What a nice little nail salon, I have lived in this area for about a year, and I go to SaveMart and Lakeside Grill , and never saw this place before.   It does say nails on the sign, but that is it, I thought it was associated with great clips Next door to it.  My nails were in horrible shape only after a week at another salon, and someone recommended this one.  What is family owned since 2001 and I am so glad to have found it. Everyone of the Staff inside introduced themselves to me which I was so happy. They were very appreciative that I was there as were the other customers.   Anna worked very hard fixing my nails.  She did a great job and I am so happy to have a new salon to do my nails and it's way closer.   At the other place I used to go to, they would just wave say pick your color and I was just like a herd of cattle coming in there and going out the door and they would take my money.   I was really surprised that all of the staff introduced themselves, way to go.  Nice!!! They now have my business.  Thanks Escape Nails."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"THE nicest spa experience I have ever had, period. Thanks to my mother-in-law for being so thoughtful to get us gift certificates for Christmas! We finally used them yesterday for the ""Duet Massage"", two massage tables in one room. Kim and Francesca were fabulous massage therapists who gave us both well-pressured massages that left us feeling relaxed and blissful.

The other reviews all seemed to touch on the same similar level of pampering upon arrival. You are given a huge robe once you are shown to the changing/shower room, plus some spa footwear, and a locker so you can lock up your clothes and shoes, etc.. You are shown the relaxation lounge where you can fill out your paperwork and enjoy a beverage. The massage therapists then led us to the room and proceeded to blow our minds with 50 minutes of perfectly applied pressure combined with a few surprise hot towels, and some much needed stress relieving. (We decided immediately afterwards that we NEEDED to budget for this at least twice a year, AT LEAST!!)

The shop in the entrance/check-out area stocks a nice variety of potions and salts so you can bring the spa experience home with you, or maybe do a little gift shopping, for yourself! The whole experience was a delightful indulgence and I can't wait to go back!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Well, my girlfriend and I just left this nail salon and it was a bittersweet experience. We both went in for pedicures, and they were very nice and accommodating. Our nails came out great. 

However, as we are paying, my girlfriend realizes she doesn't have her sunglasses. She definitely had them when we came in. 
So the people who work there were really nice and helped us look around the salon, but no one can find them. She knows she left them on the magazine stand by the nail colors and the owner says he would look at the security footage to see if they can help find the glasses. He's gone for a bit, and comes back out and tells us that he can't definitively say someone took them, but to come back and look at the footage. So we see my girlfriend with her glasses and she sets them down (out of view) to pick out a color and goes back to her chair. 

It's obvious that someone took the glasses, but unfortunately, people are shitty and think they deserve peoples property. 

Moral of the story: even though she didn't get her glasses back, we felt the owner and staff went above and beyond to help us and it was really appreciated. Plus our nails came out looking great."

I enjoy working out at this gym most of the staff is very friendly. However, today I was at the gym and I always use the shower after my workout as I go right to work. One of the employees was cleaning the ladies locker room as I was getting ready. She just cleaned the showers, that sucks that I had to use them I know. But, she was complaining about it to another employee right in front of me to the point that I felt uncomfortable and awkward. She then proceeded to talk about it out on the floor with another employee. I re-cleaned the shower stall I used because at first I felt bad. Now, however I am angry. This employee is very rude, disrespectful and unprofessional. I'm sorry but it is part of your job to clean the shower stalls and sometimes they are going to get used right after you clean them. You can complain about your job all you want it's part of life, but DO NOT do it in front of a customer, especially the customer you are complaining about. It's a shame because I do really like this gym."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I love this place, it's not wide open like most salons I have been to that make you feel like a specimen on display for every patron to judge in their own mind. This place is warm and inviting. Every stylist is very friendly, even if the stylist isn't the one providing you with the service they still recognize you and welcome you as if you were their client.

Amber N. is the one who takes care of my hair needs and let's just say SHE ROCKS!!! Some people cut hair because it's a job and some people cut hair because they are truly gifted at what they do. Well Amber is one of the gifted ones. Sure you might be saying ""you're a male, how difficult could it be..."" but don't be fooled, this hair is angel hair that is ultra fine, holds no shape, and has hidden cowlicks that spring up around every corner. Whether I give her freedom to do what she wants or I tell her exactly what I want, she delivers every time. And not only does she trim my hair, but she takes the time to educate me on products and techniques before sending me into the wild world of self-styling.

I highly recommend you make an appointment with Amber; man or woman. You will not be disappointed."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Make sure you check to make an appointment with the stylist you want!This is a great place for a haircut. The people are friendly and the place is clean. The only thing that I didn't like is that they try to push you to buy packages for some people. I also don't like that they have the option to make a sale if you don't want to buy any packages. I had to ask for a specific package on my phone and they couldn't see me until I paid for it. I'd be happy to try out other places. I had a great experience at this salon. They were friendly and welcoming. My stylist was great. She did a wonderful job on my cut and color. The salon is very clean and cute. Will definitely be back!I was in town for work and decided to treat myself to a pedicure. I had a wonderful experience. The woman that did my pedicure was extremely gentle, careful, and thorough. My toes and feet look great. The salon was very clean and nicely decorated. The pedicure was very relaxing."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"How has no one reviewed this place yet? Oh right, I think it's because no one in Illinois in this area really knows about Yelp... poop.

Anyway, I love the Inkwell. I'm almost 27, but when i was 18 I went there to get my belly button pierced and the dudes were really nice. Last summer, my friends and I tried to go in on a Saturday but they were so packed that we decided not to get any tattoos. The dudes were still really nice even though they were slammed. Then I went back there a while ago and got an anchor tattoo and the dudes were really nice again. Oh, not to mention they did great work. Several people were getting tattoos while I was there and they all turned out great. A friend of mine got a huge full-back tattoo at the Inkwell and it's absolutely gorgeous. 

I also just like it when tattoo artists aren't huge douchebags. 

As for the cost, isn't any place considered ""pricey"" if they do great work? I would even say this place is on the lower pricey side.

Oh, and one last thing, don't let the look of the place from the outside deter you. It's kind of a hole, but it's clean and they are very professional. I will definitely go back for future tattoos."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Just finished with another fantastic hair color & cut! Thank you Patty & girls!!! 
have been coming here for many years.  The ladies here are fantastic.  Betty always greets you with a smile.  Patty &. Debbie are one of the few hairstylists that actually take the time to go over your hair BEFORE it is washed.  If you have a specific style in mind, they really execute it to perfection.  If you aren't sure what you want, they'll take the time to share what style or shape might work best with your type of hair.  If you need a color, these are your girls!! They know what works and what doesn't.  Having your hair or any other service done is always an experience.  The salon is full of laughter and great music.  When I leave this salon, I always feel great.  I receive many compliments on my hair from co-workers and strangers alike. I have never hesitated to recommend them to friends and coworkers when they have been looking for a salon home.  The girls here have been here for almost 20 years, so you don't have to worry about showing up one day and not recognizing anyone. If you are looking for a salon, look no further - THIS IS IT!!!"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Saw this spot opened up not too long ago and decided to have a girls day and include this place as part of the day. 

The location is in a prime place and easy to get to with plenty of parking. 

I made an appointment online for 9:30 which is the time they open on Saturdays. We were sat right away when we walked in which is nice. They have tons and tons of colors that don't look old and used up. They have 2 big screens and good music playing. There are around 20 pedicure chairs although not that many people working, at least not this early. They offer you wine, champagne or water as well. I had the champagne which was actually good! 

The tech I had was very through. She made good conversation but not too much where it was annoying. 

I do recommend making an appointment. Several people came without one and had to wait maybe 20 minutes since they don't have a ton of staff. 

I drove about 30 minutes to get here (I live downtown and they are in Fishers) but it was worth the drive. Loved the finished product and it is what's mail shop should be, relaxing, drinks, music, tv just to have something on and feel pampered. My only complaint is there isn't one downtown!!!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I work at a hospital and due to an emergency I didn't get out until late missing my appointment to get my nails done at another salon with my sister in law (the bride who's getting married Sunday) and the rest of the bridesmaids. By the time I arrived back into the area it was 6:15pm. I was frantic to find a salon that was still open and who could give me a pedicure and gel manicure. Upon arrival to Chesco Nails I was greeted by all of the friendly staff. I immediately asked them if it was possible for me to get both services done as I knew it was late and they closed at 7pm. The staff laughed and reassured me not to worry and to choose my color.  Let me tell you this was one of the best pedicures I have ever had. They use the hot stones to massage my legs and feet and overall are so caring and professional. They did not rush through my pedi or my manicure making me feel welcome and helping to soothe my anxiety for missing my prior appointment. I highly recommend Chesco Nails and will be going to them for now on. Thank You ladies and gentlemen of Chesco Nails you helped a bridesmaid in crisis and I absolutely love my Nails!
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I saved up to get a tattoo and the girl at the front desk was very nice and helpful. I had an idea of what I wanted and she drew out a design that I wanted. She was very friendly and helped me pick out a color. I was very happy with the work and the price. I will definitely be back!I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very unprofessional. I showed her a picture of what I wanted, which I was not going to do because it was so hard to get exactly what I wanted. She was not willing to do what I wanted, which I have never experienced at any other salon. She kept telling me she would have to do it in 3 hours. I explained that she was not willing to do it. She said she would have to get me to come back the next day and get it fixed. I explained that I had a Groupon and she said it would take about an hour. She said no problem. I said no problem, she was there."

However, the last time I went in for a full set of acrylics, I was charged $60. I got them done and I had to go back to have them redone. I have no idea how this is supposed to happen, but I was charged $60.00 for a fill and a refill. I was very upset. The lady who did my nails did a terrible job on my nails, and they were so thick that I needed to have them redone."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Peppermill Hotel and Casino is my go to place in Reno.   I only go to one other Hotel and Casino nearby GSR.   I have been playing slots and tables for many years.  I enjoy the fun, lights and the people at Peppermill.  I love the Tuscany tower suites.  

But over the last two years (maybe more) I noticed the casino changed its slot games payouts.  It is like the slots have been adjusted not to payout as much as it use to.  I use to get handpays but it seems to dropped off.   In the past, I didn't mind that I lost some money as it was for all the entertainment.  But now I lose at a very rapid rate.  I dropped so much money into slots I am embarrassed, and its in the thousands in one night even when I dropped my bet size.   I know the slot manufacturers set the payouts and the casino has the ability to adjust it as well.  So it looks like the casino is on a profit taking run.  Its starting to be NO fun.  But I still like the hotel suites, restaurants , and people.  I'll need to adjust my fun budget because it isn't as fun anymore."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I will not return to this place. I was referred by someone who spoke highly of this place. I was so excited to go only to be let down. I went on a Sunday prior to leaving for Vacation. I went to get a Gel manicure and pedicure. I picked out  gel color for my nails and asked if a color could be matched with my feet. After the assistant helped me find a color my toes were painted. I advised the worker that the color was too dark and I did not like it. She brushed me off and went on to do my nails. After getting my nails done but before paying I again mentioned the color on my toes and how I did not like it. I asked to speak with the manager who never came to talk to me. The assistant went over and spoke briefly to the manager and she bluntly stated ""that is the color she picked"". I paid for my services and left. One and a half days into my vacation my nail polish started to peel by day four all of the polish was peeling. The service and quality of this place is not good. I will not return or refer anyone to this place. Yes the gloves are a good deal but the service sucks."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I got a Groupon for a keratin treatment.  Went in for the treatment.  Everything seemed ok, but my hair was not soft and smooth like it was with my keratin treatment at a different salon last year. I was told to wait 72 hours to wash my hair. I waited 72 hours and used the shampoo and conditioner that they sold me for $40! My hair was extremely dry, and the ends were totally kinky, brittle,Very dry and very damaged.
I called the salon, they told me to come back. 
They gave me a deep conditioning treatment and said I'd be fine. Wrong!!!!!!after my next washing my hair was still horribly damaged. 
I'm beyond upset. I had to go to another salon and was told my have was chemically damaged, and the only way to fix it was to cut my hair short and get off as much as the damaged hair as possible.  I had no choice,  so I'm stuck with short hair that still has some damage.  I was growing my hair out for the past 2 years.  Back to square one.  I'm very upset that my hair was damaged, and the only thing the salon did was a conditioning treatment.  
I learned the hard way. Know who you are letting do any treatment on your hair!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Found Hollywood Nails thanks to other Yelpers and wanted to just get a good gel pedicure because I'm super pregnant and don't want to deal with my toes at all. I was able to call and get an appointment after work very easily and get my gel pedi for $30! A total steal. 

As I arrived in the plaza there was plenty of parking and only a handful of ladies inside so I was seated right away. One of the main reasons I do not like getting my nails done is because of how time consuming it all is! You wait to get them done, you wait for the polish to dry, you wait to pay......I just can't deal with it. THANKFULLY this was NOT the case! I was in and out in about 30 minutes with great looking tootsies. 

There was no pain in the removal of my cuticles or dead skin. I also was given a sugar scrub on my legs and a hot stone leg massage as part of my pedi! The only reason I do not give this place the full 5 stars is because it does look a bit dated (including the massage pedicure chair that didn't function properly) and many of the nail stations were messy looking. I do look forward to coming back and trying out a manicure too."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"If you are interested in getting a lash lift I DO NOT suggest coming here. I spent $100 and received zero results. I have naturally long eyelashes, even the girl who did the lash lift said I was a good candidate for it and she said ""I love doing lashes like yours""... When she first showed me the results I was caught off guard because I truly did not see a change then I thought maybe I should just go home and wait a little to see if they needed to set or something? I got it done yesterday and I literally look EXACTLY the same as when I came in. I am super disappointed that I wasted my money and my sisters wedding is tomorrow, I could of spent that money on lash extensions. I decided to call and let them know about my experience. I spoke to the manager Candice? which I think is the woman who did my lash lift too because she said she was the manager. All she could offer me was to wait 4 weeks and they will cover for me to have it done again. I said okay and she hung up on me, didn't take my name or write down any of my information. I've never been so annoyed in my life. What a waste of time and money."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I absolutely adore this place! They have been so amazing to my girls, I couldn't be happier with the experiences we've had. Plus, they're super reasonably priced, which helps when you don't have a ton to spend.

My youngest (14mo) had her first hair cut with Sam and it turned out great. Not only did she NOT butcher my daughter's hair, but she made it enjoyable for her and she was so patient and sweet. We went again and had another great experience with a different stylist. Of course I'm terrible with names and I forget the second woman's name, but I'll have to ask next time!

I've seen reviews that said it was kind of dingy inside, which I mean... no it's not the cleanest or newest, but it's a place for your kid to get their hair cut people. There's HAIR everywhere because that's all they do all day. None of these places are impeccably clean. Idk, maybe don't let your kid lick the floor? Or do. Whatever works for you. But it's kind of ridiculous to give a place that you're only inside for 15 minutes 1 star over it being outdated or there being hair all over.

We recently moved out of the area and I've been driving 25 minutes to take the kids here still, so I guess you could say I definitely recommend it!"

I told her it was a basic manicure and she just went ahead and tried to charge me $10 more. I told her I had no idea what I wanted and she said I would have to pay extra for it. I was just in a rush to get out of there so I was just trying to get out of there. I had to pay for it and now I have to go back for it to be fixed.

Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Let me start with the fact that there was no running water. We had a party of twelve that was schedule for massages and a aromatherapy foot  scrub. Prior to our visit no one contacted us to explain the circumstances. We were not aware of the issues until 30 minutes after our arrival which was 9:30 am.  The owner was not there and avoided numerous attempts to speak with us.  The staff on the other hand did a Great job with limited supplies. They made a terrible situation work to the best of their ability. They had to purchase bottle water and warm it on a heater for the foot soaks. They were professional in every way possible. I would never want to work under those circumstances. The owner refused to discount the bill even after the staff made her aware of the issues. Money was not the issue at all but when people pay good money they expect good service.  Not only was there no water, they were short staffed as well. The ratio  was 3:12. We were late for our next schedule event which was lunch. Four from our party were not able to get the full service as schedules. I would NEVER go back there again and I would not recommend this place to anyone. Wouldn't even go for free."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I'm so sad because I went here to have a girls night with some friends after work, and came away so disappointed. One friend made an appointment, so they knew five of us would be coming together, and still they were not prepared. We all sat down at the nail bar at the same time, and the four others in my party got their manicures started right away. Meanwhile, I sat there for almost 25 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge that I was waiting or that they would be right with me, which they didn't. Finally, someone finished the manicure of one of my friends and came to start helping me; she filed the nails of one hand and then walked off and I waited another five minutes for someone else to come and finish my manicure. By this time, all the people I came with were all finished with their manicures, and I was still in the middle of mine. Another woman came and chatted with the people of my party and provided them with hot stone shoulder massages as well, which looked lovely. I didn't get to experience that, as everyone was in a hurry to close up and skipped my massage, again, no acknowledgement or apology. The service here was inconsistent, at best, and extremely deplorable. I will definitely not be visiting here again."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I had been coming to this place for years and never had a bad experience. I went in to get a full set and the lady was very rough with my hands. She cut me twice with the drill and she was very rough with the cuticle. I don't know how this place gets a 2 star because I will never go back. I have been to a lot of nail salons in Tucson, but I have found it to be very frustrating to find a place that does not provide a relaxing experience for a basic manicure. I went in for a basic manicure and a pedicure and the lady who did my pedicure was not very friendly. I had to ask her to do my nails a bit. I went in for a gel manicure and it was $45. I went back the next day for a gel pedicure. The lady who did my pedicure was not very friendly and didn't even apologize. She did not paint my nails the way I asked her to. She painted them very thick and didn't file them well. I was so frustrated with the manicure."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I had really great expectations for this place, but it fell short. The manager Scott was very nice but was too distracted. He would make a conversation with me and then pick up the phone while I was talking, which was very rude. Then he asked me for my contact info since it was my first time and he picked up the phone AGAIN while I was talking. One of the most important rules of customer service is to serve the customer that you have right in front of you! 

The lady with the ombré hair doing my nails was ok. She was pretty rude. I never get my nails done so the whole experience just sucked. The other person getting a pedicure next to me had a great person who actually made a conversation with her. To be honest, I don't care if the lady talked to me but I thought it was weird that she talked to everyone else BUT me. 

My nails turned out ok as well. The host told me I was getting gel on my nails but it was just regular nail polish. The lady made my nail polish all lumpy so it didn't even dry well. The only thing I liked about this place was that there was a bar. I should have just got my nails done at Wal-Mart and saved money."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"My sister, aunt and I went on a Friday afternoon after calling to check availability. We were told they could accommodate us right away. When we walked in, we were ushered to specific chairs, my water was run for my pedicure- and then I sat for 30 min before being helped. I asked for the deluxe pedicure, but I'm not sure what made it ""deluxe."" After my toes were painted I sat for about ten minutes while my nails dried, and then left. When I got home about 30 min later I looked down and found three smudged toes.  At this point my sitter needed to leave, but I didn't want to keep a messed up pedicure. I went back with my son and sat for another 20 min before I was helped. She fanned my toes this time, I waited under the lights for about 5 min but needed to leave. Thirty minutes later my son stepped on my toe, and it smudged again.
I'm most disgruntled because I should have been told before I was seated that there would be a wait. And also, the polish for my particular color was obviously old or thick or something - which can't be helped, but nonetheless, it was not a great experience. 
We were also not offered a beverage, though the customers next to us had been offered one."

I always feel very comfortable. I highly recommend the salon. I love that they have a parking lot in the back. I have been going here for over 10 years. I love the location and the service.

I would definitely recommend this place. I just went there to get a massage and the massage was great! It's very clean and they provide a relaxing atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. 

However, I'm not sure if the people who work there are trained or not. I don't know if they're trained or not. They're not. I went in to get a deep tissue massage and it was a great experience!

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have been using this salon for over a year now and the service has been going down hill the last  three months.  First I had an appt. for a haircut with Whitney, the regular person that cuts my hair and I sat in a chair for 20 mins with a wet head and towel while she cut a walk in.  He, a very nice looking young man, came in 10 mins after I had arrived and tried to get another stylist to cut him but was turned down as she already had a client. Whitney took him in front of me even though I had this appt. for weeks. I will never return to her.  The second thing is my colorist, Marie, no longer works there and all my future appts that were set up had been changed to some random person I did not know. I have an appt. with Marie for Jan. 5th and I guess they would just let me walk in and find out that way that the ONLY person I have ever let color my hair is gone.
I am very picky about my hair and would never just let anyone cut or color it. I used this salon based on referrals as the person who cut my hair for 20 yrs retired, but I guess the search is on again."

I had a microdermabrasion with peel done and I had great results. I loved her so much she recommended me a VIPeel for my next treatment I paid when I was there made an appointment for a month and a half later . She called me the day before my appointment to confirm my appointment and gave me advice on what to do over night before my treatment, I had everything set up all my days off from work , I was so ready for my treatment, only to get few hours later a call from her manager Marijana that they run out of my VI peel , excuse me I thought I paid for it when I was there how you run out , well they got busy so they used my treatment on someone else ! That is bad business , I was prepared for this and took time off from work only to be very disappointed and try to find other spa around the are so I don't waste my days off ! I did get my money back but definitely very disappointed with how there office runs ! This wasn't fair to me ! I gave 3 stars only because Shannon is absolutely amazing."

She is extremely personable and very professional. I can't imagine going to anyone else now! I always get compliments on my hair! I also love the fact that she is a talented stylist. I just went to her for a color and cut. It was an amazing experience and I will be going to her again soon. I would recommend her to anyone who asks! She is so sweet and so sweet! I am so happy that I found her!I went in for a gel manicure and I was very pleased with the results. I went in for a gel manicure and it was $45. I went in with a very long, natural looking gel manicure and the lady took off a few nails that were really short and didn't even cover them with nail polish. I had to go back in and get them fixed but they charged me $15 for a gel manicure. I will never go back there again."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Awful place, incredibly rude. I've been to the Brow Art 23 in the Brandon Mall and Tyrone Mall many times with great results. This location however, is completely different. I tried to visit last Friday, and there was a line of 2 people ahead of me at about 5pm. I asked how log. The wait was and a girl about 18 told me after the next two people they were both going on a break and closing the store until 6:15, so come back then. I wait until 6:15 and return to see a sign saying they will return at 6:45. No why both go on a break at the same time is beyond me, but the two girls were both in the store using their cell phones and giggling. I said ""you told me to return at 6:15"" the girl just shrugged, then looked at the other girl and giggled then said come back later and returned to looking down at her phone. 

I waited another half hour and came back at 6:45. At this time, their sign was changed to returning at 7pm. The girl said ""we're still on a break and giggled.

They clearly don't want business, or are unfortunately taking advantage of the owner who probably is unaware. Needless to say, I will never return to this location, and hope their manager finds out about their rude behavior."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Ok so the place is far from great, but you get what you pay for. A Groupon for $50 gave me what was supposed to be an hour massage, an hour facial, and a spa manicure. What I got was a 45 minute massage, a 30 minute facial, and a color change. All of that was nice for $50, but WOW I would be screaming like a kid at Halloween Horrow Nights if I had to pay full price for it. 

 It was supposed to be a Swedish relaxation massage. Every time he found a knot, he asked me to upgrade and pay more to get a deep tissue massage. When I would say no, he wouldn't work on the know anymore. I don't know if that's the industry standard, but of the dozens of massages I've had, that has never happened. 

The facial was literally two creams and that was it. The girl was nice but it was not an hour. 

Finally the manicure- the worst I have ever had! It was supposed to be their best manicure, it literally wasn't even as nice as a polish exchange at a low-end suburbs nail salon. 

Like I said, for $50 I am not that upset. It was nice for the money. Still, I wouldn't recommend it without the Groupon and with it, it's still hard to say go for it."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Dear Peppermill,

I reluctantly went to the Atlantis and let them know I was not happy with the way the hotel is run. The front desk girl told me that if I had a problem, that it was my fault. She said that they were busy but I had to reschedule with the person who did my reservation. I was furious. She told me that I could go to the hotel and get my money back from the hotel. I told her I had to stay there to get my money back, and she offered me a free upgrade. I just wanted to get my money back from the hotel. I left. I would never stay here again. I have been to a few other nail salons in the area and I have finally found my go to!  I have been to many different nail salons over the years and this is by far the best one I have been to in my entire life. My nails always look great and they are reasonably priced. The salon is very clean and nicely decorated. The staff is always friendly and accommodating."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Couldn't find the negative -5 Stars option so I have to settle for a 1 star review.
Worst haircut of my life!!! 3 years of growing out my hair lost in 10mins. Told them exactly what I wanted and even showed 4 pictures of what I wanted done and still destroyed my head. And dude was trying to blame the picture. Pointing out ""he has a beard in the picture""? What the hell dose that have to do with a simple taper?
Don't do it. You will feel pissed you went like me.
And I guarantee the people giving them 5 starts are friends and family trying to help them out.

Answer to Reply: lol, NO THANKS. Not making that mistake twice. "" Misunderstood us""? ""Brought to our attention""? What the hell are you talking about? Why even reply? To save face? Because it's not like y'all could fix it anyway, damage is done. That is of course you could grow my hair back out in 10min. Yeah think not. See, problem is with what y'all do there is that there is no ""fixing it"" when you screw something up the way y'all did.
Originally I wasn't going to post pictures of how bad it is but scenes you think it's something that could be ""fixed"" I will just show everyone who is thinking of heading your way (no pun intended) how bad y'alls work truly is."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Hello. I have gone to Skinjectibles since they opened and to Katie before that when she worked at a different office.  Katie (owner) has a great eye and does really nice work.  The prices have really gone up over the years. Many friends have said the same thing.  I'd guess I have spent an average of  10K+ per year with them. But I was okay with that because good work deserves good pay. Unfortunately, I will no longer be going to Skinjectibles because they have repeatedly been late (or very late) even though I always had an appointment. One time I sat in the lobby for over an hour.  There have been times when they run on time but many other occasions when I have waited for 30-45 minutes. That would be okay if someone at the front desk (there were 5+ staff members standing around today) would have let me know and offered me some water or something.  Ironically, there was a cheese platter and sparkling wine sitting out in the lobby. I asked if the refreshments were for clients and got a ""oh sure"" answer. I decided to leave after waiting for 25 minutes. I'm in a customer service oriented business and there is no way my clients would put up with waiting more than 10 minutes without at least an apologetic phone call."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Had a couple of free time to kill and needed a pedicure before my vacation.  I came in at the same time, and they said they would do a great job.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The pedicure was fine.  The chair was not comfortable.  The woman who was working on my toes did not have the capacity to speak English.  She did not speak very well.  I am not sure if I will be back, but I will not be back.  I would suggest you call ahead, since they are busy.  This place is a bit pricey but it is worth it.  I would not recommend this place.  The only reason I gave it a 5 star is because of the massage chairs.  I was a little worried that they wouldn't work with the massage table, but I was a little worried about the fact that it would not work.

I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes before my appointment time and was seated for my manicure. I was seated for my pedicure. When I went to pay, they told me they didn't have any cash. I was a little shocked by the price point and was given a ""top coat"" to choose from. I was then told I was given a ""top coat"" which was nice. I was told that ""top coat"" would only be $20. I went to my regular salon and was charged $45 for a top coat. The next day I had to take off my polish because the color was so thick that it was so thick and was very thin. I had to the polish all over"
Beauty & Spas,1.5,OR,"Over priced to start off with, that is only the first issue.  I walked in for a powder manicure, and was priced $35.  Kind of expensive but if it really lasts 3 weeks, okay.  So I agree, and was reassured it was a full manicure.  However, the nail tech did not do any manicure treatments, only gave my nails a quick shaping and started applying the acrylic/powder.  No cuticle pushing, no moisturizing, no hand massage, nothing.  The acrylic is really thick, I think she used too many coats.  Next was my pedicure, which was fair at best.  Nothing great nothing really terrible.  Just overpriced for the lack of massaging and attention to detail.  The worst part was the constant yelling between manager/owner/employees.  The male tech and another tech were yelling at each other in Vietnamese my ENTIRE time there.  I don't mind people speaking their home language at all, totally used to it.  What bothered me was the yelling, back and forth across the salon, one person pacing and using huge arm movements to make some kind of point, and the next person following suit.  I'm not sure what the arguing was about, but it was extremely disruptive.  This was my second time here, the first time was not terrible but not great either.  Won't be back."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"If I could give a zero rating I would. One star is extremely too generous for the service I received at the Blo Magazine Street location. This was my second visit to this Blo and I am very disappointed with the time and money I wasted here today. During my initial visit at this location, I was fortunate to receive excellent service from Ebony which is why I returned. When I rescheduled my second appointment I was told Ebony would not be available and I'd be seeing another stylist. I made it very clear that I wanted a stylist who had specific experience and was told on the phone all of Blo stylists were experienced with all textures of hair. This was not the case today. When the stylist finished with my hair today and asked if I liked it, I in return asked her if she was finished and she stated yes. I've never had to ask a hairstylist if they were finished because it was always clear that they were and if I wasn't satisfied they offered to do something different and ensure I left pleased with their service. Not here. After paying for terrible service and explaining why I was so unsatisfied to the front desk employee, I asked to speak with the manager and was told I'd have to wait twenty minutes because she was with a client. Unacceptable."

I will definitely be back!I went to this nail salon for the first time today and I was happy with my experience. I got a gel manicure and it was done well.

Very bad experience.  I realize Empire is a school so there is a chance for error. That being said I believe students should have someone present to monitor their work, at least until they show the capability to preform on their own.
I went in for a cut and brow wax.
The stylist was just leaving for lunch so I choose to wait the half hour for her to return. She said she would be ready in a minute, she didn't return to waiting area for me another girl finally escorted me back.
She motioned me to sit. Her attitude was not welcoming (I should have left at this point). I ask her if this was a bad time and she had said no. (It was at least for me).
I wanted longer layers and to my shoulders.
I have no idea what she did but I came in with hair past my shoulders and left with it an inch below my ears. 
She called the instructor over who then had to spend over an hour trying to make something presentable out of what the student had done.
This was a bad experience but made me feel as if it was my fault. The student repeatly used the phrase ""her hair"". She never apologized for her obvious mistake and her rude behavior. 
If you get a bad vibe here, heed it's warning don't make excuses for someones behavior."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I absolutely LOVE this spa!  I booked online, because well, I avoid phone calls whenever I can, so that was a handy feature.  The receptionist who greeted me at the spa was so pleasant, though, I may just call next time!  Bryna is AMAZING!  She waxed my brows and upper lip with minimum discomfort, and the best part is she is a genuinely warm person.  Matthew was my masseuse.  It was one of the best massages ever.  Of course, to me, massage is like sex, if you're getting it, it's never bad!  But there are varying degrees of good, and Matthew was at the top.  I truly felt healed.  To start, he gave me permission to let go for an hour and focus only on healing my body and rejuvenating my soul.  Why is it that we need permission to do this?  I don't know, but I took his advice.  As some of the reviews said, you can hear background voices, but it was very minimal and didn't affect me at all.  The spa was warm and friendly and inviting.  Now, if you are looking for a posh, fancy, elite, rich spa, this is probably not for you, but I liked it precisely because it made me feel so comfortable.  

I will definitely return here for my indulgence."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"i went to Kristy because of reviews I read on here and city search, but I have to say I was really disappointed with the outcome of my hair. She was very attentive and listened for 20 minutes in the beginning of my appointment and said she could do exactly what I asked for- which I thought was pretty amazing and had me feeling really good about going to her. I get blonde highlights and lowlights and asked her for frosted, cool colors and that I wanted absolutely no warmth, gold or brassiness. As soon as she dried my hair I was horrified. There were light red streaks going through the top of my hair! The complete opposite of what I wanted. She obviously noticed and then tried to backtrack telling me ""Well, what I asked for was hard it would take several times to get what I asked for.""...Um that's not what you told me in the beginning. My hair is the goldest and brassiest it's been in a long time- not sure how that happened when I gave her several pictures of what I wanted and what I didn't want and I ended up with the exact color of a ""didn't want"" photo.

Being attentive in the beginning is only good if you end up giving the results the client asks for in the end. 

And she was expensive! Most expensive mess up ever."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"DO NOT GO HERE!!! I started going to this salon a few months ago. At first it was great and I thought I finally found the perfect salon. My mom and I had made an appointments with specific nail techs weeks ahead of time. When we got there for the appointments we were told that the lady doing my moms nails was not there but my lady was. I waited in the pedicure chair for about an hour. While I was sitting in the chair the lady was just sitting in the front on her phone... when a new costumer walked in, she jumped up and started working on their nails. I was very frustrated at this point. finally someone came over and started my pedicure. he was very distracted and he started filing the side of my toe. No surprise he filed off my skin and my toe started bleeding. At this point he still wasn't paying attention and i had to make him aware that my toe was bleeding!! He said to me ""your skin is too thin"" he never said sorry or anything. He also only did about 1/4 of my pedicure because he didn't want to rub off anymore of my skin. When he was done I was very unhappy w the pedicure BUT he still charged me full price even tho I had to leave w bandaids on my toe."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I got my hair done by Mrs. Brenda about three weeks ago. I wanted to wait until I washed my hair to give a full and honest review. I found this salon on yelp and decided to give it a try after reading all the great reviews. 

I had a great experience! I am fully natural with mid back length hair and that wasn't an issue for Brenda. She washed, deep conditioned, blew dry, straightened, and cut my hair. She did a great job!! She took her time and was gentle throughout the whole process. I was amazed how straight and healthy my hair looked when she was done. I was able to keep my hair straight for almost 3 weeks. I received so many compliments on my hair. 

I was a little nervous that I had heat damage, not because she used a lot of heat, but because she was able to get my hair bone straight. I've never had a stylist get my natural hair to get that straight and last for 3 weeks! That's why I wanted to wait to give a review to see if my curls would come back. They are back and are looking better than ever!!! No heat damage and my hair didn't shed as much as it usually does on wash days.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Having lived in Tampa Palms since 1989 and then just 3 Miles down the road as a USF student since 1980, Ive seen ALL the businesses come and go and very few have withstood the test of time, with Happy Nails being one of the few that has been here since the 90s. Even many of the techs have been here for over 10 years and the great owner Lee (and wife Kimmy who actually went to high school with my daughter) remain to the satisfaction of our small community. It has served as a ""gathering spot"" for Tampa Palms through the years and I've NEVER been in without seeing many acquaintances. Lee never forgets a face (and rarely a name) and the salon is now doing nails for the young daughters of their original high school customers. The salon has expanded thru the years with new, comfortable Pedi chairs being added as well as a square foot expansion. Their services are always consistent with prices comparable to other places in the area. Of course their reputation has continued to grow and customers now drive in from all over New Tampa. They stay busy all the time and during popular times there will be a wait, but they take reservations or Lee will give you a ""return time"" so that you are not inconvenienced.  To me this is the very best local business in our area."

The girl behind the desk was new and couldn't answer my question so she called the owner which was very nice and helpful but the water doesn't get ""changed"" only filtered, I took her on her word that the filtration process sufficiently
cleaned the water after each use. It's kinda like a hot tub situation expect your suppose to float in the nude.But apparently the water is not changed after each customer. I decided to try and  I'm really sorry to say this and I hope my review will help this business stay afloat if they change their methods but I found the changing area to be dusty, especially the floor and some viable dusty bunnies lingering in corners, it needed a good sweep and mopping, I didn't feel comfortable getting undressed. I took a peak at the float tank and found that unappealing as well as I saw what looked to be human hair floating on the waters surface. I hope the business can sustain itself with a little more attention to detail as this a rather inmate body/health venture and some local business should provide better services then the giants. Two stars for being there and providing a service which at least some seem to enjoy."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"It is what it is.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the massage therapists here are not very good.  I have been to a couple other places in the area and this is by far the worst massage I've had.  This is my first massage ever and I was looking forward to it.  I was very disappointed and didn't think the massage was worth it.  This place is not a spa.  It's a little pricey, but worth it for the quality of work.  The massage was really nice and I was actually not feeling the pain at all.  They also offer a rewards program, which is nice.  It's a very good deal for someone who does a good job.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants a good massage.I went here with a friend for the first time today. We were greeted warmly and was seated immediately. We sat down right away and the women who did our nails did a great job. The owner was very sweet and helpful. She was very personable. The salon was very clean and had great selection of colors. The pedicure was very relaxing and I loved it."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"Never. Again. 
This isn't really a place you want to try out. 

The person who did my pedicure was nice, but the massage was not great. She cut me twice with the tool and then moved on to the manicure. My nails look like they had been painted by a 2 year old. I did get a very minimal massage on my hands and I could have done a better job myself. I was pretty disappointed. 

I won't be back. 

Update: I went back again, and the woman who did my nails was nice, but the paint job was awful. She cut my cuticles too short, which was a big disappointment. I did have a nice, relaxing time, but I would not recommend this place.This is my favorite nail salon! I have been going to the same lady for over a year and she is AMAZING! I always get the dip powder and it lasts for a good 3 weeks. The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable.I always get my nails done here and I always get my nails done by Tina. She is the best nail techs."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I work in Center City and was having bad tooth pain today and wanted to see someone right away. I called this practice to see if they had an appointment available today so I could find out what was going on with my tooth. I only told the receptionist who answered the phone that I was having tooth pain and wanted to be seen. She said she had to go consult with the doctor. I was put on hold for a reasonable amount of time and when she came back she told me I had two options: that I could get a root canal if I wanted to ""save my tooth"" or that I could get the tooth extracted. I found this these options to be very extreme, especially because they had not seen the tooth or conducted any x-rays to determine what was wrong with it. I have never had a cavity before and it could have been that or my wisdom teeth attempting to come in, but they did not even consider these options when jumping to the conclusion of root canal or extraction. I was very unimpressed by this scare tactic used, especially because I know how pricey root canals can be. From the reviews, it seems like Dr. Eidelson is a good dentist but I would just be wary when calling and make sure you get a consultation before partaking in an expensive procedure."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"If I could review this with no stars I would.  I have given it two tries now and will not return.  The first time it was a  matter of just not being satisfied with my shellac manicure.  My nails were not filed a consistent shape and there was a ""bubble"" on one fingernail. 

The worst was my recent visit for a pedicure.  The man who did it was rude, aggressive, and cursed at me.  I asked him to cut my nails and not file them because he was hurting me as he filed.  The edge of the file was abrasive on my skin.  I've never had that happen before.  When I asked if he could cut them instead he got very offended and was quite rude.  

When you get a pedicure you expect to relax and enjoy yourself.  This was like punishment.  When I went to leave he actually cursed at me.

The lady at the check out desk apologized.  I asked her if he was the owner because I couldn't imagine that they would retain an employee who was rude to the customers.  She said he was not.

He still works there, however, because he sits outside the shop when I pass the building on Kennedy and I see him there frequently.  I wondered why this place is always empty.  Now I know."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"I don't even know where to begin, but I just know how to make a reservation! 

I have had facials, waxing, and hair extensions. The staff is so friendly and professional. I highly recommend this spa for facials. I always feel welcome and comfortable with the staff. I have also had massages, and have never had a bad experience. They are very reasonably priced, with very reasonable prices. They also have a great selection of products for purchase. 

I highly recommend the Naked Peach, and I am so glad I did!I have been here twice and have had good experiences both times. The first time I went to get a full set of acrylics and was given a ""top coat"" to choose from. I was then seated for my pedicure and the technician was not even with me until after my nails dried. I had to ask her to clean them up and I had to ask her to stop. After I had already washed my hands and the technician went to the dryer for the color, it was still wet, which was not wet, and wet, and I had to ask her to dry my nails for"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"If I would have completed a more professional job, I would have left. I would have given them a 5 star rating but I will not be returning. I was very disappointed that I was given a gift card to try a new place. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes before my appointment time and was seated for my manicure. I was seated for my pedicure. When I went to pay, they told me they didn't have any cash. I was a little shocked by the price point and was given a ""top coat"" to choose from. I was then told that the nail technician would be with me shortly. I was going to pay but I didn't know what was going on with the service. I didn't get a good pedicure, but I'm sure that was just the technician's fault. I was then told to wait for my manicure to begin with, which was then told I would be there for a pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"If you go, make sure you're getting Ana for your services. I went on a Groupon deal because of all the great reviews about Ana, but Ana was out the day that I went, so I received a 40-ish minute massage (was supposed to be 60 minutes, but I didn't mind because I couldn't wait to get out of there) from someone else who worked there. The girl who gave me my massage looked completely unprofessional (jeans, low-cut shirt, barefoot...) which turned me off immediately but I tried to just close my eyes and enjoy the massage. Unfortunately, I couldn't do that either. I've had massages at the Four Seasons, Rittenhouse, Toppers, and a few other places, and this place didn't even come close. The room was so bright I couldn't even relax after closing my eyes, and the overly loud music made me feel like I was on a beach being attacked by seagulls. The massage itself was nothing special, my husband could've done the same and he's obviously not licensed or trained. And I want to be clear, I am in no way a ""massage snob"", I've loved massages at little cheap places just as much as the fancy expensive ones. This was just THE worst massage experience I've ever had, and I wanted to warn everyone to make sure to specially request this apparently wonderful Ana before you make the appointment. I sure wish I did!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Lexus is amazing with hair and I actually followed her to this location from a prior salon. Unfortunately, she wasn't available one day that I desperately needed to get in and I took a chance with another stylist, Jessica. She styled the hell out of it and was hesitant to let me see the back. When I got home I inspected the back. She had used the thinning shears so much, I almost looked bald! Considering the hard times we're living in, and knowing people were just getting back to work, I didn't want to get anyone in trouble. But I also couldn't live with my hair. I also didn't want her to touch it again! I called to get in with Lexus to fix it. Which she did wonderfully. Lexus gave me a discount on her usual price as a courtesy. But, unfortunately, I was out over $100. I called the owner, Jenna, to see if she would accommodate me in some way... A discount, anything. Any other salon I've ever been too would fix a bad hair cut! The owner would make it right. Jenna acted like I was bothering her and like she wasn't responsible for any of her stylists! She said she would have Jessica call me, which she never did. In the end, I was out over $100 for a cut that had to be fixed. Never again. Love Lexus, but not the salon."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I had a pretty good experience here, the girl who did my nails did a pretty good job. I had a very bad experience, but they're okay with it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I didn't have an appointment with my friend. Great salon with great service. I have been going here for several years. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. They offer a great selection of colors and the atmosphere is nice. I have a hard time finding a salon that is comparable to my home, so I will try out a few. I recommend this salon to everyone. I have been going to this location for a couple of years. I have had the pleasure of going to this location twice a year. I went in for a pedicure and it was great. I have a basic pedicure and the lady who did my pedicure was awesome. She really took her time and did a great job. I would definitely recommend this location. I'm not a fan of the decor, but I'm always happy with my nails. The staff is always so nice and accommodating. I always come here because I'm very happy with the service."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I thought leaving a review was an option. But I was wrong. I went in to get a full set of acrylics. The technician seemed annoyed that I was asking her to do a fill in. She cut me 3 times. She then proceeded to tell me that I would need a full set because I didn't want them to be too short. I asked if she could make my nails look like I had them long and she told me that it's not what I wanted. I explained that I wanted the coffin shape, and she proceeded to tell me that I had a fill in, and that it would be too short. She continued to do that. I asked her to fix them and she got upset and said she can't do the coffin shape I asked for. I was shocked and embarrassed, but she was really nice about it. She said "" well, I don't know why you couldn't do that"". I asked if she could fix the coffin shape. She said that she could do it, but I was asking for coffin shape, so I would have to be sure to ask for the coffin shape. I would like coffin shape. I said no longer."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Last week I came in for a dip manicure. I came back for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and the lady at the front desk was not happy about it. The color was not what I asked for and she was rushing. My nails look like they had been painted by a child. I was going to get a French tip and it was a little crooked. I didn't want to get them done anymore and asked if they could fix it. I got a gel manicure and it was $30. The lady that did my nails was nice but I didn't get what I wanted. I would have liked to have been charged $25 for a gel manicure and I would have gotten a regular manicure. It was a nice surprise to see how it turned out. I wish I had been aware of the price before going in. I paid $25 and they charged me $20. I did not get what I asked for. I will not be returning to this place. I've had many massages from multiple therapists and they all have been good. I've had a very good experience. The receptionist and was very nice and I loved her.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I hadn't been to Empire Nails since just after the current owner, Michelle, bought it some years back. I didn't see her there today. The shop was always clean and and the staff nice and professional. I went today for a scheduled mani-pedi and was pretty disappointed. The woman who did my pedicure (don't know her name) started by telling me she was ready ""now"" while I was picking out my 2 polish colors. The water in the plastic lined basin barely covered my feet, and was lukewarm at best with no water jets. .When she started filing my first foot's nails, she picked up an emory file that looked like it had been used on many others prior. I said something and she opened the drawer and opened a new one that she noted was ""shorter"". But it was also clean an unused! After this, she made a big show of pouring from a bottle labeled ""alcohol"" over the metal tools that did not appear to have been removed from a sterilizer. She kept pulling my feet to a position that caused me to have to been my ankles very uncomfortably. The end result is fine, but after the first five minutes I knew I wasn't getting that Manicure! Place was not clean, trash cans full, trash cans with lids stood with open lids, and there were at least 5 flies hovering around. Place is off my list now!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Went here because I bleached my hair, liked how my ends turned up and wanted a darker root smudge. Was told they couldn't do that, should of been a red flag. Decided on doing a 5m, she applied to my roots then ends. After rinsing I could tell the color didn't match all over. While she blow dried she ripped through my curly thick hair with a brush causing more breakage then I had from the bleach. After her blow dry I stated how the roots were orange and I would like a darker color, she stated that's the darkest they had. (Mind you I went to cosmetology school, I just work in the skin care field instead) telling me that a 5 m is the darkest brown (when it's really not) she kept asking me where I see orange and kept saying it was brown not orange. Then charged me $90 for her to slap a 5m on my head and do a rough dry. Said that's the cost for a color correction. You slathering a 5m all over someone's head is not a color correction. Didn't even style my hair or put heat protect in or anything. So now I'm at cosmoprof buying hair color to cover her HORRIBLE JOB! I should of just done it myself at home, thought I'd treat myself getting my hair done. Lol never again! 0 stars for the job, and her attitude"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I recently signed up to join Spa Lady again since I heard about their renovations so they now occupy 2 floors and my Zumba classes were being cancelled in my community hall.  Because I had been a member from a few years ago, I was able to get an awesome deal for a year! They have a great referral program too, where after my year contract, I pay $5/biweekly for 3 months for every person I refer.  My sister signed up and didn't get as good a contract as mine as it's been a while since she was a member but I'll get the great rate after a year and my friend gets the deal for referring me.

The renovations are great, and now this gym feels like a big spacious gym.  Downstairs, they have large lockers, washrooms, Spin classes, bigger group fitness room, large free weight area, and a few machines.  Upstairs, there's a circuit, lots of cardio machines, and stretch machines.  The locker area much bigger, there's a sauna, and nice and private showers.  The locker area is similar to another gym that I've been to but they don't have the hair products for you to use.

Love the classes, and they can get busy but not too crowded, and good idea to come a few minutes early to get a spot.  Am glad I signed up again, and for less than $25/month!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I would like to start by saying I am very picky about my hair, I have never been so pleased with the way it looks.  The staff is always so friendly and accommodating.  They take their time to make sure you are happy.  I always feel welcome and at ease.  I love my hair!  I have had many different stylists and they all do a great job.  They are extremely professional and friendly.  I have a hard time finding someone that can do my hair right now, but I will continue to go to this salon!  Thank you so much, Vicky!I have been going to this salon for years. It is the only salon I go to and I have to say it is the best place in town.  I have been coming here for a few years now.  I have had great experiences.  They are always on time, always have the latest nail polish colors and their prices are great.  I always come here and recommend it to everyone.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I like it.  Lets go with the fact that they take credit cards but it's a bit annoying.  I had to get cash before they said I had to pay.  I was charged $55 for a gel manicure which was about $40.  I was charged $60 for a gel manicure.  I will not be coming back.  I've heard great things about this place.  I won't be returning.I love this place! I go to Jessica for my nails and she is the best. I've never been disappointed with my nails! She always does a great job!I have been going to Lush for almost a year now. I was recommended to this place by a friend who has been going here for about a year and I had a great experience. 

I went in for a gel mani/pedi and the lady doing my nails was very friendly and did a good job. I was on a break for a few days and didn't have time to go back to get my nails done. I asked the lady to redo them and she did. She did a great job but I don't like the color and she was"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"To date I have only gone there for brazilian waxings, but I must say, they have been excellent.  Julie does a fabulous job and is really sweet and easy to talk to, which is definitely a good thing during an awkward procedure like a brazilian!  I've been getting brazilians for ten years now and she is one of the best waxers I've found.  She works quickly and in small sections, so the pulls hurt MUCH less than other waxers I've been to.  Also she is very good about asking if the wax temperature is ok for you.  Beatiful job!  

In terms of the front desk service: the first time I went was a little over a year ago, and I would have had to agree with some of the other previous raters: the waxing was excellent however the service at the front desk was not up to par.  I gave them another shot a month ago and then again last week: I'm happy to report they have totally stepped up their front desk service!  Last year, the girls at the front desk were too busy chatting to bother acknowledging me for several minutes and were kind of rude when they did finally get to me.  This has totally changed now; the last two times I came in I was greated by friendly staff right away.  Cheers on stepping up your game!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I visited this nail salon yesterday in hopes to find a new nail salon, my pedicure was extremely rushed I have polish on my skin still, don't even get me started on my refill I asked for them to be cut down a tiny bit she showed me the first ones length I said it was fine thn she continued to cut more off of my length, didn't shape them at all, I asked for a simple French manicure on coffin nails the first person to do my nails literally looked like a toddler did them the white was just straight across no angle or arch, I thn was passed on to another woman to fix them who did at least refixed the shape but she also couldn't do a proper French manicure and left me with points, it has been less thn 24 hours and my nails are all scuffed. I paid $70 which is more than I've ever payed for any refill/pedicure and the work was horribly done I would not recommend them to anyone ever. Mind you the second woman who I'm assuming was the manager told me "" this is a lot of work "" while painting my nails as if it wasn't her job. 

I attached pictures of what I asked for vs the what the first woman did vs the final product you can see none of them are close to what I asked for."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"This is a review for the owner, Crystal, and I will admit that I have been a customer for a long time. I am a very loyal client and have had great experiences with this place. I have been in the area for several years and have been to many nail salons. I have found the service to be very poor. I have had nothing but great experiences at this place. The customer service is great and they do a great job. I have been coming here for years and my nails always look great. I love that they have a parking lot in front of the building and have a parking lot next to it. I can't imagine going anywhere else. I have never had a bad experience here. I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I asked for a little longer but she made it as short as possible. I got a pretty low fade but not too much. I would have liked to go shorter but I didn't want to cut my hair short. The guy cut my hair way too short and it was terrible. He didn't give me a good cut. I will never go back. I have been going to this salon for years."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I never review anything, but this is the absolute worst experience I've had at a place of service (including restaurants etc).  I came in for a full blow out and explicitly stated that I was hoping for it to last 2 days. I was told since I had washed my hair recently I didn't need to get the full blow out and should do the express. 

The stylist (Taylor) was not very friendly and BARELY touched my hair. She curled it once through in about 4-5 minutes flat, and then was done.  My hair was flat on my head so I asked her to tease it, which she did not do. 

Normally I don't complain about these things, so I just left dissatisfied.  I was in the building for 10 minutes total. But then, 1.5 hours later the curls in my hair had completely fallen out (my hair usually holds curl very well).  I called hoping that they could fix it the next morning for me, given that I was extremely dissatisfied and my hair didn't even last two hours. They refused to compensate me and said that ""maybe they would if it wasn't an express service"". 

This place is TERRIBLE and my 12 year old cousin could have done my hair better than this.  DON'T DON'T DON'T waste your money. A youtube tutorial and a $15 curling iron at CVS will leave you much more satisfied."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I would not recommend going here. The woman who did my nails did not speak English and the other woman doing my nails did not speak English. The lady who did my nails did not even ask what I wanted. She cut me 3 times and when I asked for a tip she was rude and did not even apologize. I will never go back here and will never recommend this place to anyone. I will be telling everyone to do not go here. I will never go back here. I've been here twice for a Brazilian wax. Both times, my waxer was great. She talked me through the whole process and made sure I was comfortable. I can't wait to return for another wax. I have been to a few different nail salons in the area and I've had a few bad experiences. I have been very happy with my services. I've been getting my nails done for over a year now and I've never been disappointed. My nails always look great and they are reasonably priced. The salon is very clean and nicely decorated. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I always receive a warm welcome when I come in and welcome."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"This review is for THI. I went in for a consultation for a full set of acrylics and was very happy with the results. The lady who did my nails was very nice and did a great job. However, the acrylics are not very good. I had to file them a bit and they look like they are on the same side of my nails. I also got a fill in with gel polish and the guy that did my nails did a sloppy job. I went back to get them fixed because the nail tech was rude and did not communicate well with me. When he went to paint my nails, he cut my finger with the drill. He did not clean the cuticle until he started to do my nails. When he finished he didn't ask how I wanted my nails to be shaped and the nail tech made no attempt at doing a good job. I was very disappointed. I will not be back. I will say this is the best nail salon I have ever been to in the city. If you are looking for a new nail place to get your nails done, go to this place. I've been going here for about a year and a year now."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"What a joke this place is. The woman who did my nails did not speak English and just wanted to get out of there. She was also very rough with my hands. I will never go back. Update: 
I have been going to this nail salon for years and have never had a bad experience. I have had many different people do my nails and they all do a great job! I highly recommend this place. I love this place! I go to Jessica for my nails and she is the best. I've never been disappointed with my nails! She always does a great job and is so sweet! I've been going to her for over a year now and I highly recommend her to everyone!!I've been going to this salon for a few months now. It's clean, modern, and very welcoming. I've never had a bad experience. I love the decor and the people that work there. I've had good experiences with other salons in the area and this is the only one I'll go to for now.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I usually don't write reviews on the same day as my visits, but I had such a wonderful experience here and i just have to give this spot some PR!

This spot is run by Tony and his wife, plus one or two extra workers if the shop is busy.

Because of our test schedule, my friends and I were only able to do Monday afternoon (which is the day they are closed) BUT I gave Tony a call and he squeezed in our mani/pedis. YASHHH!

Parking: a little tight lot shared with other businesses, there's a small street behind the shop and you might be able to park there too.

Pricing: pretty affordable! I posted a picture of their pricing. We're still students and we definitely needed a spot that fits our budget.

Service: one of the best nails experiences I've had! They were offering us water/ soda/ coffee through out. I speak Vietnamese, so I usually watch out for nails salons who trash talk their customers. Tony and his wife pride themselves to be completely polite and courteous to their customers!
-mani: we all got gel and the coat seems pretty thick and well done.
-pedi: okay the truth is that, today was my first pedi. Toni shaved off 25 years worth of calluses. But hey, my toes look sexier than ever.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot! Call ahead to make sure they save a spot for you! And go ahead, pamper yo'self girls and guys :)"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have been going to Jerry for YEARS and I'm ashamed this is my first review. Jerry is the best! I have been biting my nails basically since birth. Not just nibbling on them... I'm a hardcore, professional nail destroyer (pic included). I get acrylics partially as a protection for my fingers.  

Jerry always works a miracle on me and never gives me a hard time when I come in missing most or all of his beautiful nails. And let's be clear... I'm missing nails for 1 of 2 reasons. I either waited 5+ weeks to go back, or (just as likely) I chewed on the acrylics too. 

Jerry's work is excellent. I have never had a nail lift or separate (that wasn't caused by my own destructive nail biting habit). He uses a clear gel topcoat so polish NEVER flakes or peels. But they also have a crazy huge selection of color acrylic powder, so usually I can pick one of those and skip the polish step completely! Jerry's even been willing (for special occasions) to create a design in the acrylic nail itself with multiple powder colors (see pic). 

One note on the AFTER pic. They look a little stubby because I have to keep them VERY short for my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai. If I were able to have them longer, Jerry would be able to shape them better. This is totally my fault, not his workmanship."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have to start off by saying that apparently things like this only happen to me. That being said. The spa was very nice. The staff was very polite. My friend and I wanted to have a girls day at the spa together. We both had the 90 minute massage. I had Michelle. She was very good. I then sat in the waiting area drinking complimentary tea and coffee until my next service. I sat for 45 minutes and no one even talked to me. I finally decided to go up to the main desk and find out what the holdup was. My manicure and pedicure had been erased from the system! I was devastated! The staff apologized for the mix up but didn't make any effort beyond that to correct the problem. They merely said they might be able to give me a 20% discount for the massage I had already gotten. I sat and waited for yet another hour while my friend finished her treatments. She has been going there for years with no complaint and knows the owner well enough to tell him this was outrageous and ended up getting me my massage for free. Had the staff tried harder to accommodate me once they realized there was a problem I would have given a better review. But as they say, one's true character is revealed only when a problem arises. I think I'll take my business elsewhere next time."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I had to try this place out because the reviews are good. 

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  The salon itself is pretty great.  The pedicure chairs are really comfy.  There are a few things that I would not mind if I'm in a rush to get out of there.  They have a lot of colors to choose from.  They have a lot of polishes to choose from.  I got a gel manicure and it was $30.  I liked the fact that it was not just a polish change but it was a gel manicure.  The polish was not as thick as I wanted it to be.  The girl who did my nails did not do a very good job.  My gel manicure was sloppy and the polish was not even on my cuticles.  She just filed the skin of my nails and put the polish on.  I was so disappointed.  I will not be back.  The guy who did my nails was nice and polite but it was not worth the price.


I would recommend this place to anyone.This is the only place for sure my friends and family."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,My sister offered to buy a gift certificate for Christmas. I chose to make a reservation and the girl who answered the phone said she would call me back the next day. She did not. She was rude and rude. She said she would call me back and see if I would have the money. I did not. I did not want to be rude and I was so upset. I will never go back to this place. I am so disappointed.I have been going here for years and have never had a bad experience. The staff is very professional and it's not just a spa but a relaxing and relaxing environment. The massage therapists are amazing and they do a wonderful job on my full body massage. I usually get my nails done by Mary and she is a perfectionist. I would recommend this spa to anyone.The best nail salon in town! They always do a great job on my nails and the people are always so nice and funny. I always come back here and they always make sure I am happy with my nails.I always get my nails done here and I always get my nails done by Tina. She is the best nail techs.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I'm in town on vacation and with a gel manicure and pedicure. I knew it would be about the time to get a fresh set while here. The timing sped up a bit because the nail on my big toe tore to the quick. After a search, I found this place and with its high reviews. I decided to try to book with ""Holly"" based on a review on this page. When I got there it was busy (Saturday afternoon - totally to be expected and not an issue), and they sat me down at a chair. A person who clearly was not ""Holly"" (male presenting) was going to start work on me until I commented that Holly was scheduled. He called at someone across the room then walked off without any sort of follow up. I waited for a good 10 minutes before the next person walked to me. At that point I was sick of waiting (it had been 20 minutes at that point). When I explained the toe situation, she consulted with someone else who told me I had to get a fake nail. I refused to get a fake nail because wtf? There was zero discussion as to options or next steps. When the consultant walked away from me in a huff, I walked out. 

Normally I wouldn't post a negative review but the abject lack of customer service, conversation or any kind of working together is what spurred this."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Where to start with this amazing Barbershop? Well all of the barbers are super down to earth guys. The atmosphere is very chill. Classic hockey jerseys, classic movies, and skateboards wallpaper every inch of the shop. A huge nod to Reno punk rock culture. Tv's are on and you can hear ESPN going on as you sit and eagerly await your turn. Getting in on some days is like a raffle for the golden ticket except in this case everyone eventually win, its all just a matter of ""time."" You will come to see that Maxwell's lives up to its name and is often crowded. They don't take reservations, and are a cash only business keeping it very old school.  Having gone there many many times and going through so many hair dressers in my life. It is safe to say that I will be going back to them for as long as they decide they want to keep mastering their craft. Pat, Joe, and Nick are quite the comics. Often cracking jokes about their lives, and whatnot you can't help but crack a smile. They take the most pride in what they do and this is by speculation and experience getting my 
Haircuts there. I recommend Maxwell's to anyone lookin for a good cut with old school vibes of a barber you would see somewhere in the east coast. Once again you will not be disappointed, keep up the good work guys."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Worst experience ever. I used to go to the same nail salon all the time, but since the last time I went I've been going to another place that was closer to home. This place is horrible. It's not even close to home. I went in for a gel mani and pedi. They tried to upcharge me by $35 and then I was charged $40. I was charged $55 for a gel mani. The tech didn't even bother to clean up the nails after she finished. The nail tech kept saying they couldn't do a dip manicure because it was ""too long"". I said no because it was too long. She said she could do a dip manicure and was going to charge me $25 for the dip manicure. I will never go back here again. I won't be coming back. I've been coming to this place for a few months now and have never had a bad experience. I always come in for a pedicure and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I usually get gel manicures and it lasts about a week or so long. They do a half the gel pedicure and it lasts about 3 weeks."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I started going to Thrive Hair & Makeup on a recommendation from a friend who's been going to Thrive for the past 9 years.  My hair was long, thick, and straight.  I wanted to be a little more blonde and I wanted to look some natural.  I had a very difficult time finding the right person to do my hair and I was so excited to find Thrive Hair & Makeup.  I'm so glad I did.  I got my hair done by Deana and she did a great job.  She was so sweet and listened to my requests.  I am so happy that I found my new salon.  I would recommend Thrive Hair & Makeup and Deana to anyone.  I would recommend them to anyone!This is my favorite nail salon! I have been going to the same lady for over 10 years. She is amazing! They always have the newest nail polish colors and their gel polish lasts for at least 3 weeks! So happy to have found this place!I recently moved to the area and was looking for a new nail salon. This place was close to my work and was very happy with the reviews so I decided to give it a try"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"It really pains me to write this review (since I really used to love my stylist since I've been a loyal customer for a while) but it must be done.

I've been getting my hair done here for the past 3 years (ever since I've been a redhead) and I used to be totally thrilled with my hair every time I left. I also get the same thing done to my hair every single month (color, roots, and a trim every 3-4 months)

However, in the past few months, I've noticed that my color is not as great as it used to be and I brought it to my stylists' attention. She did offer to fix it when I brought it up, but it still didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. The only thing that disappoints me more than 'eh color' is the excuses she makes every month when I come in and I tell her about the color. ""Oh, it must be the water you shower in"" or ""Oh it never takes the same way twice"" or ""Oh it must be your cycle."" Every month the excuses get more and more crazy and 3 months later (and about 5 tries later), I still don't have the color I want.

Plus I had a shoot on Saturday and one of the photos clearly shows my roots which were done only 2 weeks ago! That was the last straw for me.

I'm sorry, but I think this is goodbye."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Just came from getting a manicure from Nail Bar and truly enjoyed the experience. 

I made the mistake of asking for a manicure which got me the basic manicure while my intentions were to receive the nail bar manicure. I could have caught it early however decided to try out the basic since I'd never had a mani without doing a soak. 

My nail tech was very fast without having me feel rushed.  Took the time to comment on my nails stating the fact that  my I have a very healthy nail bed:) Recommending a product to strengthen my nails however due to their being so thin after years of acrylics. She was also very gentle with the cuticle cutter which is a plus for me. I believe I was serviced by the manager, so she had to stop a few times while doing my mani and apologized each time, and stated she wants to be sure she finishes because she knows I'm on a lunch break. 

As was said, they use salon quality products, very beautiful salon BTW and offer you something to drink while being serviced.

Needless to say enjoyed the experience and it was a great mani to be a dry one let me add. OH my nails polish dried incredibly fast. Even with the use of quick dries in other salons, I've never had them dry so fast which was fabulous being I did still need to eat my lunch."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"Whaaa?  

Bad reviews for this place, as well. I will not be going back. 

I am very disappointed. The girl that did my nails was nice, but she was very rough. She kept cutting my cuticles and pulling them out with the drill. The polish is uneven. I could have done a better job myself. I will not be going back.I've been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon. I'm from out of town and my boyfriend and I have been going to this nail salon for the past 6 months and I've never had a bad experience. The owners are friendly and do a great job on their work. I've never had a bad experience. It's always clean and everyone is very nice and nice. I also love that the pedicure chairs are new and new. I also like how they have a very comfortable massage chairs. I will continue to come here for pedicures as well.I just got a massage from Heather today and it was incredible. I had a massage from her and she really worked on my neck and shoulder and back and shoulders. I left feeling great! I would highly recommend"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Fraud Alert! Always had great customer service and the best prices. My husband and I have been going to this salon for the past 3 years. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. They take their time and make sure you're happy. I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut. I wanted to be a little more blonde, but I'm not sure what she was doing. She was cutting and doing a good job, but it didn't look great. It took her less than 10 minutes and I was out of there in an hour. I didn't like how it turned out. I wish I had been aware of this before I left. I will not be returning. My friend and I went to this nail salon for the first time. We had a really great experience and they were very professional and sweet. They did a great job on my nails. The service was very clean and the pedicure was excellent. I will be back!I went to this salon on my way back."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"i brought my 10 year old into the p&w nail salon for a special treat for getting good grades. before we went there i called to ask what a mani pedi for a 10 year old cost. he told me $32. i said okay and told the guy id be getting a deluxe pedi. i brought Halloween nail art stickers with me. we also brought our own nail polish. both technicians were very good. i went to pay as she was finishing my daughter's hands. they put $42 on the bill for my kid. i told the man it was $32 on the phone, which is what im willing to pay. then he said she did art work and i had to pay for that labor. i told him that was ridiculous, and that not only did i bring the stickers with me...i had up until that point been willing to leave the leftover stickers with the girl. he said he could reduce it to $5. i said again it was ridiculous, at which point another employee (male) who was sitting in the waiting area decided it was funny and started to mock me in english, after i asked him what was ridiculous? he said he was watching a movie. i will NEVER go back to this place. EVER. I didnt tip and i left with my stickers. didn't want then to try to charge another woman $10 for the free stickers i brought from home..."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I think they do very nice work as far as shape of nail and cleanliness of salon and politeness and attitude of staff/owners.  Additionally they were ON TIME for my appointment and these are key elements to me absolutely!  However, I wanted a french (soft) manicure and have a pale pink color.  Due to the time and the fact that they did take me in right on time and there was a gal waiting right behind me.... I probably should have spoke up more or perhaps made myself -more clear than the photos I showed from their website but I was assured he understood what I wanted and - I hate the color. To re iterate- I did show him a picture of what I wanted and was assured he was clear on my choice so I am still a bit confused on why or what happened but before I knew it was done and paying and they are not what I asked for nor are they a 'french manicure'.  Still, a nice shape and thin as I prefer but now I will have to have the gel redone - again -before the weekend as I need to have the french manicure a specific event so....for this reason I am giving 3 stars. It's a good salon but be very specific on what you are looking for and if it appears your not getting it speak up or your out the door!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I went in yesterday and asked for the design on my toes. She did not do a good job. She didn't even apologize for the mess she had made. She was very rough with my cuticles and she did not paint my nails. I would not recommend this place.I'm always a bit nervous about trying new salons, but I have been to a few places in the city and this one was the best I've ever been to. I loved the atmosphere and service. I have never felt rushed or the nail techs were rushing me out. I was able to walk in without an appointment and they had a wide selection of colors and options. The pedicure was very relaxing and my toes look fantastic. I'll definitely be back.I've been going to this location for years now. I have been going to the same stylist for over 20 years. I love the location and the stylists. I've gotten a few good haircuts at this location. My only complaint is that the other stylists are very friendly. My last two visits to this location I had a great experience, I always get a cut and blowout. But I've always get a great job done with the head massage."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I had a sprain from a last minute appointment and decided to book a massage for the first time. I read the reviews and decided to call and get an appointment. I was very pleased with the customer service and the result. I was able to get an appointment within the next day for the same day. I was able to book with a male therapist and he was very professional and knowledgeable. I was very pleased with the results. I am looking forward to getting a facial next week!I've been to this nail salon a couple of times. I'm not sure why I don't give this place more than 5 stars. 

I went in today for a pedicure and a gel manicure. They both took their time and did a great job. I've had a few bad experiences here, but the pedicure was just as great. My nails look great and they're very friendly. I was greeted by my nail tech, Tracy, who was very friendly and welcoming. The pedicure was great too.

I will definitely be back.I used to love this place so much. They do a great job. But after going there. I never go there because it's the other places"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This was my first time at Holiday Nails. I read the reviews but still decided to try out the place because it's in my neighborhood. I'm looking for a nail salon in my neighborhood that does good consistent work. When I first walked in I didn't get greeted. I didn't feel welcomed at all. This isn't the place where your nail tech smiles and has pleasant conversations with you. That is a con for me. A pro for the nail salon is the price and short time it took to do the manicure and pedicure. If my gel nails last at least 2 weeks then I would consider returning. The nail techs that did my pedicure and manicure were too rough. They took off too much cuticle and it was a painful process. Maybe they were rushing? It looks like this salon values quantity over quality. As seen in my pics, my cuticles for some nails tore and began bleeding within a few days of getting the manicure. It was painful. The pedicure wasn't anything special. I didn't like how thin this salon shaves/files down your nails. The pedicure started chipping the next day. 3 days after the pedicure, most of my nails began chipping. I'm going to have to get my toes redone. Overall, not the worst experience I've ever had but I don't see myself becoming a regular there. Btw, they do accept credit/debit cards. I was able to leave the tip on the card."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Unfortunately this will be our last stay at the Peppermill. When we checked in, we were told there would be a $35 per night "" housekeeping fee"". We originally planned to stay for two nights but due to unforeseen circumstances, we have to leave a day early. I went to the front desk and asked the girl if we would have to pay the housekeeping fee for the second day since we had to leave early. She went to ask her Supervisor and told me I would still be charged the whole $79. Wait, I thought it was a "" per night"" fee? So.... basically I just paid $79 plus $50 for one night, that does not sound like a good deal to me. You would think that with all the money the Peppermill makes, waiving the $35 housekeeping fee for one night when I'm giving them back the room to book to someone else would not be such a big deal. Great customer service Peppermill. I think from now on I will stick to the Silver Legacy!

Fast forward to this morning, I checked out at 10:45 am, expressed my dislike of the policy to the guy checking me out. He was very rude and arrogant and acted like he just wanted me to leave. No, sorry you feel this way etc...just yeah we'll have a nice day...next customer? I DEFINITELY will not be returning to this establishment. Word to the management, refresher course on customer service."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I yelped a place to go to and found this place. I was a walk in and was immediately greeted by the front desk staff. The place was clean and the staff was nice.

I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be returning for my next manicure!  I'm going to try a gel manicure next time I'm in town. I've found my new go-to place!I've been going here for about a year now and I have never had a bad experience. It's always clean, professional and affordable.

I was nervous because I'm from out of state, but I was so pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure what she was talking about but she was really good. She really took the time to make sure my wax was perfect and I left feeling like I was in a good place. She also gave me a great back massage.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Before coming to Mirror & Mantel, I was very nervous! I had just moved to Philadelphia and had been going to my previous salon for 12 years. However, I knew I had to find someplace local. I was referred by a friend and booked an appointment with LB. With great credentials (all stylists have a profile on their website) I knew she was more than qualified. Once I sat down with her I felt immediately at ease. She effortlessly did my cut and color and even convinced me to get some long layers I was apprehensive about. It looked amazing! 

In addition to having an incredible experience with LB, the salon itself has such a cool feel. Its pretty minimalist with the decor but in a way that you know they're prioritizing their business to provide the best products. They use all organic and high end products but lines that you don't typically see. This place has mastered looking effortlessly cool while having very high end tools and products. 

This place goes above and beyond to make their clients feel at home. My personal favorite is the jars of cookies/snacks around the salon as well as the Birch Box give and take where you can drop in anything you don't want from your Birch Box and chose something else- amazing idea! 

Walked into Mirror & Mantel full of nerves and walked out feeling like I had found my new forever place with my next appointment on the books!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was a frequent customer from May thru September receiving both pedicures and gel manicures. Honestly my experience while there was amazing. At that time I would've recommended this place to the world.

After my last visit I went back to doing my own pedicures which I had always done prior to going to Tints. Honestly only had two pedicures in my life prior. Anyways, I noticed three of my toenails looked funny but just thought that they would grow out and I would be able to cut the ugly off eventually. Only problem is they got worse and which I then realized it was fungus. Yuck. I didn't get mad because things do happen and notified Tints of the issue. What put a bad taste in my mouth and why I'm writing this review, is that they didn't even apologize. I wasn't expecting anything monetary, just wanted them to acknowledge that it happened and at the bare minimum, to say that they were sorry and doing what they could to prevent something like this from happening to another customer. 

Toenail fungus I have learned is not an easy thing to get rid of.  It takes months of daily treatment. So every day as I've been treating my toenails I've been getting more bitter about their lack of response. I don't know how it happened exactly, but the pain of having to go through this months long process will never have me stepping into a nail salon again."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Truly terrible service. The woman who did my nails, Tiffany I believe, was unbelievably rude. I made a simple complaint about the shape of my nails and she was immediately defensive and very rough with my hands for the rest of the service. I chose a color that I did not realize was one that she used two different polishes for, which is not very common, so I asked to see the two colors that I chose, and she asked ""why"". I am a paying customer, and if I ask to see a color you should never ask why, you should say of course.

I would also like to point out that I am a young black woman, and the majority of her patrons are white. Unfortunately, I am therefore not extremely surprised that I was treated with disrespect and her white clients that entered were treated with kindness. 

I really should not have bothered to tip, as this is one of the ugliest manicures I have received in a very long time, but I understand that she lives off tips. 

Also the set up in there is quite odd, your nails are done on a large pillow in a low seat - very uncomfortable.

I will not be returning to this poor excuse of an upscale salon, and would not recommend to others either. Not too sure how this salon has so many 5 Star reviews. If you want your nails done properly, don't waste your money and go elsewhere."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"All I can say is NOPE. I've been going here for 6 years because there is nothing else affordable in Nashville when it comes to spray tans. There is always a line, and the spray tans are terrible. Let me explain what happened to me tonight ...

I have a really important event tomorrow and on Sunday where I'll be photographed a lot, and went in for my usual spray. I have been doing this for SIX YEARS. I know the drill, exfoliate, prime, all that. I got in one of their new booths and the spray started and sprayed me like a shower. It shot out super fast and it looked like I went mudding. I quickly got out and wiped it off. I went to tell the girls and they just replied with ""oh must be the nozzle"" and I said I was going home to wash it off before it sets. They replied with ""well we close in 30 minutes so....."". I was so angry I left before I lost it on them. No one said sorry, no one tried to fix the problem, the way they reacted was so unprofessional. One of the girls rolled their eyes and was bothered at the fact that she had to go look at it. I left. I am so disappointed and will be cancelling my membership first thing in the morning, because they made it very clear they were CLOSING IN 30 MINUTES, so I won't bother them tonight."

I usually go to my regular nail salon but I had some bad experiences at this place. I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. My nail technician was very nice but she rushed through my pedicure. The polish was not on evenly and not evenly. She did not even file the bottom of my nails. She was filing my nails and scrubbing the bottom of my nails.

It wasn't fantastic but good enough that I would return later (today) return for a nail fill. HAD A FIT!!! I should have know something was off when this foolish woman placed a cotton ball of acetone on my nails and then wrapped them on aluminum foil. I thought ""maybe this is just a new way to soften powder"" then.....I felt my nails melting off. I was in shock when she pulled the aluminum foil off and asked ""so.....do you want the tip or just your natural nail?"" WHAT?!?! I CAME IN FOR A FILL!! NOT A NEW SET! I didn't say all of this because I didn't want to embarrass anyone else so I waited till the room was a bit more empty and then I asked ""When you get a powder fill, so you always replace the whole nail??"" She replied ""Yes. Always."" I ALMOST lost my Christianity but found Jesus and left once I paid ANOTHER $110 for a full set and pedicure! I'm not one to negotiate business transactions as I own my own business, I paid because a service was performed. I will NEVER AGAIN go back. She made me pay for her inability to pay attention to what was said. She charged me because she wanted to save face. It's disgusting business etiquette."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"The only reason why I am placing two stars is because of the technician staff.

Initially visited the Spa thru a groupon I purchased.
My first appointment was with Christine, very knowledgeable, professional and friendly. Explained everything about the treatment and even tried to get me to purchase more appointments and products that day. (exactly what a business owner should want in an employee) at the end of the appointment i scheduled my remaining 2 appt with her. Following week received a phone saying she was unavailable an rescheduled me with Bonnie (friendly, professional). When arriving for that appointment there was some confusion in the book about what time I was suppose to be there. Red Flag 1. Third appointment with Sandra(very friendly, professional) where I purchased and paid for additional 3 treatments. Scheduled the next three that day. 4th appointment no reminder phone call apparently the owner fired the front desk staff . Red Flag 2
Final visit scheduled for a Tuesday (closed Mondays) called after 9 to reschedule where I was informed if it was a voucher/Groupon appointment I would forfeit my appointment. Which I informed the person on the phone that it was not I purchased directly thru them. She then told me about a cancellation and rescheduling fee. I was really surprised I had not been informed of any policy like this thru email, brochures or verbally. Very disappointed really felt the treatment were working. Seriously recommend if you are looking for Cavi Treatments look for a different Spa."

My nails look very good, but the second time I went I was charged $60 for a refill. The nail tech that did my nails was very rough and made me bleed. She was very rough and made me bleed and seemed to the entire time. My manicure lasted 2 days. The lady was very rough and very rude. I was bleeding. I will never come back"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Three things you should know about me: 1. I've spent my entire life under the impression that my hair is inherently greasy (and frizzy and untamable and evil and unmanageable.....), 2. I had super short hair for about 10 years and only started to grow it out two years ago, 3. The last woman who cut my hair was my mother. It's been men ever since.

Katie at Rinse changed everything! I showed up at 10am last Tuesday morning (life of a grad student...) and was welcomed into a small cheery salon. I drank tea and listened to light background music while Katie cut my hair. She then taught me the appropriate way to blow dry my hair (10 years of super short hair remember) and proceeded to finish with a dry cut (much better since my hair is absurd and I may have a few cowlicks). All the while she was chatty (but not fake) and was extraordinarily helpful in explaining to me that my hair isn't greasy and that by washing my hair too frequently I was actually making it frizzier. 

So what did I learn? 1. My hair doesn't have to be greasy (or frizzy or untamable or evil and unmanageable.....) with the right care, 2. Long hair can can be awesome and sexy, 3. Women will once again be cutting my hair - just not my mother! 

I know $65 isn't cheap for a cut but I'll definitely be returning for future cuts and life/hair lessons from Katie!"

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Came in for a pedicure and SNS refill on a referral from a friend...big mistake. The consistency of this place is horrible. My friend's mani/pedi looked great, but I couldn't run fast enough. 

The check in system is cool, you sign in on an iPad and they will text you when it's your turn. I don't think I waited more than 20 minutes. 

My pedicure was awful. The tech barely did any of the normal pedicure features like a scrub and puma stone. The polishing was crappy, I had to ask him to fix multiple toes as they had either bubbled or were see through. He left polish on my skin, so I had to ask him to clean it up. Finally, someone else came over to finish, but acted like I was in the wrong for wanting a decent service for my money. 

I told them up front I needed a SNS refill, yet they waited until half way through my pedicure to wrap my nails. So I had to wait a bit between the pedicure and when my soak off was complete. Annoying, but not the worse thing in the world. What was bad was that the new tech barely shaped my nails (they weren't even), my cuticles were messy and she had no problems trying to move on. I told her thanks, but no thanks. I'll just pay you for the manicure, don't bother with the SNS. 

Will not be back and I don't recommend it to anyone else."

The lady who was there told she has to talk to the manager and she will call me back which they didn't do I went there again on Wednesday again and she said she didn't get chance to talk to the manager which was so disrespectful and on Friday morning she finally called but she called my sister instead of me and said I can change my plan and when I got there they charged me 1067 and when I asked why a lady who was there said it's a penalty for changing my plan which I even didn't start with them and if I want to cancel I have to pay 100 something $ so I decide to stay with the 2 years plan.

He will have 15 people waiting for a haircut and for some reason he'll be the only one cutting hair, and that is the tip of the iceberg.  He won't act as if there are 15 people waiting....he'll talk and show pictures of him and celebrities to everyone while trying to brag about how much of a big shot he is...just shut up and cut hair...and NO! I DO NOT WANT YOUR STUPID STICKER ON MY CAR!! God forbid you use a GTE debit card as payment...Tim will flip out as if you poured a drink over his head.   I feel bad for his employees, because they do try and do good work...but the owner just craps all over any good reputation his employees brings his shop. I've seen him treat customers like a petulant child. I once pointed out he had an Apple Pay logo on his credit card machine and asked if I could pay with Apple Pay (Because he doesn't accept the dreaded GTE debt card) ...I pointed at the Apple Pay logo on the credit card machine and he reprimanded me by shouting ""Don't touch that!"".  This guy is a joke...look up his background as well...I hope his business fails...maybe if that happens he'll become a better person.  If he wanted his shop to succeed he should hire responsible people and count money and stay the hell away from the building."

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I looked into Sonobello services over a year ago and decided that these services would benefit me.   I had no trouble with  my appointments.  All of the staff, from the front desk, sales rep, nurses and doctor) are very nice and professional.  My sales rep, Yahaira, explained what to expect during the procedure.  During my pre-op visit, the nurse explained all of the medications and Dr. Bose explained what to expect.  The day of the surgery, Dr. Bose explained again what was going to be done even noticing that more skin had to be removed from one side so that my stomach would be evened out.  He answered all of my husband's questions the day of the operation.  I was surprised that I felt more pain during the procedure than expected, however Dr. Bose kept saying everything was going well which gave me the much needed encouragement.  I also got to see all of the fat and skin that was removed which was further encouragement that I made the best decision for me.  Everyone is different, however for me the pain level the next day was a 12 on a scale of 1-10.  Sitting and laying down became a real challenge.  The pain medications worked and I was feeling better within a couple of days.  I'm still swollen and healing but I'm already happy with what I see so far. Now it's up to me too lose the rest."

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Mandy and Cheryl did my hair and makeup for my wedding and they did an amazing job! They came to the hotel to do everything.  All my bridesmaids got their hair done and each had different styles.  Mandy just looked at the pictures and did the hair exactly like the girls wanted.  She was very fast and efficient.  She had no problem making changes if they wanted a simple fix.  It looked really great with all the different styles she could do.  I am still getting compliments everyday about my hair that she styled.  She really listened to what I wanted.  It turned out beautiful and looks amazing in all the pictures.  She even gave a tutorial to all my bridesmaids on how to take out the veil.  Cheryl was originally only supposed to do makeup for 5 girls but when everyone saw what a wonderful job she did they all wanted their makeup done.  Instead of doing 5 girls, she did 9! She made the makeup look very natural but stunning.  One of the bridesmaids got fake eyelashes so I decided to do it as well.  They made the eyes look great and stayed on perfect the whole night.  All the girls were really happy with the results! I would highly recommend these 2 for any wedding.  Not only did they do a fabulous job, but they are such great people.  They were very friendly and professional."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I've been going to this salon for a year or so now.  I do not go frequently but I go around 5 times a year which is enough to notice that the service has gone downhill. I love the way they do my nails and they always end up looking very nice. 4/5 times my nails will look just the way I wanted but sometimes I feel as if the nail tech. doesn't listen to what I ask for and completely misses the mark on my nails.

Also, the employees are very kind but sometimes I spend up to 15 minutes sitting in a chair (with an appointment) without anyone ever saying a word to me. The place is also quite pricey for what they do.

Overall it's a great place but it's a bit risky if you're in a time crunch or if you're trying to save money. 

Update: I'm not normally one to give a poor review but this place really disappointed me. I went in for gel and my nail tech filed my nails so thin that they burned in the led light; it was pretty painful. He told me that it was just a little hot and to deal with it. A lot of the nails lifted within a week and were popping off after two weeks. The gel on my thumb came off less than a day after the manicure. This experience was really frustrating and I don't think I'll be coming back, especially considering the prices are so high."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Stevie is truly amazing at what he does and is such a sweet person!! I'm so happy he was able to fit me into his schedule because he made my hair look the best it's ever looked. I have very long hair and I like layers but no one was ever able to give me the blended layers I wanted so my hair looked weighed down. My haircuts were always too blunt and chunky in the past. Stevie knew exactly what I meant and fixed it for me so effortlessly. I feel like I've been asking for this exact haircut for years but just never got it. Meanwhile, I barely have to explain to him and he already knows what I mean.

Today, I felt amazing and kept looking at my hair in the mirror. And my fiancé complimented me all day! Stevie did a dark brown balayage and it turned out sooo pretty. He asks questions to really know what you want and makes it turn out better than you hope for. He's also super nice and easy to talk to so I felt completely comfortable and had a fun time talking to him while he did my hair. He was informative and explained everything he was going to do which was awesome because I never got my hair dyed professionally before. I love his work so much and am so glad I was able to find someone like him. He's the best!!! Wish I found him sooner, but better late than never! :D"

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"So excited to have been the first client to check out the new Lather Up experience! Being a hairstylist at Lather Hair Studio, I think it's awesome and so convenient that I can take care of my skin as well as my hair in one place. Hannah, the esthetician, took the time to consult me on my skin care routine, then recommended the best products and services to suit my skin. At first she recommended microdermabrasion to clear up some old scars I have. However, after picking up that I had plans after our appointment we wound up going with a gentler lactic acid treatment instead. I was glad I left with an amazing glow and super clear pores instead of mild discomfort from the microdermabrasion (although I will try it at our next appointment). Back to the facial: amazing ambience which was both relaxing and energizing, thorough extractions and super effective treatments. In addition to the lactic acid peel, I tried the high frequency, which kills bacteria and eliminates acne. I also tried the nuface treatment (a super pleasant roller ball thing that apparently 'works out' your face). At the end of our appointment I randomly asked for some waxing services and she didn't miss a beat. She was super quick, less irritating and no random wax residuals left on me. Hannah is a great addition to the Lather team! She is passionate about her craft and super professional, It's great to have someone I can trust for all of my skin care needs."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Usually go to Lotus but they did not have an opening when I wanted to go. I came here as it's just down the road. I got a pedicure which was great. Then a different lady came out to do my gel manicure. I almost feel like she either did not care about what she was doing or has never done a gel manicure at all. She did not cut my cuticles and seriously filed my nails in under 5 seconds, basically just barely ran the file along the nail once and moved on. All the while she was looking around not watching what she was doing. For instance once she filed my skin because she was too busy looking around to notice what she was filing. She then started painting with the gel polish and continued to file and clip while painting. Gel is finicky and can't have dust or particles flying around while painting or it will get stuck in the polish so I thought this was just absurd. She also put so much polish on that it would pool in my cuticles when curing and in some areas the nail polish had a bump. So each time she would need to clip the pooled polish out of the cracks in my nails. I asked her to file down the bump on several of my nails and she could not understand what I was asking. Unfortunately the manicure ended up being terrible enough to overshadow the fine pedicure. I will not be returning."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Just to start off this review, I am very disappointed in this place. First off, the front desk staff was very nice. The office is very clean and the front desk staff was very helpful. Second, the nurses were very nice. They told me I could come back in for a second appointment. I was a bit disappointed because I had to wait 30 minutes for an appointment. They didn't seem to care about me as I was on my way. It's very unprofessional to have to wait so long. I would have rather waited 30 minutes for an appointment. I was very upset with this and would not go back.

I was not impressed with the nurse practitioner I had. She seemed annoyed to me by my comments and not to mention didn't ask how I wanted my nails done. She did not ask how I wanted my nails to be. I was told I wanted a french tip with the tips. She didn't say anything. She did not ask me if I wanted a French tip and I said I did not. She didn't ask me to pay. I should have asked for a French tip and the tip and was very upset and I was so mad. I will not be paying more then. When I went back to the bill again."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"If you are looking for a professional, clean haircut this is not the place you want.  I've had two trips, two different stylists.  The first wasn't great, but wasn't terrible - hence the return visit (and 2 stars).  After my latest cut, however, I will never go back. 

I called and specifically asked for someone that was good with short hair, and Jen was recommended.  At first I thought I was in good hands.  She picked up on the slight cowlick and wave, and stated that she planned to 'frame my face' with some length in the front while shortening up the back and thinning out the rest.  Sounded good.  

Well now I have a haircut that I have only ever seen on a 40-yr old lesbian from Iowa.   It is far too short, with the 'long' front pieces falling on my cheekbone (that awkward 'I'm growing it out' length).  One side is longer than the other by a good inch, and the back comes so high up my neck that she may as well have used clippers... only if she had it might have ended up straight across the back.  Instead the back forms a curious point far left of center.  I can forgive misunderstanding, but the haircut is clumsy and messy without even being edgy.  

Summary:  Cuts here are mediocre at best.  Some stylists are better than others, but nearly all went to the same schools and it shows."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"Beware! This company is a rip off run by a total fraud! I signed up for a membership and was immediately double charged. After several attempts to contact the owner, an employee had to finally take care of the problem for me. Then, after a short while discovered through another employee, that he was closing his locations without any notice to the customers...therefore continuing to collect their membership monthly fees without the customer receiving any services....And fully admitted to this employee thats what he was doing! The only way to cancel is by retrieving paperwork from the location and then mailing it in to the company! Hard to do this if they are closed! Aftering getting a heads up on what was about to occur, I cancelled my membership per his ridiculous manner. As predicted the location was closed shortly after, leaving all these customers out of money and out of tans! I then found out after a month or so of no charges that he put my card through again and took money out of my bank account again! He is unreachable after leaving several messages...the only remedy is to change your debit card. If the owner ever reads this, (which I highly doubt he will), I'd love to know why you're still taking money from me and others after canceling my account, and why you're too much of a coward to return my calls ....or my money...there are many other great tanning places out there...go to them and stay away from this con artist!"

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"This company will do anything to take your money be very aware that their contract is geared to scam you! The day of the COVID shut down, I called to request my account be cancelled. They offered to freeze it for me indefinitely instead and told me that I would be contacted when it was going to be unfrozen. They claim to have sent out an email in May of 2020 saying that my account would be unfrozen but I never received it. I have every email from Them since 2019 EXCEPT for that email they claimed to have sent out. They have since been charging me monthly without ever notifying me. They charged me over $600 (it's a credit card I never use so I had no clue I was being charged). When I called to ask for a refund the VP of operations told me basically it was my problem that I didn't receive the email. Per their contract they can charge you without you ever responding to an email but they can't cancel your membership UNLESS YOU RESPOND TO THE EMAIL. So they can claim to have sent you emails all day long and never have actually sent them. This is a bonified SCAM and they have no interest in acting in good faith or appear to value their customers. Also just FYI this company received over $700,000 in PPE money from the federal government for assistance during the pandemic but claim they don't have the man power to call customers regarding unapproved charges."

After Merril cut my hair for the first time, taking me from below the shoulder length to almost chin length, I knew I would never stray.

Best things about Trim:

Great atmosphere.. I've even been over to the boy's side once for a little neck trim, so I can speak with authority.

Great products.. yes, they're expensive.  But Trim has a fantastic return policy if you end up with something that doesn't work for you.  (Try the Davines shine paste stuff in the pink tin.  It smells like cake and it makes your hair look shiny and new.)

Great stylists.. I cycled through a couple and they all did a decent job.

Great price ranges.. When I started with Merril, she was only $35 for a cut.  Granted, those days are long gone for her, but they always seem to have a reasonable selection of ""junior"" stylists who all wield a mean pair of scissors.

Merril.  Seriously, people.  She rocks.  If you're a gal with short-ish hair, it doesn't get any better than a Merril cut."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I hate to write this review, but the girl who did my nails did a terrible job. I went in for a fill and a pedicure, and the lady who did my nails did a terrible job. She cut me 3 times and when I asked for a refund she said it was a mistake. I was going to get a full set and a pedicure, but she didn't put the nail polish on the actual nail. It was all uneven, and she didn't even bother to clean it up, so she kept going back and forth with me. I was very upset with this and will never go back there again.I've been going here for about a year now and I have never had a bad experience. It's always clean, professional and affordable.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"There's a temp check station at the entrance and they take your pic as well as your temperature. There were hand sanitizer dispensers ever few feet and that was actually nice. Sometimes if you touch doorknobs or buttons for elevators you feel like you've touched at least 600 other people. Elevators were slow and taking one with a bunch of people in it during the ""new ridiculousness"" that is social distancing has become impossible. 
No microwaves or mini-fridge in the room. We put up with that. The shower smelled like mildew and you could see bits of mildew in the grout like someone had lightly cleaned the shower. Pulled back the sheets on the bed and my wife noticed a brown streak with little chunks- yes someone had put dirty sheets on our bed or hadn't changed them either way it was gross.
Cafe Alfresco was ok. Decent technical Italian food. 
Manhattan Deli was especially bad. The food was cold and under-cooked and the server didn't get any of the order right. Soda's were flat and the ice made them taste like really funky tap water. Which made us the pain in the ass diners for the night as my oldest wanted a hot dog but had to settle for a bowl of soupy macaroni and cheese as the cook staff had put everything away for the night and couldn't fry a hot dog.
One thing led to another and we got comped for the bad food. 
This hotel is 4 stars but I guess that really doesn't mean anything."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I visited the Nail Bar on a Saturday around 3:30 with my to be mother in law. I had received a gift certificate for a mani/pedi and they allowed me to use the amount to pay for both of our manicures. 

The wait was 10 minutes which left us time to pick out a polish and a scent for the lotion. The scents were not particularly strong which we appreciated. I chose the lavender and she chose the white tea. It took my mother in law a little longer than 10 minutes to pick out a polish and when they were ready for us they were rather pushy with her to choose. I get why they wanted her to hurry but it was still kind of lame. 

The manicure was speedy quick! It was over before I knew it. My manicurist wasn't the best conversationalist. She spent a majority of her breath promoting everything they do for bridal nails because I just got engaged. It was good information and I kind of appreciated that she told me but that's all she said which ultimately just made me feel like she was trying to sell me something.  

Overall, I would say that my experience was positive. I don't get my nails done very often so when I do, I want to go somewhere nice. Nail Bar was really nice. The atmosphere was trendy and fun. The manicure was quality. I got my nails done two days ago and they still look pretty good. I would definitely come back."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I moved to Nashville from the DC area in January. I was looking to finally get one of my tattoos either covered up or fixed - I'd had it for nearly 3 years and was extremely embarrassed by it. I was constantly explaining it to everyone before they saw it so I wouldn't be ""judged"".

I began looking for artists in the area, and a friend of mine down here recommended Steve Martin from Black 13. He has a good amount of work done by the guy, and I was impressed by what I saw. I finally met up with Steve in May, and we went over the piece - he encouraged me to add different elements to my tattoo versus cover it up - it would be bigger, and the black that I currently have in the piece would be difficult to mask with another design.

We finally had our appointment yesterday (and yes, I was filled with much trepidation), but after only a couple of hours, it was done - and now looks so much better than I could ever have imagined. Steve, thank you for fixing up what I thought would always haunt me. It is amazing that simple changes could invoke such a powerful end-product. I can't wait for it to heal and show it off (and I also can't wait to come back for my next piece!).

May I also add, the rest of the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I feel very at ease in the environment - y'all are a great group of people!"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This place is new and has huge potential but there are a few things that are totally odd and throw me off every time I visit. The vast area of equipment is awesome and there is little wait at all on equipment use. The weight area and training areas are all great. Staff is always nice and wiping stuff down all the time. 

Here's the stuff that bugs me. The cinema room is a great idea and is awesome to kill time and cycle...but what is up with the smell in there? Every time I come it smells bad in there. No ventilation and no air fresheners make for a stanky experience. I understand there's 20 bodies in there but you got to get some air flowing inside. Next is the new equipment wipe down stations, they suck. The paper always falls down and has to be fixed and the rags are very small with too much liquid that leaves wet white streaks on the equipment. Lastly the hydro message area, it is hard to relax with a person 6 inches away talking on the phone and weezing from their workout. Also, letting the people do their own bed wipe downs is GROSS. You know half these people don't wipe down their equipment and the same goes with the beds...you need to have an employee wipe down and inspect each bed before putting another body in it. You are setting yourself up for bed bugs or staff infection issues. 

Will continue to return, love the pool and sauna area."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I went this past Saturday and had the worst experience. I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and the lady at the front desk was not happy with my nails. She was rude and rushed. She rushed through the whole process. I had to ask her to file and shape my nails because I wanted them to be longer. When she was done she had already made me pay for the nail polish. I am not sure if I will be back. I will not be going back.Best salon I've been to in Tampa!

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"With there being so many nail salons to choose from it's difficult, at times, to decide where to go. Especially if you move into a new area or have a horrible experience at one and need to switch asap! Aquastone Nails & Spa on Belcher and 60 is excellent! It is so clean (which we all know is extremely crucial), smells lovely (no nasty chemical smells), and their customer service has, by far, exceeded my expectations in every way! Dyna is my nail tech and she is the sweetest! I get gel polish on my nails and regular on my toes and I like them to match. She will take the time, no matter what, to find a matching polish that I'm happy with. She always takes her time and ensures you are 100% satisfied. 

Most recently, though, the two wonderful attendants at the front (I cannot remember their names) literally spent the time finding a polish for my toes (as this particular gel polish was very difficult to find a regular matching polish for) until they found one by mixing two together! They took the time, which they didn't have to, and it was absolutely appreciated!  To some, this sounds crazy, but to most that love taking the time to match, this type of customer service is far superior than you would ever expect to receive!

I highly recommend this nail salon and it's absolutely worth the drive even if you're not close. I can assure you that after one visit, you won't ever want to go anywhere else!!"

The staff was very quick to come up with a solution and we were very thankful for the willingness to help us out.  We have a Mountain View in the Tuscany Tower and it's beautiful beyond words.  The room is very spacious and luxurious.  The bathroom is absolutely heavenly.  The shower is fantastic and the jacuzzi tub is such a treat after a day of skiing.  Very short drive to Tahoe skiing which is wonderful!!!  (Make sure you rent a car with 4 when drive!). The food here is fantastic- 3 teen age boys that are always eating!  Lots of variety!!  I truly could not be happier with our choice in staying at the Peppermill.  I have to say- whoever came up with the 'extra door' shared between two rooms was a genius!!!!  We close that door at night and you can not hear a thing going on in the hallway.  I'm usually a light sleeper in hotels due to all of the hallway chatter, but NOT HERE!!!  Peaceful and quiet every night.  Again- couldn't be happier with the Peppermill Hotel!!!  Thanks for a wonderful Christmas week- we are so happy to have a few more days to enjoy!!"

They had no color selections. I would not recommend.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was disappointed to see that I had to wait 30 minutes for my appointment. I was just turned away when I arrived. I asked for a cut and a color and got a haircut. I wanted to be a little more blonde, but I'm not sure what she was talking about. She was really nice and seemed really friendly. However, when I asked for a trim, she cut too deep and now I have to go back for another cut. My cut and color looks okay. My highlights are a little choppy, but the highlights are still nice. I'm not sure what she was talking about or what but I didn't get a good haircut. I'm going to try another stylist next time.I've been coming here for about 4 years. I've been going to Amy and her for pedicures, I've had them both done both. They are amazing!

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This is the worst tattoo parlor in New Orleans. If I could give lower than one star I would. Do not get anything done here. The service is horrendous and obviously they try to take advantage of tourists, charging more than the minimum of what it would normally cost for a simple ""4 minute tattoo."" The rude girl who dealt with us, told us that their minimum was 60, but was trying to charge us 80 for three tiny black lines on my mom's forearm. We were insulted by the weird up charge and the rude girl just walked away as we were trying to figure it out, instead of trying to work with us. If you want to be treated fairly, go to Downtown Tattoo.

And to respond to Ed D, we changed our minds about the white tattoo and wanted a regular black tattoo. When we came in the first time there was a very nice guy that we were dealing with who talked us out of the white. When we came back in we dealt with the rude girl who tried to get an extra 20 bucks out of us, instead of actually charging the minimum. We would've happily paid 60, so it's not us that had the issue, it was the girl with the green/blue hair (don't know her name, but obviously we're not the only ones who've had issues with this person) that was trying to weasel us out of money. Other than the bad experience at your parlor, we had a fabulous time in New Orleans."

The actual girl who was waxing me, took me to the back and I could tell she was already a tad bit upset from the client before me. I was patient and polite. She was very neutral and cold. That's fine lol. not everyone is gonna have a good day. What got to me is that i am paying for an underarm wax and she was in a haste to get me out and I COULD TELL. She did horrible on my wax and was not gentle, and after there was still a LOT of hairs left. And the next day, I woke with ingrown bumbs on my underarms which never happened to me in my time of waxing my underarms. She didn't go over it with a tweezer, nothing. Afterwards she was like okay done YIU can get dressed now. And nothing else. I'm not
on to say anything so I didn't but my pits were in pain for a couple of days and STILL hair and I hated the whole experience. Won't be going back. And I usually liked their work.

I asked her to just put a nail top coat over it and she did it all over again.  She then proceeded to talk to me in the language I was speaking, which I was not going to hear her talking to me.  She seemed annoyed at me, but I kept my head to relax and let her know that she was doing a bad job.  She kept telling me to let her know and she was going to cut my nails.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This barber shop is the real deal. There are so many reasons why I feel this shop is the best in town. 
First of all, they are artist that can work on all hair types. Keeping it real, on any given visit you may see a little Asian kid, an old balding white man, a black teenager, or a Latino woman all together getting their hair cut. It's like a beautiful barber rainbow. My children are half Chinese and black and their hair can be somewhat complicated. Every barber there cut their hair masterfully. Also they work magic on my baby who actually walks out with a fade and razor cut hair line. How they do it, I have no idea.
Also, they are very professional. You walk in and there is no talking. Just barbers working hard, devoting their time to their clients. There is no profanity or food allowed inside so it's super clean. They have multiple TV's rocking sports center, the latest games, or my personal favorite, awesome regaton, or hip hop music- all clean. 
We've experienced almost all of the barbers, each one has done excellent work. 
They charge $10 for kids and take the same amount of time on them they would on an adult. They make my boys look great.
They are very popular in our little town, word on the street is all positive. My son's little friends all get their hair cut there and they are all different ethnicities. I love it. 
If your looking for a good barber I highly suggest them- a local Lansdale gem."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I was really looking forward to my massage, as I had not had one in quite some time. Sadly, it got off to a poor start and never quite recovered. I arrived 30 minutes prior to my appointment, as recommended. However, I sat in the waiting room, watching other clients come and go, as if I was lost in space and time. I had to go back to my locker to check my phone, and noticed that my appointment was running late without acknowledgement. 

I had to go back to the front desk to bring it to their attention. My session did not start until 20 minutes after my scheduled time. Part of me wonders how much longer I would've waited if I had not brought it to their attention. I would not have minded running late if someone had cared enough to communicate this to me. That's simply customer service. 

My masseuse did not acknowledge this, and when I brought it up, I was met with little accountability and sincerity, much less an apology. The session itself was in my opinion, average. I have had better relief, even from massages in third world countries. I left feeling with nearly as much tension as when I came in. First impressions are important when you are spending hundreds of dollars and having the value of your time disregarded. I  was looking for a nice spa to commit to, but I cannot say that I will be back. There are too many other spas that can get it right the first time, and every time."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Critical: Quality

My daughter and I have spent over $1000
innthis salon just in the past few months. I had my eyelashes done here and it was
certainly not worth the $100 they charge. the last three times we were here, we get
mad/pedis with gel. Not only did they do
about 6 coats of gel because the girl
messed up one with the lamp, but my
nails have ridges in them and to me that
is because the gel isn't being put on
correctly. I also got a Halloween design
which was subpar and not even or facing
the right direction. Neither my toes or
fingernails are even with eachother and I
have a bit of an ingrown nail which
normally is cut by other salons. We have
both been burned multiple times by the
rocks and towels for the extra pedi. We
did give them several chances to resolve
but with gel that takes time and I feel
three chances should be enough. My
daughter simply asked for a refund for my
nails because I had to go elsewhere to fix
them and not only did the owner refuse,
but the lady was very very rude. My
daughter spent $84 and tipped $20 and
merely wanted the cost of mine back. If
you are looking for consistency, don't
come here. Also I noticed that when my daughter and I got the deluxe pedi they didn't use all of the products on us but kept them for the next person. Who does that. Why not split them between my daughter and I and give us a little break on the cost. My last bill was $241 before the tip for my daughter's pedi with extensions and mani/pedi with gel for me. Thats seems way high."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I was looking for a hair salon that was moderately priced and had great reviews. I looked on google and this salon had pretty good reviews so I thought why not. I was a walk in and the receptionist, who was very nice, said the only stylist that was there was busy but she had someone to call in. The girl arrived very quick. I thanked her for coming in and we got to talking about what I wanted. My hair at the time was past my lower back. I said I wanted it cut to about 2 inches longer then shoulder length. I showed her some pictures of what I liked too. She shampooed my hair and mentioned that when someone with long hair wants a shorter cut, to put it in a pony tail, cut it to a more manageable length and ""style"" form there. I mentioned to her that I read reviews on Google and this was recommended, that I've had stylists before ruin my hair and I'm hoping to find a stylist I can stick with. When she got done ""styling"" my hair.... The length was at my ear lobes! I said, ""Oh that looks a little different then the pictures,"" There was really no point in complaining because nothing can be done for hair being cut too short. I'm not sure where the miscommunication was but I ended up with something I didn't expect nor want. I paid for my service and left. I know that hair stylist have good days and bad days. It's unfortunate this was a bad day."

As someone who uses their hands a lot, I can't keep a regular manicure on for more than a day. But CND shellac manicures will stay on for at least 2 weeks for me.

Spa Aria had all the correct equipment for CND - including some of the newest colors. But the execution was poor. To start the manicurist almost started painting my nails with all my nails at different lengths. I asked her if she could trim them all down to the same length and she seemed miffed that I would ask for this. They were pretty grossly different in length. Also she did not ask if I preferred an oval or a square filed tip. The polish was applied and cured correctly with the exception of the area around the cuticles and skin. The manicurist was sloppy and some of the polish got on the skin around the base and side of the nail. This is no good with shellac because it makes the bases peel. It didn't look that sloppy right away but once the polish started to come away from the skin and peel, it was very obvious. She did a great job with the tips however, which are all still intact, but I've had to peel away the polish at the base of nails and it is uneven and doesn't look as well. True to CND Shellac, the rest of the shellac looks great and shiny even 1.5 weeks later."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,I cancelled this membership in September. The woman who did my massage was very rude and rude. I will never go back to this location. Not worth the money.This place is amazing! I came in on a Tuesday to get a gel manicure. I got a gel manicure with gel polish. I was very impressed with the quality and attention to detail. I've had great gel manicures in the past and this was by far the best one I've ever had. The salon was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back!I just moved to Tucson from California and have been looking for a place to get my nails done. I came across this place on yelp and I'm so glad I did! I was a bit nervous about getting my nails done because I'm very picky about the length of my nails but I was pleasantly surprised. I got a gel manicure and I didn't get a single chip. The lady who did my nails was very nice and did a great job. She made sure to ask me what I wanted and I told her a lot. She also talked me about my nails as she went to her for her choices which I didn't like. She also. She made sure I liked. I liked the shape. She got the dip powder which I
Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS NAIL SALON. I visited Annie's Nails in Fairless Hills yesterday, and it was my first time getting a manicure and pedicure there. During the mani pedi, the man who was doing my nails was very rude the entire time (literally scoffing when he found a callus on my foot--if I didn't have calluses, why would I need a pedicure?) and applied extremely thick and bubbly layers of polish. 6 hours after the fact it still was not dry, and I could not touch ANYTHING without it getting nicked or messed up. By the next day, the entire mani pedi was destroyed, and right now, over 12 hours later, it is still not dry because of how much polish was put on.
This morning I went back, and tried to tell them what had happened and asked for my money back. They told me it was not their policy to issue refunds and that they were too busy to repaint them. The workers repeatedly talked over me, telling me that the manager wasn't there, and then laughed in my face and walked to the back. I then called the manager, who talked to me with the same arrogance and disregard.
I have had my nails done at a number of salons in LMT and have always had great experiences. I have never been treated so rudely by any establishment in LMT and am honestly just dumbfounded. Please, if you're looking for your July 4th mani pedi, go see one of the other amazing establishments in LMT that has more respect for their own work and customers."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I won't be back...Judge for what you get. 

I have been going to this location for a year.  The front desk is very friendly, and the owner is very accommodating.  They offer complimentary drinks and even wine.  I have never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a mani or pedi.  I can't wait to go back!I love this place. It's very clean and spacious. The staff is friendly and professional. I love that they do a lot of nail designs and they have a wide range of nail colors. They are usually very busy but it's a good sign that they take walk-ins. I love how they offer you a drink as well. They have a wide variety of colors to choose from. I've had a gel manicure and a pedicure done by the owner and I've always left happy. I love the fact that they have a wide selection of colors. I've also had a gel manicure and pedicure done by the owner. They do a great job. I've seen them do a great job on my nails. They do a great job on my nails and I've always come back and have a great job on my toes. I also. The pedicures. I've been a regular pedicure."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Brian is a great healer and I would strongly recommend him to anyone who is looking for relief from chronic pain or muscle tightness, or for anyone who is looking to improve their overall health and posture.  

I came to Brian looking to get rid of some tightness in my upper back, as well as some limited mobility and pain in my lower left back.  Brian was a great resource from the start of session 1-- not only in terms of providing measurable relief through his bodywork on a weekly basis, but also in terms of helping me to understand areas of weakness in my posture.  After a few sessions, Brian helped to educate me on easy ways I could improve stability and balance on a daily basis--recommendations included yoga stretches, self-massage tools, and even a new vertical mouse to ease tension on my back!  

After just a few sessions, the giant knot in my back that had been there for years was gone, and I could see a measurable difference in how my body felt after working out-- I had more mobility, as well as awareness as to how I could avoid falling back into old routines.  After my 10 sessions, I can honestly say that many of my residue body aches and pains are no longer with me-- plus I learned how to prevent them from returning! 

I'm so happy I decided to check Brian out-- he's got a great personality, is fun and easy to work with, and one of the best holistic body work professionals I have ever met."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I booked with Blue Line and it was the best experience I have ever had. I was greeted by a very friendly woman and I was offered a beverage as soon as I walked in.

I will definitely be back!I had an excellent experience at this location! My sister had a very bad experience with her hair colorist and I couldn't go back to her. I showed her a picture of what I wanted, and she delivered! She is very knowledgeable and super nice! Will definitely be back!I have been here twice. The first time I was in I was given a Groupon to get a gel mani and pedi. I had an appointment for 3:30 and the technician was running late. I was told that I could come back at 2:15.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"If I could give ZERO stars I would. I went in for a simple gel manicure and the woman doing it had a bad attitude. I asked her if she could take it off and she said yes. It was clear she was annoyed and told me I had to pay for the gel and a manger was taking the gel off. I told her I would like to pay $10 for my nails to be done correctly and she said yes. I told her I would like to have it taken off and she said I would have to pay extra for it. I was just in shock and will not be returning. I have never had a gel manicure last that long. I was shocked at how much I was treated to. I went in to get my nails painted and it was $10 more than what I normally pay. I have no idea how this business would treat their customers. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I would not recommend this place to anyone.I'm not sure about this place. I've been coming here for about 4 years.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"As a generally optimistic girl and after reading all the good reviews about this salon, I was almost positive that I would love Heads & Tails. (I had never read so many raving reviews about something as painful as a bikini wax!)  But as most girls know, there is ALWAYS that lingering doubt when someone new styles your hair. I can happily say that you have nothing to fear when you make an appointment at Heads & Tails. I arrived to my appointment about 20 minutes early and was greeted right away by Dana and offered drinks/snacks. It may seem like a small detail, but after a stressful day at work and a day of travel ahead, it was sooo nice to be able to relax. I got a wash and blow out kind just for the hell of it because I never treat myself, but asked Dana to do a sort of side fishtail braid. I was very vague in explaining what I wanted, but Dana knew exactly what I wanted done. I appreciated how the uses/benefits of the salon's products were explained and also how all of my questions about my own personal hair woes were answered with practical solutions!

Bottom line: If you're going out for the night or just want to treat yourself, go to Heads & Tails!  I will definitely be going back. I cannot think of one negative thing to say. The decor was beautiful, Dana was hilarious/a great stylist and when I met my friends later that night, everyone loved my hair."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"So when I was visiting some friends for the weekend in St. Pete, we had decided to have unlimited mimosas for brunch, with food of course. It was on our way there that we were super excited about the day to come, and somehow got on the topic of massages. My friend's husband said he frequents a place nearby that is very affordable at about $30 a pop and super relaxing. My friend then said she has been too and it's awesome. The true purpose of my visit was an internship interview, and with the stress high, one of us suggested we go. Without a second to hesitate, we all jumped on the bandwagon, and before we even arrived to brunch we had 3 appointments booked for 3 massages THAT day. 

There were no hiccups, no issues at all. When we arrived, I had to fill out some short paperwork and consent forms. I then was seen by Alexandra, who has so sweet and nice. I was brought to the private room where I put my stuff in a bag on the back of the door and she waited outside. She gave a very thorough and perfect massage for about 45 minutes for $30. Afterwards, we of course compared massueses and I was biased but thought my massage was the best value, with a head, foot, back, and arm massage included. She was attentive and asked where I needed focus (my back) and asked questions occasionally. Overall, it was just what we needed and if I lived here I would be a frequent visitor. Highly recommended and SO affordable."

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"The first haircut I got there with Antwan was amazing! He did such a good job that when I needed a haircut again, I immediately hopped on their website to book him again. 

Here's where it went wrong:

I booked Antwan for a $60 Benchmark cut (which includes -Relaxing spa services - paraffin hand dip, scalp massage, pressure point facial massage, steamed towel and stress-relieving hand massage
 And -Your experience is completed with our finishing touch styling and a demonstration on how to best style your hair every day). When I showed up, they gave me a different stylist, who I didn't even know. 

This stylist washed my hair and did the ""scalp massage"" as quickly and roughly as possible. I didn't receive any of the other services I booked. I didn't ask while I was there as I was just ready to get the haircut over with at that point. 

I wear glasses, so I couldn't see during my hair cut. When I got home I saw that she took the right side of my hairline back almost an inch for no good reason. The left side was untouched. Part of my neck still had hair. (The top of the hair and the fade did look good.) I was so disappointed and now my hair looks goofy as hell. 

They ended up only doing the basic $45 express cut for me when that was not what I had booked the appointment for. 

I am a student who really wanted to treat themselves after a stressful time. Boardroom really dropped the ball and left me not wanting to ever come back."

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I used to be loyal to one stylist, but it just got so hard having to go all the way to the ends of the earth in West county to see her.  So over time, I have tried a few places.  Let me tell you I'm scarred.  I have tried places where they literally botch my hair past the point of fixing. So I was very hesitant to try places.   
I made an appoint using Yelp.  They were nice enough to fit me in on the same day appointment.  This I'm finding is hard.  (side note- not a really great business model guys.  I have no idea what I will be doing two weeks from now but I can tell you it's not cutting my hair).  The girl I was supposed to meet had a last min emergency.  Since I was new I wasn't put off.  
Enter Taylor.  Man, she was great! Professional and listened to what I wanted.  She offered suggestions but throughout she asked me what I liked and I never once felt like my hair was going to turn out horrible.  She talked with my daughter the entire time( not easy because that kid can talk if she likes you).  I left feeling satisfied with my new cut and I am a return customer! 
The place itself is very nice on the inside but not at all stuffy and pretentious.  It is a very warm stylish inviting atmosphere. Me and my girl will be back and I'm telling all my friends!"

Laura just gets my hair and we hit it off immediately. She is chill as a cucumber and just puts me at ease. I always go in with a bun that's the size of a cantaloupe and I come out with goddess hair. She works her magic and I always always always love the outcome I have never had to go home and trim something or just live with it because it will grow out. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED THIS but no Laura is amazing and I would recommend her to everyone but I am not going to because I am selfish and I don't want everyone else to have amazing hair!!!!!!!  

Upon every arrival I am always greeted with a warm smile and welcome. The vibe is relaxing and they have a treats table with coffee and beer and/or other refreshments. Cookie and a Cut? yes please. Also please take a chance to use the bathroom. I love there bathroom!!!

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I have been quite disappointed by my experience at Plastic Surgery Affiliates. I purchased a Groupon for hair removal-full legs & Brazilian. The original laser provided some hair reduction but not full removal. They replaced this laser & the new one is quite painful & not any more effective. I had purchased permanent make up - upper & lower eye liner.  Auri worked on the upper eye liner and it did not work.  She told me that if the eye liner process did not work, they would provide both reimbursement for unused service and give a credit I could use for the.  She told me multiple times over many months that they would process the refund, but each time, there has been no refund.  The last time I went to the office for an appt,  she told me that they had sent out refund & gift credit the week before (which was not true). The following day she sent me the $100 gift card but has not followed up on the other commitments she made that day & the following week.  After a few weeks we were able to discuss and come to a resolution where partial refund was provided (covering the lower eye liner services) and I returned the $100 gift card as I don't plan to use or recommend their services to others.

There are better places where you can get full hair removal.  I went to a place in Brentwood that fully removed all hair in my underarm area - Rejuvenation Group in Brentwood  - much better results.  Go there instead."

My boyfriend came out almost bald, and I went in with shoulder length hair asked for a trim 1/4 inch, I came out in tears, not only did the stylist take off 3+ inches it was extremely crooked about half an inch longer on one side.  The cut was so bad my ends looked worse than when I went in, I'm not sure if the scissors were dull, or the stylist just incompetent.  It literally looked like the cut a 2 year old little girl gets, there was no shape or style left to my hair at all.  I had to go to another salon and have them fix it and even that stylist couldn't believe I had to pay for such an awful cut, she was disgusted.

On top of the terrible hair cuts the place was filthy, the floor was covered in so much hair it was stuck on the walls and trim, I don't think they'd swept for days, then when he got the brushes out I was just appalled there was so much hair in them I was honestly afraid I was going to come out of there with head lice.

They were also not personable or friendly, I think they spoke 20 words tops to us the whole time we were there.  We just were uncomfortable with the whole experience and will never again give our business to this disgraceful establishment.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I'm really stingy with my five star ratings--especially if I've only been there once--but this place totally earned it. It's basically like they took everything I want in a nail salon-cleanliness, relaxation, friendliness, quiet/no need to make small talk, great selection of polishes-and put it into one place. 

From the moment I walked in the door, I became relaxed. The lighting is dim and relaxing (no fluorescent lights here!) and there is spa-like music playing. 

The guy behind the desk greeted me (yes, greeted, and didn't just yell ""write down your name on the list!"") and asked how he could make me happier today.

In fact, there is no yelling at all, and the employees are all extremely professional. From what they wear (light grey smock tops with name tags) to how they work (all the attention is on your nails-there really isn't any talking between the techs), and all of the instruments are clean.

For my first visit I opted to get the ""express pedicure"" because I wanted to see what their ""basics"" were like. The massage chair was great, and my nail tech Lisa was very attentive with every single toe but managed to finish quickly since it was an express pedicure.

Overall, I am really really happy I've found my new mani/pedi place. It is night and day from my experience with Signature Nails that is only about two minutes away. Can't wait to get back to Luxecares and get a shellac manicure.

I have terrible posture and tend to stand with all my weight on one side, and she worked on my back accordingly and showed me stretches I can do to help while I'm at work.

The whole building smells of essential oils and whatever they use during the massage smells wonderful and isn't overly greasy.

On my first visit I received the new client special and liked the massage so much I purchased the Yelp Deal to save as a treat for my birthday. When I called about today's appointment I asked if I could book a 90 min massage and just pay the difference since it was my birthday treat to myself and was told no problem. When I asked what I owed, Jen and the other girl at the desk told me $5. they had given me the birthday discount as well! It was such a nice surprise and really put the experience over the top."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"In a time where COVID-19 is starting to go up again, it's definitely crucial making sure you're not a carrier when you're asymptomatic.

I'm hoping to see my family for Thanksgiving and wanted to make sure I'll be able to and not be a carrier for my family.

This location was amazing and the staff was so kind. They informed me they were able to accept COVID-19 rapid testing walk-ins and I got there as quick as I could.

You check-in in person; however, you can make an appointment for a future date online.

I'm fortunate enough my company provides quality insurance that covers such testing, so I know this might not be as accessible to everyone.

I waited in my car and they gave me a phone call when it was my turn. They have the lobby spaced out but I didn't feel comfortable. I really appreciate them giving me the option.

Once I was summoned, I took the now famous ""lobotomy test"" through the nose. They swab both nostrils and they go deep with the swab. Does it hurt? Yes, for a minute or two. But I'd rather have a proper reading than to be comfortable.

I waited for about 20 minutes once they did my swab and was called again (I waited outside this time) to come back. They brought me into a room to give me my results.

I was negative (yay!) and was dismissed.

One thing to note is that there is some fluctuation of accuracy to keep in mind. I have an appointment booked for Thursday to make sure I'm absolutely good to go while staying at home.

Thank you to the team here for making it so accessible."
Beauty & Spas,2.0,CG,"I don't normally go to spas, but I decided to try this place for the first time. I had an appointment with Melissa, and she was great! She took her time and made sure I was comfortable. She even gave me a sample of water and water to drink. I also love that they use a hot towel and are very sanitary. I will definitely be back. I will be back.Came here for my first Brazilian wax. I was nervous because I'm from out of town, but I was so pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure what she was talking about, but it was a little more pleasant than some other waxing places I've been to. The location is super cute and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for a wax.I am so happy I found this place! I was going to a new place and had a terrible experience. I went to a different nail salon and the girl that did my nails was very rough and hurt my skin. The guy who did my nails was rough and it was so painful! I told him to stop and he did not to stop and he was very rough and I said it was going back to cry. I told him to go back and he said it was bleeding. I will not go to the next time. I'm done and he said ok I'll come"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I was introduced to Heather Schollmeier through my sister nearly 5 years ago and I have gone out of my way to have Heather cut my hair since. I have actually never lived in Indianapolis and have driven at least an HOUR just for her to cut and style my hair because she's simply wonderful. 

The salon is clean, fun, vibrant, in a great location with plenty of parking. The other stylists are kind, chatty, and fun; you can tell all customers are repeat customers who LOVE their stylists.  Jay at the front desk is funny and polite, always makes me feel welcome. It's the most positive environment.

Heather gives honest opinions, is supportive of your ideas, and is incredibly knowledgable. When I first started going to her, I really wanted dramatic bangs cut into my really long hair (my previous stylist refused to cut them because she feared I'd be unhappy). Heather saw how excited I was about it and helped me take the plunge and I loved them! Whenever I was ready to shake things up, Heather gave fun ideas and helped me experiement (within my means). She is the best hair stylist I have ever been to and it breaks my heart to leave her (I am moving to Texas for work).

If you're in the market for a new stylist and want someone who gives great head massages, has helpful tips if you are learning how to style your own hair (I have successfully learned to ""blow out"" my own hair thanks to her!), carries wonderful conversations, and is a beautiful person through and through, check out Heather and the other stylists here!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I hate talking about places that say you are going to be rude or make you feel like you are a bother. The people that work here are the worst. They should be ashamed of their customers and not be treated like a bother. This is the worst place I have ever been to. They are the most rude, disrespectful, and mean people I've ever met. I will never come here again. They should be ashamed of themselves. I will never come back here again. I will never recommend anyone to this place. They are the worst. Do NOT go here. They will rush you out of the door. They do not even care about you. If you don't like to be rude to them, they will do what they want to do. Don't even bother going here. I will never recommend anyone here. I recommend anyone to stay away from this place. My nail tech was very thorough and patient and did a good job. I was very pleased with the color selection.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I am extremely anal about my hairstyle. In fact, I have attempted so many barbershops throughout Indy and have to no avail been able to find my star-crossed barber. How fate brought me to Jack's Barbershop is a miracle! 

I absolutely love visiting the girls at Jack's! Each one of them has their own special and charming personality that complements each other so well to create such a welcoming and entertaining experience! My girl, Aksana, just understands my distinct hairstyle! Together, we always attempt different hairstyles until we discover the right one that uniquely works for me! Only when we find that perfect style will we host a mini-photoshoot to showcase her astounding masterpiece!

My partner absolutely adores Faith and all her precision and advice on maintaining his beard! After his recent ear surgery, Faith was extra conscious about his pain and still provided excellent service that exceeded his meticulous standards! 

Of course, no review for Jack's would be complete without acknowledging Brenda. She is definitely one of those rare and beautiful individuals who's genuine laughter and smile are so infectious that they that would brighten anyone's day! Although some would say her behavior is rather risqué, I personally enjoy and appreciate her bold character and candid disposition! I honestly believe we need more people like Brenda in the world!

I would strongly recommend Jack's Barbershop to anyone who is searching for an affordable and quality haircut! These ladies are certainly mavens of their craft! I cannot express enough how much I enjoy visiting each one of them and how much I appreciate their impeccable service! We love you, Jack's Barbershop, and we cannot wait until our next visit!"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I reviewed the place before but the review must have been taken down. Consider this my update as a visited two times-

The place is tucked away by the Marriott which is a bit awkward. Once you enter, very friendly staff. They immediately offer you a beverage and it was quite refreshing. The changing room is very odd to me, over 30 lockers. How many woman can be in attendance at once?  I am more appreciative of private rooms, not locker rooms. However, there is a changing area with a very shear (too shear) curtain.  I was not a fan. 

The transition room (foot bath) was nice, but I felt like I was left there a bit too long. My suggestion for staff would be to survey guests on a time preference. The first visit I went, my masseuse must have run over as i was escorted to the brining room next. This was nice but a bit cold, with purpose. The massage was okay. I had a level one lady and she was part time. I would definitely get a level two next time. 

My second visit I got a body creame float. I absolutely loved it. It was a very refreshing experience for my skin and body. My attendant was amazing, friendly and knowledgeable. The float is the slightest bit Claustrophobic, however I enjoyed being wrapped tight. 

All in all, nice place. I think it needs more TLC to be brought up to ""cozy"". Right now it feels too new and cold. Even some laminate floor boards are shifting due to poor or negligence in installation. Small fixes could bring this place to 5 stars."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I have been going to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk.  The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly.  

The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language.  I have been going to this nail salon for over a year now and I am really happy with the service and the quality of the work.  It is a very good place for a pedicure and manicure.  I only go to them because it is convenient.  

I have also tried the gel polish and my nails have never chipped.  They always last me a while.  I recommend this place to anyone.  I have been getting my nails done at other places for about 7 years and this is by far the best one I have had.I'm very particular about the hair color and cut.

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"My path led me here because I was doing research on balayage and found that Bobby Mack was one of the few places in Philadelphia that did it. I am so grateful for finding such a special place!

At my first appointment, I walked in with orange-y striped nightmare hair due to an unfortunate experience at a salon in Queen Village. I could feel the looks of sympathy from staff and clients alike. I was scheduled to work with Erin (who I think might be one of my favorite people). She instantly made me feel comfortable. By the time Erin was finished with me, my nightmare hair turned into a dream. I'm pretty sure everyone cheered. Seriously, it was like a dramatic makeover that would've made entertaining television.

The salon is so comfortable and the entire staff is so warm and lovely. James is a sweetheart and will really make you feel taken care of from the moment you walk in. He has a way of making you feel like you've been a client for 20 years whether you're on the phone with him or in person. Erin listens to what kind of results I'm looking for while giving her welcomed opinion...she's easy to talk to (and I'm sometimes an awkward conversationalist so this is saying a lot), she's freaking hilarious, she's kind, and she is an excellent stylist. Not to mention that she's one of the VERY few stylists I've been to who doesn't make me feel like a burden for having a ton of hair.

I can't recommend Bobby Mack enough. It's a truly wonderful atmosphere generated by a group of wonderful and talented people. Nothing but love for them!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I have been going to this salon for years and I mean years - even through different management. I go at least once a month for nail gel dip, sometimes I add a pedi, and eyebrows. I usually go on Sundays and there's hardly EVER a wait. Today was different and I'm blaming wait time on schools starting tomorrow. No problem - I was okay with the wait. Got there 5 minutes before salon open but clients were already at stations being serviced. That's ok I'm good. My name was the first on the list. When I was finally called to a chair 30 minutes later, I was told that I would have to let my nails soak. Ok no problem BUT the tech ALWAYS files off whatever the top layer is so that as I soak, the polish will come off quicker. The tech quickly placed the bowl of remover at my spot and told me to start soaking as she then went to sit at least 5 other clients that were after me. I waited a second and when I caught her attention, I asked if I was going to get my nails filed first. The tech said, ""No I don't have time!"" WHAT?!?! So what was going to happen was I would sit for an hour to soak my nails as other clients behind me were served. NOPE - what do you mean you don't have time?? I politely grabbed my items and went somewhere else. I guess my loyalty didn't matter - well my money won't matter there anymore either. Nail shops are a dime a dozen in Florissant. Extremely disappointed in the service today."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,This was my first visit here. The woman who did my pedicure did a great job. She took her time and did a great job. The salon is clean and very relaxing. I will definitely come back. I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. I always get a great haircut at the same time. I've had 3 different barbers there and have had a great cut each time. The last one I tried was very rushed. The guy who cut my hair did not seem to know what he was doing. I was just in a rush to get out of there so that was fine. I've had my hair cut in the past and I've never been to a barber shop where you're treated like a child. I will not be coming here again. I have been going to this place since I moved to Tampa from California. I have always had a great experience. I have been to several different nail salons in St. Louis and this is the best one I have been to. My nails always look great! I always get a gel mani and pedi and I always leave happy with the color. I never leave there feeling like a new girl!I'm new to try to write a new place and maybe I'm a new place in the new stylist and found my new one.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"People kill me with their criticism of this place. It's a beauty school for crying out loud!  I've been coming here off and on since i was in middle school and they were located on Manchester on Ballwin. Things i won't get here: nails,  pedicures, waxing. I had one of the best pedicures ever here when i was on high school.  The woman was awesome (i think her name was Ros)!   The next time i got one here,  it was terrible (no, it wasn't with Ros)!  I got my face and eyebrows waxed here a few times a long time ago and i ultimately stopped because i didn't like the service i received,  not the results, the service.  

Service here is hit or miss with most things you can get here. I'm not a fan of the receptionist here because she is horrible at communicating the deep conditioning that i always order with the stylist/student. It's always an issue and for no reason! 

My hair is always done well here though.  The techniques used by the stylists are different but always lead to the same result. I've only dealt with one stylist that i found unprofessional but again,  she had my hair looking good! 

All in all,  as with most things you get what you pay for.  I've had my hair done for 3 times as much at a professional hair salon and experienced long waits,  unprofessional behavior,  and poor service. For $25 to get the same style but with a shorter wait and same result, i think it's worth it. Just remember they're students."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I have been to Cozy Nails the total of 3 times, and they did a nice job on my nails every time.  The first and second time I went the people who worked there were nice, and there were several customers there.  The third time (and the last time) was a few days ago, there were only the two nail techs but no customers. When I went into the salon, I was not even greeted with a simple hello.  Tony asked me what I wanted.  I said I wanted to get fills.  He told me to sign in and pick a nail color.  When Tony did my nails he just filed off the part of the nail were it had grown out, applied new acrylic, and filed the nail to blend in the new acrylic with the old.  It was like he was being stingy with the acrylic.  I lady nail tech (not sure what her name was) told me it would only take five minutes to dry, so I sat on the chair with me hands under the heat lamp for about 10 minutes to make sure my nails were dry.  While I was sitting with my hands under the heat lamp the lady nail tech kept starring at me.  I finally said have a nice day and left.  Very rude employees.  With a nail salon on practically  on every corner, I personally don't see them staying in business that long due to their lack of customer service and doing a half hazard job on the acrylic nails.  I know I certainly will not be returning."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"My friend and I were celebrating my birthday down in Santa Barbara last weekend and we really wanted to get massages! We went to another place first and the lady was really rude to us so we left. This place was perfect! And a lot cheaper than the place we were going to go. I've had a lot of massages and this one was for sure one of the best ones! I was very skeptical at first because you stay clothed and it was just not the normal environment for a massage. But I was for sure proven wrong.

We waited less than 5 minutes to be put at a table. You put your stuff under the massage table and lay on top. Face down the whole time. We did the 60 minute full body massage. I was so surprised at how relaxing it was! I honestly was not expecting my massage to be as incredible as it was. And it's not like other places where they use waaaay too much pressure. This place is just right. And they make sure to ask if they are using too much pressure or if you are alright.

After the massage was over, or so I thought, they sit you up and rub your shoulders, neck, and back for another 3-5 minutes and then you pay! Such a relaxing break for my friend and I. She also enjoyed her massage. We talked about it the rest of the day.

The cost of our massage was $35 and then I tipped $15. I would 100% recommend trying this place out. It's right on State Street and it gives you time to escape the busy streets for a bit."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,Let me just start off by saying I am very picky about my hair. I have been to other places in the area and this is by far the best haircut I have ever had. She is extremely personable and very professional. I can't imagine going to anyone else now! I always get compliments on my hair! I also love the fact that she is a talented stylist. I just went to her for a color and cut. It was an amazing experience and I will be going to her again soon. I would recommend her to anyone who asks! She is so sweet and so sweet! I am so happy that I found her!I went in for a gel manicure and I loved it! They do a great job and I think the prices are very reasonable. My gel manicure lasted about 3 weeks. I have no complaints about this place. I will definitely be back!I've been coming to this nail salon for a few months now. I've always had a great experience. They do a great job on my mani/pedi. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. They always ask if you if you're happy with your nails. I never feel rushed to try something new. I have a great experience and have a great time! I just had a great experience here. My nails and this is a good time there. I love it. Great service.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I can't tell you how nervous I was about getting my haircut here, despite reading (mostly) excellent Yelp reviews. I wanted to chop off a 12 inch ponytail and donate it to Pantene's Beautiful Lengths program, and I was worried that they wouldn't understand my broken Chinese and give me a terrible bowl cut or something. Which has happened before. Let's just say that junior year of high school was not a good look for me. 

Anyway, I called the day before and asked if I needed to make an appointment and they recommended I do, so I did. When I arrived the next day (it was a Saturday afternoon around 4pm), I was pretty much the only customer for a good twenty minutes, which meant I got to get my hair cut by Kevin! The girl who washed my hair and gave me the massage was really sweet, and we had a nice little conversation on whether or not I would miss my hair. Kevin was also really friendly but not super talkative, which I appreciated. I'm always wary when stylists recommend what they think would look good (exhibit A: junior year bowl cut), but Kevin definitely knows what he's doing. He also gave me some tips on how to style/blow dry my hair. From time to time, he would go over to his adorable little daughter (who was starting kindergarten the next week, as he proudly told me!) and compliment her drawing/coloring, which made me feel right at home. 

All in all, great service! $25 + tip is completely worth it. I didn't miss my long hair at all! Thanks Kevin and sorry for this well-deserved but super belated review!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"I have had a number of massages at spas in the past, and this was one of the worst experiences I've had. I have been to a number of spas and this is by far the worst. The massage was extremely rushed. My boyfriend and I were both in the massage room before our massage, and it was a very uncomfortable and uncomfortable experience. We had to go home and re-adjust our clothes to go to the shower. The therapist didn't speak English, and did not speak very good English. She was very rough with my hands, and I was very upset with the massage. I would have liked to have been more clear if she was more gentle, but I did not enjoy the massage. I left with sore feet and my boyfriend's hands were sore after. I wish I had been aware of this before I left. I will not be returning. My friend and I went to Viva Nails yesterday. I was a little hesitant because I had heard great things about this place. The atmosphere was very friendly, and they took their time. I was able to get a manicure and pedicure and was very happy with the service. I got my nails done with the massage. I got a gel manicure. I am very happy with the dip powder manicure.

The salon is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. I've never had to wait more than a minute and a half to get a haircut. I highly recommend this salon!I went to this place because I was in the area and I was happy to get my hair cut at the same price. I got a basic men's haircut, which included a scalp massage, shampoo, neck massage, and a head massage. I am a hairstylist and wanted to try something new. I came in, waited for about 15 minutes, and was given a stylist to cut my hair. I had an appointment, and she cut my hair. I was not pleased with the cut. I asked her to go back to the back to have the layers cut down. She cut them down to a short length, and gave me a straight line. I was very unhappy with the results, so I went back to the salon to ask for a different stylist, and was told that she couldn't cut my hair. I needed to go back to have a nice layers, and she cut it down and to go back to the back. I was told her that I wanted my hair down to shorter. I wanted a nice layers"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I did a facial, manicure, pedicure and a Swedish massage. The manicure and pedicure was nice. The chairs are comfortable, they provided water and the people are friendly. However, the facial is not worth the money. It felt like they just put a whole bunch of liquid on your face and rubbed it around. I didn't see any difference with my before and after look. As I have done this many other times in Hawaii and could always notice the difference. Your face feels cleaner and fresh. Mine didn't feel that way here. Their swedish massage is done in the back room, which is a nice size, and comfortable. You can hear the noise outside so it wasn't as peaceful as it should have been but I didn't mind cause I was going to get me a massage. Unfortunately, the lady took it upon herself to do a deep tissue massage when I had said Swedish. She focused on one of the knots in my back under my shoulder blade, which is fine as I have had this happen before and know that they are just trying to ease the knot and relax the muscle. But when I left their I felt really sick which is normal but I also felt pain in my back when I left. I thought the pain would go away but it has been two months and I still have pains in my back where she focus primarily on and it feels like its traveling to my shoulders. I have schedule me a Dr. appt to see what is going on and why I am in so much pain. Wouldn't recommend doing anything else but mani and pedi."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"First, let me start off by saying I was pretty nervous about going to get my haircut and style at a place I had never been before and in a city where my last visit was back in 2005. Yup. Two. Thousand. Five. Boy, oh boy, was I in for a treat! When I arrived there was upbeat music playing, people bustling about and a general buzz that clearly said fun & high energy. My nervousness was quickly replaced by excitement. I was greeted and introduced to my stylist, Megan (goodness me, I hope I'm spelling her name correctly!). She was very warm and friendly. She sat me down and started chatting about my hair and what I was looking to do. I was so overdue for a haircut and hoped she understood me when I said I needed a trim especially to clean up the split ends but really wanted to keep the length. She got it and went to work. I got one of the most relaxing shampoos - I didn't want it to end! Then the magic began. She started cutting my hair. I knew right away it was going to end up looking amazing. The conversation was fun and we talked about hair, good spots to go in New Orleans, our kids - pretty much a variety of topics. When she was done blowing out my hair... Oh. My. Goodness! Truly sexy hair! I loved it! Megan did a tremendous job and I would not hesitate to recommend her and Beauty Lounge to anyone whether you're local or in town to visit. If you want a great hair experience, go and ask for Megan =) You won't regret it!"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"Yall...Hannah, this amazing nail technician, is an amazing artist! Her work is impeccable and I am always so happy with the way my nails look. 

I have had a lot of bad experiences with other nail salons, so I was excited to try out this place. The reviews were great, so I was excited to try it out. I made an appointment for 3:00am for my sister, and I were there for an hour and a half. When I got there, it was 11:30am, so I was seated immediately. When I got up to pay, I was told that my sister had a different tech, but I could only pay $10 for a full set of acrylics. I was then told that my sister had a different tech, and that she was going to pay $30 for a full set of acrylics. I paid and left. I was very upset that I was charged $30 for a full set of acrylics that I had to pay $45 for. I went to the salon and explained that I had a broken set of acrylics, and was told that my sister had them broken, and that she had to have a broken and that it. I had to have a broken them, and that my sister come back to pay. She said that day to come back in and I should have to get my money back."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,Worst customer service EVER. They have the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I will never go back. The front desk girl was very rude and didn't seem to care that I was there. I will NEVER go back. This was my first time coming here and I was looking for a place to go. I have never had a bad experience. I will never go back to this place. The only reason I gave a 2 star is because they do not offer massages. I have been going to this place for a few years and have never been disappointed. I have never had a bad experience here. I would recommend it to anyone. I have been to a few different nail salons in the area and I have finally found my go to!  I have been to many different nail salons over the years and this is the only place that I have tried that I will go back to. My favorite is the atmosphere of the place. The decor is modern and very modern. I have seen many different nail techs and have never had a bad experience. and they all have done an excellent job. I have seen a good experience. pedicure and a great   and will go back again. dip powder manicure. I highly recommend this place to everyone.
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"I hate writing negative reviews, but unfortunately my experience at this salon warrants one. I strongly recommend against getting your nails done here, I'm not even sure how they can call themselves a business. These people have no idea what they are doing. I went in to get a dip manicure and regular pedicure. To be fair, the pedicure went okay and looks fine (a kind older gentleman did the pedicure.) The manicure, however, was done by a different woman and was a disaster from start to finish. I don't claim to be a nail expert but I've had my nails done hundreds of time and I've never seen them done in such a sloppy, unprofessional manner. I wanted blue French tips to begin with, but my pedicure had taken so long that I kindly told the woman I just wanted clear dip nails to save time (not a big deal.) She fumbled through the manicure and at one point it felt like she painted super glue onto my nails. It was going so poorly that I tried to leave in the middle of the manicure- I figured I'd go get them fixed somewhere else, I just didn't want to waste anymore time here. She begged for 5 more minutes and this is how they came out. Unfortunately I wasted $50 on this atrocious manicure. When I asked further questions about the price and stated that I was unsatisfied, they didn't budge and did not try to make things right. I am never rude to people who are providing me a service, so I tipped both my technicians and thanked them for their time at the end. But I will obviously not be back."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I ran in to Magic Nails on a whim, late in the afternoon for a gel polish change. I wasn't going to be overly picky about the color, since I'm planning to get another gel mani on Monday before I head out of town. I was mainly concerned with getting some polish on so my nails wouldn't break before my next nail appt.

The place is nice, the folks are friendly and I was able to get right in.

So, EVEN THOUGH I wasn't going to be anal about having *exactly* the perfect color, I was irked when they didn't have ANY of the shades that I picked. I finally just went with what the tech suggested - a lightish pink, which is SO not me - mostly bc I just wanted this to be done quickly.

I'm finding this to be the case more and more often these days - if you're looking for the neutral range
- #104 or #105 (I forget which brand it is - not OPI) EVERY salon is out. Seriously, if these shades are your ""best sellers"" then freaking keep them in stock! It's not complicated, really.

My only other ""complaint"" which isn't really a complaint is having to get up and go to a sink to wash my hands - twice. That's not a total deal breaker, but it can sway me from one salon to another.

My tech did *exactly* what I requested and did not shorten my nails at all. She shaped them beautifully, and three days later the polish is holding firm. The polish change (no mani) was $25 so very reasonable!

Magic Nails won't be my first choice in Reno nail salons, but it's definitely in the #2 fallback position."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I'm picky when it comes to my nails. I've been to a lot of nail salons and this one was the best I've ever been to! I got a gel manicure and it came out great. I will definitely be going back.I was looking for a good salon with reasonable prices. I was a bit disappointed with the service I received from the front desk. I made an appointment for a pedicure and it was on time. I arrived about 30 minutes before my appointment time and was seated for my pedicure. I was not asked what services I wanted, and I was told to pick out a color. I picked out a pedicure. I was asked what color I wanted, and the person I had was rude and didn't ask for it. I was seated for a pedicure, which was fine, until my technician began to do my toes. When I was done, the polish on my toes had already started to chip, and they didn't even clean it up. When I was done, the technician asked me to pay and I told her that I was there. She then told me that I would have to pay. I should have to pay for a tip her. I would be tipping her. I would tip her and I would be charged. I would have my tip her tip her. I pay. I would have tipped her, which I had"
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"My sister brought me here for my birthday and the gentleman that was doing my pedicure acted as if he was scared of touching feet, which my feet get done every two weeks in another place That I've been going to for 15 years. I asked for someone else there was no one else to do my feet so my sister and I spoke to the owner so he says he is at the front he said he would go ahead and have me come back in after the cove it and redo my feet for free of charge. I Called and made an appointment which the so-called owner answered the phone I explain to him to remind him of what had happened he said yes yes he remembered me and it would be free of charge. I then came in for my appointment And brought my niece with me and when it came time to pay the so-called owner charged me double and when I mentioned to him that I had spoken to him and reminded him what was going on with my feet he told me he would never give anything for you no matter whatever happened in his place of business. He then insulted my sister. Ithen again asked him what was going To happen with the charge of my pedicure and he said I had to pay it he gives nothing for free again so I then said to him he was a liar. I will never return there or bring anyone with me because I do not like to deal with liars and cannot trust a liar and someone who insults a customer that's been going there since they've opened."

She takes her time to understand what you want and is very professional. I look forward to my next visit!I have been going to this salon for about 5 years.  I have never had a bad experience.  The salon is clean and has great music playing.  I have tried a few salons in the area and have never been disappointed.   I have gone to other salons but this one is the best.  They are clean, professional and always have a smile on their face.  I have not had a bad experience there.  I highly recommend going to this salon.I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I asked for a little longer but she made it as short as possible. I asked for a shorter cut but she didn't really listen to what I asked for. She cut my hair short and didn't say anything about it. She didn't offer to wash it. I asked for a dry shampoo and blow dry it, she told me to wash it. When I left with wet it wet it wet it all wet. I was cold. I went back in the dry it. I still wet it wet it wet wet. I had to wash it wet my wet. I washed it wet it wet it wet"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Listen to the reviews. This place is bad. I only came here because I was already at Trader Joe's anyways. 

The pedicure - the older woman who did my pedicure was sloppy. Polish all over my toes that I had to direct her to wipe off. It makes me cringe to tell someone how to do their job, but at the prices of this place you would expect some better service. She barely scrubbed my foot which I had paid extra for. This wasn't a basic pedicure, y'all. I had to touch the rough spots on my heels (my love of stilettos is dangerous) and show her that it wasn't done. 

The mani - this man who did my manicure was so proud when he was finished. He did a GEL MANICURE in 15 minutes. You know who does it that fast? Mr. Miyagi and a bad technician. They just can't be done that quickly. The polish pools in corners, dries heavy, and ends up looking chunky instead of thin and streamlined. Yeah, I'm particular about a good gel polish because they're costly - and when done right - last much longer than simple polish. So I was critical. I nitpicked. Sue me. He rewarded that by not helping me pick my bags or shoes up as I made my way to the dryer and choosing to help some other woman. AND THAT'S FINE. That woman must have loved her mediocre nails and I firmly believing in helping those who clearly cannot help themselves. 

Oh and they only accept cash tips, but there's no sign to indicate that. Who cares anyways, this place is so inefficient that requiring a sign would have been out of character."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"Not perfect! I made an appointment for 3:30 and was told they close at 3:30. I waited for the nail technician to finish and then the tech told me it was fine that it was. I waited for 30 minutes before they finally started my nails. I was very disappointed with the service. I was also disappointed with the massage part. I was told the tech had already left and was charged $10 for a massage and an additional $10 for a pedicure. I was very disappointed with my service and will not be going back.I was a regular here for a few years, and have had good experiences at other salons in the area.  I had a bad experience at another salon, and my hair looked horrible.  I was scheduled for a color and cut, and my hair turned out pretty bad.  I'm happy to say I didn't have to pay for that because I was happy with my hair.  I was told to wash my hair before leaving, and that the color would be darker than the cut.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Checked in for 11 year anniversary. Supposed to be special. Turned out to be a nightmare. I should have know when someone called and confirmed the reservation and they were so rude.

First thing, we got a suite nonsmoking, showed up the room was definitely smoking, it was disgusting. And I mean disgusting. Dirty toilet, tons of hair and grime in the spa tub, sticky stuff on floor, horrible view of a roof, and stained sheets and bedding. Remind u this is supposed to be a suite.

I ordered champagne and strawberries upon arrival. The champagne and 6 berries was $65. Berries were disgusting and old champagne was hot. 

I am not a complainer and would have sucked it out and moved on but my husband was pissed. I called front desk and the moved us rooms. It was a down grade to a regular room, not a suite, but it was clean and nonsmoking. They didn't offer to reimburse the difference.  When asked why the front desk attendant was extremely rude and disrespectful.  The walls were paper thin and I could basically hear everything my neighbor was doing. The shower was nice! The pool was fun and clean for the most part. They were on u heavy about masks which is understandable. 

We ordered room services and it was horrific. Ordered drinks by the pool, they were also disgusting. Thankfully we had dinner reservations at Atlantis which saved our date night. 

Gambling wise we didn't win or see anyone winning at Peppermill but definitely did at Atlantis. We spent a lot and didn't get a single free drink which was weird. I will be going back to Reno but obviously giving a different hotel my money!"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,I normally cut the Boys hair. The guys are friendly but it's always a challenge to find a hair stylist that can cut your hair and get the job done. The guys are nice but the shop is not in good shape. I had an appointment with Sara for a balayage and a cut. I was the only client in the salon and didn't have an appointment. Sara did my hair and did a fantastic job! She listened to what I wanted and made suggestions for what would look best on my hair. I have curly hair and she did an amazing job! I'm so glad I found her. I have been going to Sara for almost 10 years now. I'll be going to her for years!I went to see Mary for my first Brazilian and she was awesome! She explained the process and the process. I have no complaints about her. I will definitely be back!I've been coming to this nail salon for a few months now. I've gotten a full set and pedicure. The staff are very friendly and the prices are reasonable. The service is great. I got a manicure and pedicure. They have a gel manicure with regular manicure with gel manicure. I got a pedicure. I got a gel manicure. It lasted almost 2 weeks before and this is on my toes. I got acrylic. The pedicure and my nails peeled off.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"If you haven't tried Reiki, go see Tia! She is a true professional, intuitive massage therapist. I had an excellent experience at this salon. The staff was friendly and accommodating. My stylist was Alyssa. She took her time and listened to what I wanted. The salon is clean and comfortable. I highly recommend it. I had a horrible experience with a Groupon deal. I called ahead to make an appointment for my daughter. The girl who answered the phone was very sweet and did a great job. The place is very small, but they have a nice selection of colors and services. I would definitely go back if I lived in the area. I went in for a full set of acrylics and I was satisfied. The lady who did my nails was very sweet and did a great job! I'll definitely be back!Great place to get your nails done. I go here all the time and have never had a bad experience. I usually go to this place but I went in today and the guy who did my nails was rough and I had to bleed. I was bleeding twice. My nails were bleeding and he was bleeding for about a couple of times. He tried to the entire time. I was bleeding twice. He said he also got up and down the entire time. He was bleeding. I had to bleed on my finger. I left bleeding. I was bleeding."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"So I used a tech others recommended on yelp, Nina. She was nice enough and my very first time she did a great job, had manicure. The second time I went for pedicure and manicure. I had to wait 20 mins, I had appointment. Then she came over with same instruments from previous client. She went to the kitchen so I thought when she came back maybe she would grab new instruments, but obviously no because before she starts she used some kind of spray on them and wiped them off. Shame on me for not stopping her but when I asked if they are sterile the condescending tone implied I was stupid for asking this question. 

Then when she cut my toe nails she went deep down on the side at such an angle it hurt, she said it makes for a better looking manicure. I had a sore toe for a few days but thankfully no infection.

After I moved for my manicure. She used a rough buffer on my nails, I am guessing they were out of the old ones because I asked her and she said oh it is only light buff I am not pressing hard, well I now have a lot of deep scratches on my nails thanks to her!

Finally, if all of that was not bad enough, I went over to dryer and there was a dead cockroach by the wall. I know they are sandwiched next to a restaurant but according to the reviews this place was clean. Not to mention all the dust and tumbleweed size dust bunnies behind the chair.

Beware ladies of this one, save your time, money and possible infection!!!!

I will be filing a complaint on this shop."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"Had my first facial there today using a Groupon. It is located in a large local shopping area so there was plenty as I had a daytime appointment.

I arrived 15 minutes before my appointment and was immediately greeted at the reception desk and provided them with my Groupon. She informed me that the Groupon did not cover tax and that would have to be paid at the completion of services but it was only a couple of dollars so no big deal.

The entry area is sparsely decorated nothing fancy and a few chairs for waiting but I didn't have to wait long before I was called in for my appointment.

The room was sufficiently equipped again nothing fancy. One item to be aware of is that the walls don't go all the way up to the ceiling so whether you're getting a facial or a massage you will hear a noise from people in the hallway and in the reception area. So it's not a completely relaxing environment.

It would've been nice to have a warm bed as it got a bit chilly throughout the service. The facial was good and I paid for the collagen upgrade. They were a couple of areas that I expected that she would exfoliate or do extractions but she didn't. The facial massage was very good along with the head and neck massage.
It was supposed to be an organic facial and I don't know if the products were necessarily organic.

Overall I'd say it was not great and it wasn't awful. For the $40 I paid for the Groupon it was a decent facial. I don't know that I would rush back again as there's other places in the area I would like to try."

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I advise all to stay away from this place. Customer service is horrible and the entire place needs a deep cleaning. At first glance it looks like a pretty nice establishment but if you look at details you can see how dirty and unkept it really is. Towards the end of getting my toes done a ROACH fell on my arm. I freaked out and slapped it off of me and it fell into the water. My technician acted like it was normal and just took the bug out and placed it on the floor. I asked her if she was going to kill it but she just left it there saying it would go away. I was so uncomfortable and I would of got up and left but I already had started the process of having gel polish on my toes so I decided to just let her finish. Before she could finish painting ANOTHER bug crawled on me!Although it was just a love bug this time, it didn't matter because I was already spooked from the roach. Once she was done I asked to speak with a manager and was told she was not there. So a man approached and I explained to him my situation his response was ""it's just a bug"". I told him that I will need some kind of compensation because I couldn't even finish the rest of my pedicure. He became upset as if I was in the wrong and stated he will only give me $5 off. 

The lady that did my nails was so sweet and innocent I wish I got her name but I did tip her well like I always do because I know it wasn't her fault."

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"So in the past my review would have been ok or good. BUT I just found out that my child who I recommended your office to go see. He went to you for assistance you all gave him some cream and made him wait around for 2 hours and $300 later sent him on his way. Basically you forgot him!!  
You guys gave him some cream and diagnosed  as some unknown eczema. He has had the condition at that point for almost 3 months. 

Well upon moving out of state they diagnosed The so-called unknown issue immediately at a CVS minute freeking clinic!! after 2 minutes of looking at it!!  What was it??  Scabies. Gross scabies he picked up somewhere in his travels.  They gave him the prescribed treatment and amazingly it's fully gone. 

All I can assume is that you guys got your degrees out of gumball machines it's easily diagnosable, not for him -- he's no Dr,  that's what he's paying you to do but you guys are a joke. 
I would say for anybody who's coming to see you unless it's for maybe Diggin some skin cancer out of you they need to run away from you. You guys do not know what you're doing!!  Big step from some unknown eczema to actual bugs good Lord!!  He Had to live with that condition for almost 5 months until he found a real doctor. They evidently focus on medicine versus how much money they could make off of him. 
So are you guys actually in it for helping folks or are you actually just there to make a few bucks off of people and send them on their way??!! Unreal."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"THIS PLACE IS A DISASTER. 

I paid $45 for a simple gel manicure and pedicure.  The technician was very nice and the manicure was great.  The color selection was limited and the cuticles were very short.  I don't know how this place gets a 2 star because I didn't get a hot stone massage on my hands.  I will say I went with a friend and I am not sure if I will be back.  The salon was very clean and my nails look great.  I will definitely be back.  I was a little concerned about the price of the manicure because it was only $25 which is a lot more than I normally pay at a nail salon.I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I asked for a little longer but she cut the length of my hair shorter than the length I wanted. When I went to pay the lady who did my hair was very rough with my hair. She cut my hair way too short, but was very rough with the cut. The cut was bad. I have been getting my hair cut by two other places that would have left with a lot of hair sticking out of my head and then have been cut my hair. I got cut down and it cut. It was uneven. My hair cut way too short and then cut too short. It was too short. The color and choppy."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I was looking forward to getting back to a new haircut after going GREEN for COVID Pandemic. I approached the shop and just as I was about to enter an employee was walking out at the same time. She asked me if she could help me in a customer service sorta friendly way while holding the door preventing me from going in. I told her I was there for a haircut (Monday mid-afternoon). She asked, ""Do you have an appointment?"" I said, ""No, I did not. I didn't know I had too!"" She said, ""You absolutely have to have an appointment with this virus going around!"" ""And it takes months to get in here too!"" Said in a real wise-ass way as if I was ignorant to the world conditions. Just as I said, ""I guess I can't get a haircut!"" someone inside (an employee) laughed at me saying, ""You're a fool if you're coming in here without an appointment!"" Absolutely no one was around. They were all sitting around chatting up a storm. I just walked away in absolute disgust. Amazed by their juvenile behavior towards me. 

Now, thinking about how many times I have solicited this establishment for over ten years, yes 10+ years. Let me think, every other month equals 6 times a year, times ten years.....plus all the tips, recommendations and nice things I have said to many different people in my life looking for good hair-cutters. It doesn't add-up. 

You now just lost a long time customer for life! Your spontaneous outburst, lack of professionalism and unwillingness to recognize a longtime customer leaves me with the impression you should close your shop, lay-off everyone and rebrand because you are not the shop you used to be!"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Linda did my pedicure. Nice lady. Rough on the touch. I'm alive and still feel... She is detail and attentive though. She asked me what pedicure I wanted with the menu so I could see what each one included. I chose the Allure spa pedi, I like the sugar scrub. Nice decor but I still felt the small shop feel in a way. They were not too busy even though everyone was working with a customer. 

Walk-ins are welcome as I didn't have an appointment and they received me and service me within 15 minutes from walking through the door. I was seated on a pedi chair with in 5 minutes after choosing my color. She offered me water, wine or sprite to drink. 

The pedicure was good apart from the tab roughness, a more ""sensitive"" customer would of not like it. She did a great job on the scrub and the massage! 5 stars for those. 

I can see why it still on the 3 stars level though. It does have a 5 start look but service needs to improve with it. And it's not much really. They are attentive and welcoming when you walk it, it's mainly lack of communication on the customer service scale. I would like to be able to communicate what I want done with details so it's done right. 

Tonny did my acrylics. Well, everything started good. I showed him a picture and he didn't deliver. I feel I have play-doo stuckon my nails. My fingers hurt as they are glued all around the edges and he tried to un-glued them but pushing and that made my skin ripped. Ouch! 

Ps: I still don't get why they polish your nails before putting the little flip flops..."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"It pains me to do this because this place used to be ""my"" place for nails and eyebrow waxing. But I've gotta tell y'all a nasty little story that has changed my mind forever. At my last visit I was a walk-in client & just wanted an eyebrow wax. The place was very busy so I didn't mind waiting a bit. but I'm pretty sure they forgot I was just there for a waxing (and not a full mani/pedi) because they left me waiting for 45 minutes (a waxing takes about 5 minutes - so usually they'll get you in & out). During my wait-time, I was talking to my husband on the phone and he ended up coming by to bring me a soda. When he walked in, it must have dawned on the staff how long I'd been waiting, so a woman jumped right up from doing a pedicure and ran over, ushering me into the waxing room. I'm laying there on the table thinking, ""she's going to wash her hands, right?""
but no. No she did not. She just started waxing. And touching my face. With the same hands she'd just had all up over someone else's feet. I don't know why I didn't say something - I felt really uncomfortable about the whole thing, but I've always loved this place (been a loyal customer for 3 years) and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Forgetting about me and making me wait 45 minutes for an eyebrow wax is forgivable. It's annoying, but I could look past it one time. Touching my face immediately after handling someone's feet without washing your hands in between is absolutely NOT something I can get past. I'm sorry to say - but I will NEVER, EVER be back."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,This was my first visit here. The woman who did my pedicure did a great job. She took her time and did a great job. The salon is clean and very relaxing. I will definitely come back. I'm a loyal customer for years and always receive great service. I always get a great haircut at the same time. I've had 3 different barbers there and have had a great cut each time. The last one I tried was very rushed. The guy who cut my hair did not seem to know what he was doing. I was just in a rush to get out of there so that was fine. I've had my hair cut in the past and I've never been to a barber shop where you're treated like a child. I will not be coming here again. I have been going to this place since I moved to Tampa from California. I have always had a great experience. I have been to several different nail salons in St. Louis and this is the best one I have been to. My nails always look great! I always get a gel mani and pedi and I always leave happy with the color. I never leave there feeling like a new girl!I'm new to try to write a new place and maybe I'm a new place in the new stylist and found my new one. I've never been to go there. So happy.
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"Dolce and Appreciate You - I love them both. And let's not forget Miranda!

Appreciate You has such a warm and friendly vibe (which other nail salons in this area don't which is how I found Dolce - looking for a place to take my poor nails where I'd feel comfortable and happy.)Her shop is extremely clean and well tended. I go to Appreciate You exclusively, as do both my daughters.

i wanted to add that although my feet are not my best feature, I'm complimented on my pedicure colors too many times too count. And ten years ago, I was afraid to get a pedicure because I thought my feet were too ugly. Under the care of Dolce and Miranda, they are now pieds de beaute!

I garden a lot and i seldom wear gloves. Plus I didnt drink milk as a kid and my fingernails have always shredded,weak and crummy. So I don't get a lot of manicures. But the manicures I've had (Dolce) and a nail product she recommended and staying out of my garden for the summer (doctor's orders) have given me,for the first time in my life, actual finger nails that will grow to a decent length without cracking or splitting and hands, previously kind of an eyesore, that look very presentable. For me, that's a tremendous achievement- one that i've never been able to make on my own in spite of years of drinking gelatin and spending many $ on Sally Hansen products.

Dolce will also wax, but you HAVE to book that in advance.

Anyway, Appreciate You is one of my Happy Places (and i don't have a lot of those ) and Dolce and Miranda are two of my favorite people (and I don't have a lot of those either‍)"

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I had an augmentation in December 2015 by another surgeon and was unhappy with my results. I knew I wanted a revision but was anxious about something going wrong again and about the financial burden so I waited years before deciding to fix it. I first met with Dr. Chapin in April 2019 after seeing 3 other surgeons. When I met him I knew that he was the best I'd get and I canceled all other consultations I had scheduled and decided to move forward with him. He explained everything in great detail and his confidence and knowledge made me sure he'd give me the results I wanted. Being someone with anxiety I know that I can be difficult for some people with my many questions, concerns, and need for detailed explanations but Dr. Chapin never made me feel like a nuisance. He offered detailed explanations and made me feel like he was happy to spend the extra time with me to ensure I felt at ease with the surgery. I never felt rushed or brushed off. One example is the pre-op appointment. My husband came with me and we brought a big list of questions. My husband was asking them and checking them off as he answered. When he asked if there's anything else my husband said no but Dr. Chapin saw things not crossed off and asked about them. Another doctor would have been happy with the answer no and left but Dr. Chapin is a perfectionist not only in his work but in his attention to his patients' emotional well being. My surgery was successful and I am so happy with my results. Thank you to Dr. Chapin and the entire Chapin Aesthetic team for your help through the entire journey!"

Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"These reviews are hilariously bad and possibly written by ill-tempered and impatient people, lol.
I just finished my 6th appointment here and I really like this office.  As a person on permanent disability my healthcare options are limited.  I read the reviews posted here and decided to give them a try anyway.  The reviews amount to wait times (they take emergency patients so yeah, sometimes you are gonna wait.  I'm certain if you had time constraints and discussed it with the staff before hand they'd be happy to work something out) And I'm so glad I did.
My condition requires me to take medication that causes nutritional deficiencies and dry mouth- huge contributors to declining dental health.  I needed a lot of major work done and I'm very happy with the results.
The office, waiting and examination rooms are all very well maintained.  I like the appointment reminder system and the accessibility of the office staff and dentist.  I love my hygienist, I've her seen twice, she is very gentle and has small hands-- bonus in my book.  I've seen 4 different dentists in this office and am pleased with all of them.  My experience with the staff has always been pleasant and flexible in regards to my personal needs.
I'm also extremely grateful for this practice.  I don't know if this is by design or just happens to be this way but the staff is mostly women, multicultural and multilingual. They take Medicaid/Medicare.  It's very progressive.  They care about their patients, the quality of work they give and are meeting needs of the community that most offices ignore.  I've never found myself waiting very long but if I did, it would totally be worth it."

Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I discovered Bungalow Organic Spa while searching for organic facials near Philadelphia. I was able to book a ""Balancing Facial"" online using their scheduling app (A+ for ease of use.)

The spa is conveniently located on a side street in Ambler with a free parking lot behind the building. When you come in for your appointment, you're greeted by an ethereal looking Esthetician with a welcoming smile. The owner Lindsay clearly knows what she's doing because her skin is flawless.

After completing some paperwork, you're presented with a flower and ""meditation of the day"" card which sets the tone for the best facial you'll ever receive. Following a setting of intention, you're escorted into a beautifully decorated room with soft shades of gray and white, crystals lining the walls and an exquisitely fluffy rug that feels incredible on bare feet.

The table is thankfully heated, which is wonderful this time of year. Lindsay welcomes dialogue, or she'll quietly work her magic while you relax. This isn't an ordinary facial with abrasive scrubs, painful extractions and bright lights...it's a skin pampering multi-hour experience complete with food derived masks, steaming, soft music, crystals, quartz rollers, scalp massage, oils, LED treatment and singing bowls.

Just when you think all the magic has ended and you brave yourself to enter the ""real world,"" Lindsay is in the lobby with a hot mug of tea and bliss balls. You're encouraged to relax for a moment and leave when you're ready.

Sure, these facials are pricier than your average spa, but they also come with healing energy and your skin will thank you. I'm still combatting cystic acne brought on by raging pregnancy hormones, but Bungalow Organic Spa is there to help pamper this tired mama so I too can feel like a Goddess for a moment."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"I have wavy hair, and there are a few things I'd come to accept as gospel when it came to my hair. One-when getting a haircut, I had to choose between one that would work with me wearing my hair curly, or one that would work for wearing my hair straight. Two-I had 3 hair options for day two: ponytail, bun or clip. Three-decent morning bed head was just not possible. And four-letting my hair air dry was a ticket to self-inflicted house arrest. My hair took work to make it look ok. Now, I've had numerous haircuts, from in-home stylists to high end salons, and have had three different types of outcomes: hated it at the stylist's and hated it at home, loved it at the stylist's and hated it at home, loved it at the stylist's and loved it at home but it still took work for me to style it. Getting the right haircut always took many visits and lots of tweaking to achieve. Angela has changed ALL that for me. She cut my hair last week, and I've put it through its paces. I AM TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THIS HAIRCUT! Scrunch blow dried it curly-loved it! Flat ironed it-perfect! Let it dry by itself-stylish no-effort beach waves! Woken up in the morning with my hair ready to go and I LOVE IT! This is hands-down the best cut I've ever had. Angela is a total rock star! She said she likes to tailor each person's cut to be completely unique to them, according to what will work best for your hair, and I saw that as she was cutting. She was totally focused and kept working until she was happy with it. I've found my hair place and couldn't be happier!"

The gentleman who did my nails was super sweet and did a great job! My toes look great and I will definitely be back. However, my polish chipped and peeling within a week. I don't know if that was due to the work but I would definitely recommend this place. I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I asked for a little longer but she cut the length of my hair shorter than the rest and gave me a very short bob that looks like I had a bald spot on my head. I also asked for a little more length off, but was charged $60 for it. The cut was $60 which is not bad, $80, the hair cut was $60 and I was charged $60. I asked for the price was charged $50.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Talented Nail Tech (Kim) is the the owner of a terrible, unprofessional,
 mess of a salon. I agree with previous reviews. Since I live across the street, I gave it a try and was lucky to have Kim work on my nails the first time. The next time, a terrible tech cut me and left me with sloppy nails. When I tried to complain it was lost in translation. The staff traded off with up to 4 people working on my hands and feet. I was tired of explaining. I quickly learned if I want good nails, wait for Kim. She's friendly and funny but can't seem to hire good help. Since I'm charged the same whether she does them or not I make an appointment with her. Why a 1 star rating after such beautiful nails the last time? She's cancelled my appointment for the last THREE times. Each time, they waited until I come in to the shop in order to tell me she won't be in (although I left my number). As though I wouldn't mind if someone else just subbed in. Trying not to be rude, I'd politely decline and make a new appointment when I really wanted to say ""NO! You do a HORRIBLE job"". As i turned to walk out of the salon after Kim no showed once more without notice, I decided my time and money are worth more than this horrible experience. I'm the mother of a newborn with little time out of the house. I drove RIGHT PAST this salon to Luxecare Nails where Harrison, the owner, knows how treat his customers. Also, you may want to ask all of the writers of 5 star reviews for this salon how they enjoyed the discount on their next visit."

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Well I did my 2 day stay. And yuppp. Thanks to Ellen. I got to go to the Miraval experience. 

Really what sent this place down In status is it tries to be so superior to other resorts. Upon checking in I asked the clerk if there were any upgrades. He said yes that for 50$ additional I could get a room by a water fountain. I thought this would be cool, so I accepted. Now he did tell me it wasn't ready but that i could wait. No problem. 2 hours went bye as I toured the resort and like I was told to do I called from the resorts white phones and was told by a check in clerk. Room was ready. I went to Check in desk and when arriving was told "" sorry mistake, it's not ready yet"". So I just said fine give me original room u were gonna put me in. They said ok. I asked would u call me once the fountain area room was ready and I can move Into it. I was told "" well housekeeping doesn't like to do that"" ok does housekeeping run the service dept? Not like I was gonna dirty my room so badly. In a good service industry they should have had my upgrade room cleaned and had me in it. If not ready call me and I can move Into it later. No attention to detail

Many people here were great. Scott at restaurant. Lady that is hostess at restaraunt was great also. Point is, though it was a ellen trip I would never pay the prices they ask for the services offered. Food was good
Massages were great. But would the amount of money compare to the quality of service. No in my opinion."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"Lavender nails is the ghetto by far! I had a horrible experience with Huyen! She is fast and sloppy and kept telling me what she wanted to do or what she thought needed to be done to my nails instead of what i TOLD her to do. Her suggestions weren't from a place of professionalism either but laziness. I asked to soak off my acrylic and she insisted i get a fill in until i told her that i feel it's best to soak off and i wanted gel polish instead. She finally did start the soak off process eventually  revealing two nails that developed fungus underneath the acrylic i had only had about 3-4 weeks (that was also done there). I don't get fungus at any other nail shop. She also ended up knicking my thumb cuticle as she was drilling off the acrylic and i had to ask HER to get the green sterile droplets, to which she replied ""I'll get it later"" no you get it NOW! That's unsanitary !!. She also kept also saying just leave it like that , leave it like that if i complained about her filing being uneven or noticed a nail needed a little more trimming ... When removing my toe nail polish she left the residue from the polish she removed all over my toes. She was nasty as well i saw her touch things, scratch her hair and face without sanitizing her hands prior to resuming work on nails. It's always ridiculously busy, they barely take appointments and now will be closing on Sundays. Prices also in my opinion are ridiculous for the service. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Not to mention i had to come back less than two days later, because my GEL polish was already chipping."

Beauty & Spas,2.0,OR,"NEVER AGAIN!!!!!1

I went to this salon a couple of times prior to the covid quarantine.  At that time I was really happy with my nails.  I returned last week to have a refill and pedicure.  I also had my eyebrows and upper lip waxed.

Where to begin?  First, the woman who did my nails decided to cut down all my toenails without asking me.  She cut them so short that they looked hideous.  Because of this, I wanted tips and acrylic on the big toes to try to make them presentable enough to polish.   I asked her for tips and she didn't understand me.  Another girl had to translate.  The woman doing my nails decided she was going to sculpt instead.  I didn't want this because there is a lot of pressure on the nails when shoes are worn and I was afraid the acrylic would rip off.  Well, yesterday it did rip off leaving me with an even shorter nail and a wound on my nail bed that bled like crazy.  (see pic)  Additionally, I paid for a spa pedicure which included longer massage time....I'm sure you can guess that she barely massaged my feet at all.

When she moved onto my hands, she repeatedly burned me with the sander and did not fully cover my nails with acrylic.  The polish was also applied slopily.

Lastly, eyebrows and lip wax.  Well when I got home I had to tweeze all the hair that she missed on my eyebrows.

I have never given anyone a bad review but the poor service I received at this salon was too much not to warn others.

Please note, in the picture of my toe, the dark stuff isn't dirt, it's dried blood."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I visited this place for a Brazilian that I had purchased through a Groupon offer. 

Because salons keep recommending that waxing touch ups should be done at least once a month, I scheduled my appointment a month after an upcoming appointment at another salon. Considering how often salons suggest making monthly appointments, you would imagine that the salon wouldn't have a problem with scheduling the appointment. When I arrived there on my scheduled date, I was turned away and rescheduled for the next available date about 2-4 weeks later (thus, pushing me back from the month-to-month touch ups), because they had made a mistake in scheduling me. It was close to the Groupon expiration date, so I'm glad they were willing to accept it. I wasn't glad making the trip out to South St. for nothing.

On wax day, they were friendly, offered me water, and were willing to help save a nearby spot for me as I moved my car from a spot that had a broken meter. The woman who waxed me was conversational and friendly which is a plus. The place smelled great like peaches--hence the name of the salon. I liked that they had wipes to sanitize yourself before the ""procedure"" (for lack of a better word).

What left me disappointed was at the end. There were a lot of hairs that the wax couldn't pick up; the woman worked to tweeze them out. When she was done, she said I was clean, all good to go, and that any stray hairs still on me were hairs that were pulled out. She walked out as I got myself ready to go. When I checked myself, there were still a decent number of strays (more than a few) that were still rooted to my skin--as in not completely pulled out."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This spa is fantastic! First, I did some paperwork and the front desk assistant offered me lemon water, m&ms, or jelly beans. It is beautifully decorated and an inviting space. After my paperwork, I was taken back to the relaxation room. Omg! It was amazing. I had a warm neck wrap on and I was offered cookies and hot tea. It has a gas fireplace with dragon glass along the wall and cushy chairs. It was toasty but not too warm. It was literally the perfect temperature. I had a lash lift and tint done with Ann. This was my first experience with a lash lift, and Ann was fantastic. She walked me through the whole process and explained what she was doing as we went along. I had a few moments where the tint dye stung, but she took care of me immediately to flush my eye out. This is all normal and very common, but she addressed the discomfort immediately. She's incredibly kind. She made sure the table was warm and toasty as a lash lift isn't a relaxing spa experience. It's not uncomfortable but it's super awkward and you have a super bright light in your face the whole time. I am very pleased with the service. Ann sent me home with spoolies tied up in a glove to comb my lashes out and after care instructions. My lashes look amazing! This place isn't much more than other salons and includes a tint! I personally won't get a tint again mainly because my lashes are very dark as my hair color is almost black naturally, so colors don't show up on me unless my hair is lightened. While this spa isn't cheap, you get what you pay for. It was more than just a service but a whole experience."

And, besides, the mall location used a ""gun"" which was far, far more painful than the needle piercing Robo did when I went there for a badly needed fix-it procedure.

He fixed everything for me and now, a week later, all is healing well and I am thankful I found a true professional to make the corrections.

You get what you pay for and Piercing Pagoda was free (if you bought the earrings) and Robo charged $20 for one ear or $30 for 2 ears, and used my existing earrings.

What a difference! Now I don't need to do a downward angle to put a post in my ear lobes and the earrings I do put in are now (finally) in close proximity to each other on either side of my face.  It's a small thing, I guess, but when we go through the process, don't we all want to have the holes where they should be?  It really makes a difference we see every day as we put new earrings in our ears.

Thank you Robo, you were worth every penny I paid and I regret I didn't do my homework in advance to know (1) the piercing gun was the wrong way to proceed and (2) a tattoo parlor does these things the right way."

There is a large one- size two-story open front, a small bathroom, and a huge flat screen tv that you can watch while you wait. I've been there for years and always had great service. I always get a great haircut, and I always feel safe here. All the staff is really nice. I just went there to get a haircut and the guy who cut my hair was very nice. He was very friendly, and made me feel comfortable. I'll definitely be back.I just moved to Tucson from California and have been looking for a place to get my nails done. I came across this place on yelp and I'm so glad I did! They have a large selection of nail polish, gel and regular polish, and are super nice! I got a full set of gel nails and a pedicure. The lady who did my nails was very nice and took her time. My nails are perfect and the pedicure was very relaxing! She even took her time! I will definitely be back!I've been to this place twice now and have not been to have never been satisfied. The first time but I have been here twice and had a great experience. The first time. The first time I got my hair cut and color and cut and color and cut was done by the second time and a cut. My hair was done by Tony did a half off. I got charged me."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"So I have been going to this salon for almost two years now. I recently had my hair done before headed to Europe on vacation. My highlights that were done were a disgrace to all hairdresser kind. I paid my regular $240 for A full head of highlights and a cut with toner, and it turned out like something out of a box or something that was done by a new trainee in beauty school. Possibly worse. Not one spot on my entire head had highlights to my scalp. It looked like I hadn't gotten my hair done in 3-4 months and looked brassy and orange. I took pictures of my hair the first time I washed it four days after it was done and will attach here. I took these pictures because I was disgusted while trying to blow dry and flat iron my hair and seeing it in detail. The zebra stripes, the horrible color and demarcation of multiple colors even though I paid for a toner on my hair also. My roots were inches long and I felt like trailer park trash headed out to Europe with no time to get it redone not to mention putting more bleach on my hair and causing more damage. I emailed the salon and have yet to hear anything from them and it is going on over a month since I reached out to them. To me this is beyond unacceptable. I learned at my appointment that my hairdresser was actually one of the managers. I suppose that is why I have heard nothing from them to rectify the issue and make things right with either a refund or having my hair redone by someone else. I am disgusted by the lack of professionalism displayed by this company to a long term customer."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This appointment was the second time I had ever had a pedicure done, I was just in a rush. The technician was very nice and the atmosphere was nice. The massage chairs were comfy and the paint job was good. My technician was excellent. The only thing I would change is the massage chair, which was great. I think the polish job was poor. I paid $25 for a pedicure and $30 for a gel manicure. I would not recommend this place. I will definitely not be returning. I had a great experience here! They were so accommodating and kind. I was not only happy with the results, but I also felt at ease and relaxed. I can't wait to go back! Thanks again!I was in town for work and decided to treat myself to a day at the spa. I was on a trip and decided to treat myself to a pedicure. The nail tech that I had was very nice and did a great job. She was very thorough and paid attention to detail.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I had planned a girls day out for a friend of mine and I the week before she was due to be induced for her second daughter.  I thought that this ""reputable"" Day Spa would be a great way to treat her to a prenatal massage.  I booked a week in advance and was told on the phone as well as read online that clients are asked to arrive AT LEAST 15 minutes prior to their appointments. This early arrival is requested so that you may get paperwork completed, change clothes and enjoy time in the quiet room to unwind and relax. We each had an appointment for 9:00 am on a Friday, one deep tissue and one prenatal.  We arrived by taxi at 8:45am, only to find the spa still closed and no employees inside.  The first employee arrived around 9:05 and then showed us to the changing room.  The shower drain had a mass of hair in it from the previous day, trashcans were over flowing onto the bathroom floor, and wilted (once pretty) flowers sat in vases along the vanity counter.  Once dressed, we made our way to the quiet room.  The receptionist then came in at 9:15 and said that one of our massuses was running a few minutes late.  We kept quiet and figured we'd give her the benefit of the doubt... traffic, rough morning, sick child maybe. To make this short... our massages both were cut short due to spa not being prepared for business and not having their employees arrive on time.   The lady who performed the prenatal massage smelt of an ashtray, I cannot imagine being 38 weeks pregnant and trying to enjoy a service being paid for all while breathing in stale nicotine ridden air."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"I booked a ""Spa-rty"" here for a wedding with my sister.

The staff was friendly and we had a great conversation. The room was very clean, and the lobby was very large.

I was very pleased with the results. I am looking forward to getting a facial next week!I've been to this nail salon a couple of times. I'm not sure why I just went in today. The man doing my pedicure was super nice and did a great job. I'll be going back.I got a gel manicure and it was only $30. I had a gel manicure and a regular pedicure. The lady who did my nails did a really good job, but the woman that did my nails didn't do a good job. She didn't file my nails and the edges of my nails weren't filed down evenly. I had toenails that needed a little filing so she did not buffing them and was very rough and I had toenails that needed to be cut and then had toenails on my fingers bleeding. I paid $60. It was really asked for my nail tip and tipped $60. I tipped her $60. She didn't tip and tipped her $60. I tipped her and it was charged me $60"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"This review is long overdue. I've been getting lash extensions from Jenny Drew for over a year and a half now, non-stop, every two weeks. 

Now I've always had very short and thin lashes. So I've resorted to glue on lash extensions and have seen a few lash extension artists in the past. Before I met Jenny, I never really felt too invested on making my lash appointments a priority. 

Ever since I started seeing her, I look forward to every future appointment. She's literally so down to earth and always makes me laugh. She is truly one of the sweetest humans you'll ever meet and you know that all of her other clients think the same because whether you're coming in for your appointment or just leaving, her clients are always coming in and leaving with a smile. 

Now about her craft. Jenny continues to grow in her artistry by attending lash certification classes and encourages her team to do the same. She makes sure to always ask how my lashes are doing because she truly cares! If something isn't working, whether it be the glue, or the lash material itself, she'll try her best to find a solution for you! She has helped me achieve my dream lashes by building off of the lashes she adds on. Although it has taken some time and patience, that's the best and safest way to go!

Lash Envy has a cute location in The Basement which also has other sweet shops that you guys should definitely check out. 

Jenny has acquired some talented artists as well (Nichole and Crystal) that do amazing work! So go check them out and give them some love!

Thank you Jenny Drew and the Lash Envy team for making all the little ladies that come to your shop feel beautiful every single day!"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I was treated here today by an amazing woman named Nancy. She did a wonderful job and was so sweet. The place is clean and modern, and the staff is very friendly. They had a great selection of nail polishes and even if I didn't have an appointment I could get in without an appointment. I will definitely be back!I went here for the first time today and had a great experience. I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure and they were able to squeeze me in. I've never been to a salon where I was rushed and the tech didn't seem like she was going to be there. I'm not a fan of that. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. They were nice but the mani/pedi was a little sloppy. I guess I was paying for a basic pedicure and the lady doing my nails was rushing and was rushing. I've never had a pedicure that was rushed and not very clean. The guy doing my nails was very rough and I had to bleed. I was bleeding a lot. It was not bleeding. I will not be going back. I have never go back to this place again.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Let me start by saying the Aveda products are exceptional and the students are dedicated and committed to their craft. I've received services in the University City School at least 4-5 times over the last 2 months or so. I was so pleased I took my elderly mother as well as having an appointment for myself. The student accidentally allowed water from the wash bowl to spill down my mothers back. Her two shirts, sweater and the top of her jeans were soaked. The student was apologetic and was helpful in getting my mother as dry and warm as possible. I asked to speak to the manager about the situation and she made me wait almost an hour before she would come talk to me, she initially said there was nothing she could do because it's a school and we signed a waiver. I was simply looking for some empathy and an adjustment on the bill. After heated discussion she snatched the bill from me and told me not to come back (implying if I did something bad might happen to me). I asked why the school was no longer the place for me to come, explained I run two small businesses and why customer service is of the utmost importance. The manager/director called the cops on me. I waited to hear her explanation and talk to the officer for myself. She slinked away with a sulky attitude. He said this was a customer service issue and she should have never called. The manager/director is angry, ignorant and a poor model for customer service. I hope all the students will exponentially exceed the poor customer standard exhibited today. Also, the director was unwilling to give any higher management information explaining she was the highest level. It is an independently owned franchised but the key is 'owned."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,"It would be unfair to say that the quality of work is not consistent, and the customer service is poor. I had a friend who was also in the shop, and it was his first tattoo. I told him that I wanted a tattoo and he said he could do it. He said no. I told him I wanted it redone and he said it would be $60. I agreed to that. When I got there, he was very friendly and told me to go sit down. He then showed me a piece of work he had done on my friend, and I said that it was not what I wanted, and he was doing it too. I said to him that I wanted it redone and that I wanted to make sure he would fix it. I said it was ok, and he said that the design I wanted was not what I wanted. I said I wanted to have it redone, and he said that I would have to pay for the original design. He said that was fine, but he didn't do anything for me. I asked him to take it off, and he said ""did it, I want it redone"". I said it redone, and he said that is not redone. "" He said he said that's not redone"". I said that's not redone. He said ""got it redone. "" I didn't get the one of my tattoo. So I said no, I'll do it redone, but he said no redone."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been coming to this spa for several things. First waxing, and basically now for all of my needs. 

After trying to give a local pedicure/manicure several tries, and not having the results I wanted, I gave Tamara's new nail technician a try. I am so glad I did. The other pedicure/manicure place, that starts with an S (I prefer to just go with the first letter, and let it go), could not or would not listen to make sure to help me with my ingrown problem one of my big toes. I am an avid hiker, and hiking with bad toes is a huge no-no! Coming back from a huge hiking trip in Colombia, I decided to go and get another pedicure, even though I just had one done less than 2 weeks ago. 

Nobody was available, until Sunday. Well.... I called Healing Wizdom and begged if anyone was available sooner. They said Sarah would be more than happy to stay longer to help me. I was so happy! I have never met her or seen her work, but right from the get go I noticed she is very clean and detailed with her working station. That's a huge plus for me! 

She looked at my feet and right away told me that my feet are very healthy except for that stupid toe. 

She took her time and was very careful in not hurting me. I could feel immediate relief! 

I highly recommend her! 

She might be new in Healing Wizdom, but she knows her ""passion"". The quote of ""Choose a Job You Love, and You Will Never Have To Work a Day in Your Life""? She fits in this! She loves what she does and you will love her too! Sarah, thank you for staying so late and looking forward for my next appointment!"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"After my normal nail tech (Cindy) was out of town, I decided to go to a different salon. The place is clean and the staff was friendly. The only thing that I didn't like was that the nail tech was rushing. My nails look great. The tech also seemed a bit rushed. I will probably go back but I will not be going back. I've been here twice now and I love the service and the cleanliness of the salon. I'm from out of town and my boyfriend and I have been going to this nail salon for the past 6 months and I've never had a bad experience. The owners are friendly and do a great job on their work. I've never had a bad experience. It's always clean and everyone is very nice and nice. I also love that the pedicure chairs are new and new. I love the fact that they have a huge selection of nail polish colors and their gel polish selection is very limited. The only negative is the wait times are not too long. I usually go to get my pedicures and I have had a manicure and dip done and the lady does a great job on my nails. I have a pedicure and I'm never had a great pedicure. The best mani. The owner is the owner and she is a good with gel manicurist. I've never been to my nails. she's a techs. She's great. My husband and he's wife."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I suspect this review will never show up on Yelp, but lets find out. I would not recommend this salon. I had a very bad experience with Suzi. I waited for more than a week before writing this (letter sent to the salon, too). All I wanted was an apology from the stylist that ruined my hair. Why is it so hard for people to just admit a mistake? 

There was no miscommunication. I brought in photos - of ME with my hair styled the way I wanted it. I had spend 4 months growing out my hair so I could do that!  Suzi and I talked for at least 5 minutes about the photos and what I wanted. However, Suzi did the absolute opposite of what I asked. It was like she completely forgot what we had just talked about. To fix the mess, Lori had to step in and basically cut my hair off. My hair is now shorter than a ""man cut"" - super short and exactly what I told Suzi I didn't want! It will take another 4-6 months to grow out to where it was before I set foot in that salon!

Additionally, the salon ""stood behind"" the terrible stylist and has said nothing to me - no apology for ruining my hair just before my 2 long-awaited vacations I have coming up in the next few months. This salon does not ""stand behind"" its customers. Oh... I got a free haircut. Is that suppose to make me feel better about the salon?

If possible I would give negative stars because it's not just Suzi. The owners are to blame as well for allowing this kind of incompetence. So, watch out if you choose this salon - they don't have the customer's best interest at heart. Is that any way to run a business?"

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"DO NOT GO HERE! SCAM ALERT!

During Covid my elderly disabled mother was deathly ill while she was full-time caretaker of my blind, wheelchair-bound 83 year-old father. she called massage envy and asked to freeze her account. 

Now my father has died from Covid, when my mother explained her circumstance, she was not treated kindly but in fact, She was told she would have had to come in person to freeze an account. She was never told this! This was during Covid lockdown and she was especially susceptible so why would they not offer to mail her a document or email an edocument???


Now they are demanding payment for those months when my mom had frozen her account AND the owner will not speak to my mom!

In addition, the 16 months ( a massage a month) that she continued to pay for in order to support the small business ( even though she was sick), they are now insisting that she pay a $10 surcharge each time she used these massages she paid for!

Bcz she accumulated so many massages, she wanted to offer some to me, but they want an yet another additional fee for that!!

I wouldn't recommend the massages or facials anyway bcz the therapists smoke cigarettes and smell dreadfully. Twice the therapist had such awful foot odor, I could barely breath ( when you have yr face in the cradle 3ft from their feet- they should have clean sneakers!!!)

It took a lot to convince my mother to agree to get a massage because it requires her to leave my fragile father alone. It was even a bigger deal to agree to an expensive monthly commitment. She has been a customer for so many years you would think a smart and caring business owner would take care of thier oldest customer. It's sad when the elderly are taken advantage of."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"2/10/18. I made a less than 24 hour reservation for the Island hopping treatments which consisted of a body wrap, 80 minute hot stone massage, and a 25 minute facial. I was very happy that they were able to accommodate me at the last minute on my birthday. The spa looks like a quaint boutique style spa. The patio is absolutely beautiful and followed the color scheme of the spa which consists of blues. The waiting area is cozy, it has a fire place, hot tea, water, hibiscus water, trailed mix, and dried fruit to snack on, no alcohol tho   I went into a different room for each treatment I had, and each room missed the mark just a little. I think the rooms need different flooring, because the floor reminded me of a dark blue (sticking with their color scheme) industrial carpet. The lighting and music in each room is perfect but each room had a completely blank wall. I think if a relaxing picture was put up it would make a big difference. The person who did my wrap did a good job, but it felt like she ran out of time so I didn't stay wrapped very long. I love hot stone massages and to my surprise the older woman who gave my massage was excellent although I think stones need to be closer to massage table because there were many times when she was just at the stones and I wasn't being massaged nor was there a stone on me. The facialist seemed really knowledgeable although some of the products felt very watery, but in the end my face felt really good and moisturized. This spa does have many items for you to purchase. I would just say they slightly missed the mark. I would give them a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My husband and I were in Reno last weekend celebrating our wedding anniversary and we originally planned on booking massages at our hotel spa -- that is, until we saw the prices.  So we looked around for alternatives and came up with Healing Wizdom.  For the same price as a half hour massage at our hotel spa, we got a full hour here.  Plus 5% off for booking together  :)

It was a little hard to find, but the GPS got us there and after a bit of poking around, we found it inside the little ""mall"".

The receptionist is very friendly and the place is a little on the hippie side but still cozy and inviting.  We didn't have to wait around before being brought in to our treatment rooms.  My masseuse was Matt and he did a terrific job.  He was very courteous, attentive, and thorough.  Probably one of the best massages I've ever gotten, actually.  He also integrated some hot stones into the routine which I've never had before -- it was a very nice touch.  

The treatment rooms are relaxing, although not very soundproof -- I could hear people in the front office talking the whole time.  But it wasn't really bothersome.

After the massage, we were given some really good herbal tea that tasted like apples & cinnamon.  After a weekend of breathing smoky casino air, it was pretty soothing on my poor throat.

The only thing I found the place lacking was a shower facility -- after a massage, the last thing you want to do is put your clothes back on when you're all greasy!  Ha ha I know, I know....first world problems, right?  So yeah.  They still get 5 stars.  Next time we're in Reno, we will definitely make another appointment."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This location is very clean, friendly and flexible with appointments. I wrote a review a while back and my praises were the same but my complaint was their overwhelming sales tactics. Unfortunately it has not changed. Within 30 seconds of arriving they inform me of all their latest sales and package offers. Even though I decline, they literally go over the exact same sales pitch when I check out. This makes me feel ignored and it delays a speedy checkout. I continued to go because I loved my wax specialist, however she's not longer there. My last appointment was with someone else. She was friendly but bad mouthed my prior specialist, twice and implied that she (prior waxer) was let go due to her lack of pushing products. (This is not true as she always made me aware of products that would best compliment the service done that day). At my last appointment with this new girl, I was ""encouraged"" to buy six different products and only half of them were for the services I was having done. If I would have bought everything that they pushed on me (products and wax packages), I would have spent about $600, no exaggeration. While I respect that companies want to make money and sell things, to be overly encouraged to buy stuff multiple times in one appointment (after my first response being ignored), and to hear one coworker bad mouth another for the same thing, makes it seem that they believe in the money first, customers second approach. I get multiple services done at each appointment and although their prices are affordable it's not a cheap visit, so to be pressured to spend more and leave feeling guilty for not doing so has made it an unpleasant experience. Because of that I am going to try other places, even though I really liked EWC."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I will never go back here again. I have been a consistent client for over 6 years with appointments every month. They reopened and I went in for an appointment and had to take my kids because I cannot leave them alone only for one of the staff members to be very rude and told me I need to leave my kids were not allowed in. How was I suppose to know?! No one communicated that to me. Also they require face masks. Again no communication and told me I should have looked at their website. Why would I look at their site?!? They contacted me about setting up an appointment! No one told me. Incredibly rude. No compassion or kindness and the staff member judging me and rude get over yourself! You will not got clients treating people like that.

I understand having policies to reopen especially during these times. You are missing the point when you think that is an opportunity to treat your clients like dirt. The woman who spoke to me had a look and tone of disgust as how dare I step foot in your establishment. There are a way to handle things, period! It is called CUSTOMER SERVICE. If that woman approached me and said I am sorry ma'am unfortunately due to circumstances we cannot allow children. I would have said oh wow I am so sorry I did not realize and politely left. No. She was very rude and the other staff members did not step in and try to recover in any way. Regardless of policies, circumstances, etc if you do not have customer service you do not have customers. At least not loyal, good paying that are faithful for over 6 years and very good tippers.

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This was not my first time there.  I was very excited about my apt.  I spent 3 years growing my hair out passed my shoulder blades.  It was not colored or damaged in any way and all one length. I have light brown/dirty blonde hair. I went in for a light dishwater blonde to platinum blond ombré.  I left with my hair fried, horrible highlights for about 3 inches, and yellow hair with brown patches throughout the rest.  Nothing blends, my haircut is completely botched, and the length of my hair needs cut off.  You can see where ever foil was put into my hair.  I had a level 3 stylist ""Carrie"".  I'm furious to say in the least.  I have done better work with a $10 box of color from cvs (no exaggeration).  I really can't believe a salon of this stature let me leave the building like that.  

I have since had some corrections to my hair.  It has been toned way down and my new & very talented stylist at Hot Heads in Muncie tried to blend more dark into my hair to hide Carrie's disaster of a color.  You can still see the foil lines and patches.  When my hair is healthy enough for bleach she's going to try to fix that.  Natalia took my hair from dull crunchy and neon yellow to very soft and shiny ash blonde.  Thankfully nothing had to be cut off and it just needs to grow out some for her to fix my chop job.  It's still not where it should be but at least we are going in the right direction now.  I won't be going back to Kiss.  If you want beautiful healthy blonde hair go see Natalia at Hot Heads in Muncie."

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"While eating out yesterday our waitress recommended going to get an inexpensive hair cut at Paul Mitchell the School, after we had asked her for some advise. 

Today being Saturday we were told that they do not take appointments and that  it's first come first serve, so we signed our waivers and waited. Had my friend not been getting her hair cut and colored I would have left but since I had to wait for her I thought, why not? The wait was 1 1/2 hours and the place was not very busy. 

My friend had gotten a hair color that turned out very nice and I was happy with my trim. However, my poor friends hair was completely butchered by the student. While my friend was understanding and patient, the problem was not with her hair even though she was disappointed. 

It was the instructor, which was the same rude lady who was running the front desk that was the problem. She really handled the situation poorly. 

You could obviously see in the young students face that she was embarrassed by the cut she gave my friend. When the instructor approached she said ""Do not say anything about the cut and do not disrespect my student, you signed a waiver."" I was sitting next to my friend who didn't say anything before the instructor showed up. I was shocked!

That instructor was completely out of line and my poor friend left the school feeling confused and sad. 

If it's a simple trim you would like I'd say sure why not. But if you are looking for something a little more intricate go to a professional salon. You are absolutely a guinea pig at the school. 

The instructor should learn to have some manners and deal with situations like this instead of being so mean. That was the most disappointing experience of all of this."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I LOVE YOU TRENDY NAILS.

Nail techs are very nice and professional. 

The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. 

I have had a lot of bad experiences with other nail salons. 

I have tried several nail salons in the area and have found them to be the most consistent. 

They are very clean and the staff is very professional. 

This is the only nail salon I will go to for my pedicures! 

I would recommend this place to anyone. 

I have a great friend who likes to go there. 

They have a great selection of gel colors, but I like that they have a huge selection of gel colors to choose from. I've had a few bad experiences here, and the last time I went was for a refill. The fill lasted about 3 weeks, and the nails themselves lasted 4 weeks. 

My only complaint is that they have a small selection of gel polish, but I'm a big fan of regular polish and it lasts a week, and a half the price is a month. They only have a dozen dollars a week.Worst experience. I've been here twice now and I had a manicure and gel pedicure, two days, my nails chipped and two of my nails have chipped. The girl, one of my nails peeled. My nails are chipped. The other broke off, 2 days later. They charged me and my hands,"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"It has taken me a long time to write this review, because I tried to get over my bad experience here, but almost 2 years later, am still scared to get my hair cut again. I went to Forever Yung shortly after its opening, and my appointment was with the owner. I went for a trim with long layers and some PURPLE highlights. I was there for EIGHT hours (yes, 8). They bleached highlights for so long that my hair looked like dry yellow straw, and in the end left with GREEN (and in some places aquamarine) bangs, and some blue-ish streaks in the back. To offset the intent of highlights (which, even in ridiculous colors were not very visible) she dyed the rest of my dark brown hair black, but unevenly so that it was no consistent black, but rather streaky shades of brown and black. Not only was the cut uneven and choppy, but she also cut off over 3"" after I specifically said I didn't want to lose length. After cutting, she said ""I know you're not gonna be happy because I took off way more than you wanted."" I was charged full price, and in fear of further damage and loss of another entire day, had to pay to have it fixed elsewhere (at AURA, where they did an AMAZING job of correcting the color and cut). I actually cried when I got home and really looked at the mess she had made. I have been afraid to get my hair trimmed ever since, and have refused any color since the correction, in an attempt to heal my hair. I assumed that the business wouldn't last, since it was, in my 26 years, the WORST hair appointment I've ever had, but since they are still operating, I feel obligated to warn others. This salon is the reason for my fear of haircuts."

I have been going to them for years. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. They offer a great selection of colors and do a great job. I have a hard time finding a salon that I like, but I have found it. I love that they have a parking lot in front of the building and have a parking lot right next to it.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"On Sunday I went in looking for a liquid gel full set. The wait was not long and I was helped, but during the process the woman did it wrong. She didn't cut back cuticles or lay down a base layer/primer for the gel nails. Now two days later they are lifting up. She ground down my nails very thin as if she was applying acrylic and then put the gel on. While she was setting the gel on I continually asked her to reach the edges of my nails but she did not and ended up filing part of the edges of my natural nails inward to match the width of the gel nails. I asked for square nails and essentially have polygon nails. This made my gel nails look like little teeth sitting on top of my real nail, which you can see my real nail on both sides of the gel nail. When I pointed out that some of the shapes were inconsistent from the real nail she reapplied extra gel but the edges ended up so gagged they caught on the fabric of my clothing and have chipped/broken off now. Not to mention since she ground my nails down so thin I had to purchase a nail restore kit for the exposed nails. The thickness of each nail is inconsistent as well as the length. This is beyond the worst nail service I've ever gotten, and not to mention a complete rip off. They changed $65 for the gel nails and an additional $10 to add glitter to my thumb and ring finger nails. I wouldn't be upset with the price if the quality matched it, but it simply doesn't. At all. Not even close. When I paid for the service she stared at me for an uncomfortable several seconds to ensure she would receive a tip. I'm beyond livid with this experience."

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Caution! I purchased a Groupon for 3 services. It was a real challenge to get someone to answer the phone multiple times. I finally got through and had to book over 3 months in advance. 
When I arrived, the gal at the front counter asked me 3 times what my name was. But the spa was very small and I'm pretty sure I wasn't only 1 of 2 people in there the entire time I was there.
Facial was not at the level of expectation and I was inadvertently charged an extra $35 to have my black heads extracted?!?! A facial is supposed to include that. The extraction left my face with noticeable marks the next morning and she never even got to my chin area. Besides that, the effort was a D- at best. I was actually wondering if the girl was licensed as she sure didn't seem to be knowledgeable (and happened to be the same girl that checked me in at the front desk).
The massage was okay at best. The table was REALLY narrow and I felt like I was getting lotion rubbed on me rather than a massage. 
The manicure was done by guess who? Yup...the same gal that checked me in and did my facial. Poor effort. I got home and had to file my nails and clean the scrub she used from under them. Disappointing...
Overall, I DO NOT recommend you use this Spa. Hokey and treatments were the worst I have ever experienced. 
I would also caution anyone still crazy enough to use this spa to ask to see licenses. I am fearful as an after thought that they may be using unlicensed people to do their treatments. Everyone that worked there complained about the Groupon deals making them work longer hours. 
The spa itself was small, weirdly small connecting rooms and noise control in rooms poor. 
Not worth any amount of money."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"I used to think chiropractors are an art form, but I saw a lot of people recommended them. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. I came in with a deep tissue massage, and it was fantastic. I was greeted warmly and offered a beverage. I was greeted immediately and offered a drink. I waited for about 30 minutes before I was taken to the massage chair. I sat down and was taken back to a room. After about 30 minutes of my massage, I was offered a drink. I was offered a drink. After my massage, I was taken back to the room. I was not asked if I wanted a drink, which I declined. I sat down at the desk and I was told to pick my color and go to the bathroom. I sat down with my feet soaking for about 10 minutes. I had to go to the bathroom to wash my feet. I thought it was strange that I hadn't gotten a full set of feet before and had been getting them done before. After that, I asked if I could move to have my feet soaked. I told them and they would have a seat. I should have my feet soaked. They told them. After soaking my feet in the water. I was taken my feet in the bowl. My feet and then told them to soak. I left.

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"Came with a friend at 9:30am for a pedicures, eyebrow wax and fills.

The pedicure was alright but nothing really impressive. Even with upgrading, the best part was the hot towel. The sugar scrub was short lived and the massage was subpar. 

My eyebrows were executed perfectly except that the technician got wax in my baby hairs along my forehead. 

When it came to fills, the younger gentleman who did mine insisted on removing my existing nails for a new set. I didn't put up a fight because I've had it done in the past and it usually isn't too bad but I instantly regretted it. He was far from gentle and DESTROYED my nail beds, causing them to crack and bleed throughout. It was extremely painful and he really showed no mercy regardless of me telling him he was being too rough. While my nails bled, he continued with whatever stinging fluid he put on top of each nail and as I winced, he said it would go away once he started applying the acrylic powder. It did not.

I asked for square french ombre and instead of a pink shade, he went with a nearly gray shade of white - not what I requested with my photo reference. After requesting SQUARE 3 times, the technician still shaped them coffin and claimed they were square. He also used too much clear gel on the top that it dripped on the sides of my nails and had me re-filing it off at home.

I left in pain, feeling totally ripped off and knowing I was not going back. Now that I've returned to my usual salon, I was shown just how bad the technician damaged my nails. They were the wrong size and dried blood was showing through the acrylic. They needed to be carefully removed AGAIN and my usual technician was 10x more gentle and gave me such a better experience."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"I'd been going to Skin Solutions for years and although wasn't overly impressed with the latest hires or quality of service over recent years, I'd never had any major issues until recently.  

A mole was misdiagnosed as normal by the PA (Kelsey Mauro) and even when I went back to just have it removed, nothing was stated about any concern at all.  Until I was called a few days later stating it was a Basal Cell Carcinoma and I needed Mohs surgery. The incompetence (wrong area marked for surgery pix), inability to provide truthful information (quote for the cost of the surgery way off), and lack of patient care (no discussions on closing options ie. graft/no graft) proved that this practice is more concerned with billings than their patients' health.  

For example, I was only informed that the grafts for closing were optional when I went in for the suture removal & was told it failed to take so I ended up with the same healing as no graft.  And yet Skin Solutions charged my insurance company $1,040 for the graft (not included in my billing quote)!  Wonder why it wasn't discussed with me prior to the surgery.......

I am now 3 months out from the surgery and am not at all pleased with the healing time or results.  They don't adequately prepare you for the surgery or recovery - and they should be experts by now with the volume they push through.  I will note that they invited me back to ensure I was happy with all results however once you've lost faith in any provider, especially a medical provider, it's pretty much over.  I wouldn't go back for any reason and would strongly recommend that others stay away.  Skin Solutions is more about what they can bill you than what is even needed or what's best for the patient."

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This company is the first company I have written a bad review for. Here is whst ive veen dealing with for over a week now. Their employee Tracy who booked my spa services obviously didn't know what she was talking about when she booked the services and she actually said as much to me at the time but when I went in she ended up being the one massaging me and it was absolutely far beyond the worst massage I have ever had in my entire life she was pinching me the entire time and saying that it was getting rid of my toxins. It hurt! To make matters worse she continues to lie to the manager / director when we got out of the massage room, the director said that she would take care of things with the owner and that the two of them would get back to me. Well the owner never did contact me she pushed it back down to the director, the director pushed it back down to Tracy -the original liar who gave me the worst massage ever. I am left to deal with Tracy who continues to lie and this entire organization is made up of unethical lying people and no one wants to take responsibility for an issue. They know that I'm unhappy with what happened I've been trying to be reasonable with them I even offered to pay for half of the service and you know what they did instead? They ran my credit card which they had on file for the full amount without my permission - yes you heard me right. Not impressed, and I am very strongly considering taking them to small claims court even though it'll cost me time they need to be outted and they need to pay for their mistakes. What do you think?

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"This is in regards to their Massage service- I cannot attest to skin care. 

I GOT UP AND WALKED OUT OF MY PRE-PAID MASSAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT!!! That should give you a good indication of my experience. I have been treating myself to massages bi-annually for over 20 years. Some have been fabulous, some...eh...not so great. NEVER have I walked out of one. 

I had a 90 minute massage scheduled. She asked me if I wanted hot rocks and I declined. She pressured me by saying it did not cost extra and while it was relaxing my back she would work on other parts of my body. And that she only left them on for 10 minutes max, usually closer to 5 minutes. I acquiesced. We walked in the massage room and she left me to get undressed. She did not return for a full 10 minutes. No-one needs 10 minutes to get undressed and lay down on a massage table. Massage starts 10 minutes late, and not because I wasn't ready but because she took her time returning.

Next 50 minutes were ok. I'd grade it a C. Not horrible but nothing to praise. Then she put hot rocks on sheets on my back. I could hardly feel the heat so they were of no benefit. Then she left the room so I could 'relax'. She returned not 5 minutes, not 10 minutes, but 23 MINUTES LATER!!! I sat and watched the clock tick by on the wall. I had 7 minutes left of my 90 minute massage and she had only massaged me for 50 minutes. I got up, got dressed, and opened the door to her scurrying down the hallway looking surprised I was dressed and ready to leave. Are you kidding me??? HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Owner didn't even call to try to make amends which, in my book, degrades the entire business. Don't waste your money here."

DAMN GLAD I FOUND THESE GUYS! This gem delivers a REAL man's haircut by a REAL man's barber. I'm trying for a short high-fade pomp with an unfortunately pronounced receding hairline. Bobby fixed me up real nice. These guys are no BS, meticulously thorough, and genuinely concerned with providing great service.

If this is your first time, consider these elements of barbershop etiquette:

1. Walk in calmly, give all the men in the room a simple nod with a confident ""good morning"", and take a seat.
2. Keep to yourself and don't look at the men having work done. They're not on display; they're men.
3. Be prepared to wait. Twenty-five to 30 minutes per man is not uncommon.
4. As you are called up, know what you want or at least have a picture. There's not much time to him-haw and no necessity to jaw-jack.
5. Relax and absorb the mello-toned oldies while the man-at-hand works his magic on your dome piece.
6. When the job is complete and your manliness has been reinstituted, compliment him with an exchange of pleasantries and a firm handshake.
7. Pay the man in cash. Since the prices have increased to $15, a $20 bill works quite nicely.
8. Be on your way.

I spent my last 20-something years with the chain salons. I'll spend my next 60-something years at Southtown."
Beauty & Spas,1.5,CG,"Worst gel manicure ever!!!! I asked for the design and they did not even make it even! They just did a horrible job! I will not be returning!I have been a customer for years. They are friendly and efficient. I am always pleased with my service. I always get the gel mani. I have never had to wait long and have never had to wait. I also get a pedicure and I love the scrub and massage. I have a hard time finding a place that is friendly and takes their time. The nail techs are also very thorough. I usually have a bad experience with my nails but I do not have to worry about my nails. I am very pleased with my service and will continue to go back.They do a great job and I've had a good experience here. I have been going to the same place for a few months and I love it here. However, I have had some of the staff members do a good job on my nails and they are very rude and seem to be in a hurry. I've had to wait almost an hour before getting my pedicure and then when I got to get a pedicure. I finally get my nails done and they start getting my eyebrows done and they were done at the gel nails done. It was done in 20 minutes before they start to my toes. I left them done. I waited 25 mins and they started to get my nails done and they were done and they were done and left. They charged me. I had to get them done and my nails done. I got them done and"
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"This is a solid barbershop. Being a black man usually requires a certain type of barber to cut hair. He or she doesn't necessarily have to be black, but they should probably have some experience in cutting black hair. It can be difficult to find a good barbershop on the north side that checks all those boxes, but Casablanca comes pretty close for my tastes.

First off, $15 for a cut is a great price when other barber shops charge $18+ for the same services rendered. Another huge deal is that Casablanca takes credit card payments. The other barber shops I've been to still use the decrepit system of cash only, which is pretty frustrating, especially when you have to withhold a tip (I don't tip on poor haircuts).

The location is also a good one. It's right off the highway exit and close to 4th Street and Gandy in a wide open shopping plaza.

The most important thing for me is that my barber knows how to cut my hair. I've only been to one other barber at Casablanca -- the owner, who sits in the first chair -- and I was less than pleased with my haircut. He didn't seem experienced cutting my kind of hair, and that's fine, because not everyone is. But my guy cut it exactly how I wanted it and I haven't looked back.

Most of the customers I see here at white. Whether black, white, Hispanic, or any other persuasion, it seems like this place can do it all. It might take trial and error for you to find your guy, but chances are, he's at this location. I've gotten better haircuts at other places, but for longer waits, more money, and less convenience.

One note: there are no appointments at Casablanca, so be prepared for a wait some unless you go at just the right moment.

All in all, I'm pleased and I'll continue to come back. 4 stars for solid consistency."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,CG,"6/30/2018:  I made an appointment for the 1st time for a Brazilian wax. I was not able to get in the schedule for a Brazilian wax but the receptionist was able to get me in the same day. I was referred to the receptionist and was given the option of a 2 hour massage. I was very pleased with the service and the ambiance. I will definitely be back. Came here for my first Brazilian wax. I was nervous because I'm from out of state, but I was so pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure what she was doing, but she was really knowledgeable and made sure I was comfortable. She's great at what she does, and I've never felt better after my wax. She also gave me a great deal for my first wax. I will definitely be going back. This place is amazing!! They are very accommodating and I love the way my nails turned out! I will definitely be returning. My nail tech was very thorough and patient and did a good job. I was very pleased with the results. I recently went to this nail salon and was very disappointed. The girl I got a pedicure and the other woman who did not very nice but they don't care. She said ""felt like she was very nice. It was rude. My nails were filed and rushed and cut me with her cut my cut my skin off and took a cuticle and cuticle. I got a nail and cut my skin off and cut me. I was bleeding but was bleeding. I asked her cuticle."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"Really disappointed. 
Had a 11am appointment for a dip mani, they didn't wrap my nails until 11:40pm. 
Once I'm finally wrapped, they move me to another chair.
(To my amazement: They have odd dip powder that is mood polish style? Yanno, the kind you use when you're 8... this isn't explained anywhere so initially my nails looked white. When I asked why, the technician explained it to me and I had to change polishes.)
I'm then moved to another chair.
They kept apologizing but it's clear that they overbooked and we're rushing. 
Next I'm told to sit tight and wait for a top coat to dry... meanwhile my skin is completely painted with said top coat.
I was told it was time to pay from who looks like the manager. I asked him if he could remove the top coat from my skin and he scrubbed so hard that he ripped the skin near my cuticle and it started bleeding. 
At this point I was very fed up. (2 hours later)
The manager insisted that he needed to finish clearing the polish from my skin and I said: ""no thank you, I really need to leave now"". He asked over and over again, with tweezers in his hand to give him my hand. He even had the audacity to try to reach and grab my hand.
Now I am frantic to get out of there, no idea why this man would try to reach for my hand after I said no multiple times. 
He then grabs my card and tells me it's 35$. I couldn't believe he'd charge me full price after all of that!! He said ""everyone pays 35$, everyone!"". I left my tip $ on the counter, although 4 people helped me I guess they could all split it. He tried to hand me some kind of coupon as if I'd want to come back...
This was thee most uncomfortable experience I've ever had at a nail salon. Absolutely disgusting."

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"BEWARE you are being watched...
Arrived at my hair stylist who has recently moved to the up stairs of European fitness center,  Nice looking salon white marble tile floor clean, inviting  salon.   
As I start looking around there is hair all over the floor but no other people in the salon. There was hair on the floor that the other operators who had left for the day decided to leave for somebody else to clean up? 
My awesome hair stylist finally gets underway with me...Some of her other clients arrived and had a seat in the waiting chairs. The daughter who was awaiting her appointment, probably 6 years old, Began doing a little hopscotch dance to the music. (Nothing offensive, but I would not let my child do that.)  My hair stylist received a phone call on her cell ;  I overheard The ""male voice told her she had to have her client sit down and stop dancing"" ... When you go to the Hair Salon apparently you are on CCTV. How horrifying to tell your client their child is not Allowed to stand up while they are awaiting their haircut. 
And OMG I'm on CCTV while I' m at the Hair Salon?  Who looks attractive when your hair is sopping wet and being dried restyled colored or ect?  I am appalled that somebody would actually sit there and watch you and television while your at the spa. What kind of a sick O does that? 
 I'm wondering do they watch the women in the locker Room getting dressed down stairs when they're going to the gym?
 I think that it is sick behavior to sit and watch somebody on TV while they are at a spa.  I find it more disturbing that they may be observing anybody who is in the locker Room being dressed as well?
 BEWARE Reno if you go to European fitness center!"
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"So I will start by saying that I am very picky about my hair, I have long hair and I am very particular about my hair. My hair is very thick and I wanted to go short. I found out that I am extremely picky about how my hair looks and I knew I needed to change my mind to keep it short. I made an appointment for a cut and color and was immediately seated with Amy. She was extremely nice and friendly and gave me a great cut and color. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she gave me a great cut. I highly recommend Amy and her team for all your hair needs. I can't wait to come back to get my hair cut and color done here. I went here to get my hair cut for my graduation. I asked for a little longer but she made it look good. She was very quick and took her time. She gave me a great cut and I would definitely recommend her. She is a great stylist and she is a sweetheart. I recently moved to the area and was looking for a new nail salon. I was very pleased to find this place. I found them on yelp and decided to try it. I was able to make an appointment. I got an appointment and when I got there. I got in and they were seated right away from there. They did not even gave me a great service and they took my name.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I've wanted bigger boobs for a long time. I naturally have a pear shape physique and always wished to have breasts that would compliment my figure. I was tired of wear certain tops/dresses and looking like I had a flat chest. This past summer was when I decided to do something for myself and look into getting a breast augmentation. I did countless hours of research on the procedures and doctors in the area. I met with 4 surgeons before my hair stylist said that before I made a decision on who my surgeon would be, I had to go see Dr. Eberbach in Hudson FL. I am so grateful that she told me about Him. Working in the medical field, I have worked along many doctors and surgeons. It's very rare to find a doctor, let alone a surgeon who has amazing bedside manner. Dr. E truly makes you feel comfortable and it is evident that he's putting your health and happiness first. My consultation was great, Leah the patient coordinator was so welcoming and very informative of the whole process. I was able to use a 3D scanner to get a better idea of what my results could look like, being a visual person.. this was huge for me! He understood the look I was going before but also informed me of what was realistic for my body. I wanted a fuller look but still natural looking.. and he executed! Dr. E spent 30 minutes just with me! He was patient, kind, and you just get a sense from him that he has your best interest at heart. His work is phenomenal, he is highly skilled and a qualified surgeon and just brilliant. Recovery was almost painless, very easy, the staff was always available to answer any and all silly questions I would have. I highly recommend Dr. E because you will not regret it! This experience I had is how everyone's experience should be"

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,I wish I had looked deeper into the reviews prior to coming here. I was in the area which is thankfully away from my house and saw the overall rating but didn't realize that most of the reviews were old. I came in for a pedicure and I was seated right away which was great. The pedicure started out ok. The lady put a scrub on my legs and wrapped them each with a warm towel before removing the polish and clipping my toenails but after about 10 minutes the towels got cold and the water in the tub also got cold. It was a little bit uncomfortable sitting with cold towels wrapped around my legs while she cleaned my feet. What ruined everything for me was how rough she clipped my toenails. She grabbed the little scissor clippers and started clipping my ingrown toenails and I have had other pedicures do this but this lady was rough! So rough that the right side of my toenail started to bleed a little. I should have told her to stop but I also wanted her to get rid of the dead skin which is what I thought she was doing at first but then she dug in to the right side of my toenail and clipped my skin which made me jump. I was almost in tears. She quickly covered my toe nail with her hand so I wouldn't see the blood as if I couldn't feel the pain.  I could tell she tried to make up for that by giving me a really good foot massage and I wasn't going to leave a review but then after I paid I looked at my toenails and realized they were all clipped somewhat crooked especially the big toe. I will have to go to another salon to get it fixed. It just looks embarrassing. The salon wasn't busy at all so I don't understand why she rushed so much.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I have been going to DL Lowry Hairspa Boutique throughout the last three years while attending school at a nearby University. The salon and spa are BEAUTIFUL. The simplicity and style is what attracted me to them initially. The layout and decor is unique and helps creates their overall feel and sophistication. You truly feel pampered from the moment you walk in. I have always felted very welcomed and taken care of. I call for an appointment and have no problem getting in on my time frame. You walk into the salon and immediately will be greeted from the receptionists at the desk. As you enter it's a boutique-like feel with racks of clothes and shelves of jewelry, makeup, beauty, and hair products for purchase. It's always filled with stylists who are occupied by customers (great sign). 

At this point I have only used their spa services for eyebrow waxing and shaping. This is back in the spa. The spa has it's own place separate from the open hair salon. I'm immediately relaxed by the ambiance which includes soft music, candles, smells, and comfort. It is very personalized. Since my first appointment I have been paired with Monica Bloomer and have requested her since. My eyebrows have never looked better. She has helped shape them into what I have been trying for for years. She is a certified esthetician and massage therapist-  always so warm and personal. We always have great convo. It is a pricey $25 for a short 5-10 min brow wax and shape appointment, but it is worth every penny knowing I will walk out happy. I have had nightmare experiences for years before this at other salons where stylists have no idea what they're doing and have butchered my brows taking years to get them back to normal. I am looking forward to getting my hair done or a massage/facial in the future. I am confident they are one of the best in Indianapolis."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"If I could give less than 5 stars I would. I came in for a gel manicure. I had an appointment and I waited for 45 mins before someone even started my nails. The girl doing my nails rushed through the process, was rushing through the process, and did not give me a manicure at all. I did not feel relaxed about the experience at all. I will not be returning. I came here to get my eyebrows done and I have a hard time finding a place that did them exactly how I wanted. I walked in, they were very busy and I was sat immediately. The lady doing my eyebrows was very nice, but the lady doing my pedicure was very rude and seemed annoyed to me. I told her I wanted to leave and she said it was ok. I asked her if she could give me a pedicure. She said that she would. I asked her to please put the polish on my toes and she said no. I told her I didn't want to leave. She started on my toes. She then took me to the back to the back and told me to sit there. I had to sit in the pedicure chair. I sat there. I told her I was waiting for about to wait for 30 mins and she told her to wait for 15 mins before she started on the chair. I waited 45 mins. I waited 45 mins before she finally got up and she went to leave. She said yes. She took off and then said yes I waited 45 mins before she was rudely stood there and said I sat down and started doing my hands down."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"My sister recently started coming here and loved the work they did so as a bday gift her and my mom scheduled and paid for an appointment for me to get my hair done. My stylist was Brittany. When we got there she took me right away. I was a few minutes late due to traffic but she didn't seem annoyed or rushed at all. She was really nice, laid back and took the time to listen to what I wanted and the results I was looking for. I wanted to go blonder so I decided on a full head of highlights and told her to chop a few inches off as my long hair was becoming more of a pain than anything else. She  got right to work...she didn't try and talk me out of or into any particular cut or shade of blonde other than what I told her I wanted; I appreciated this because I've had stylists (at other salons) do this to me in the past and it results in me paying for a style that I'm less than thrilled with and walking away feeling unsatisfied. 

Another thing I REALLY liked was that during my appointment she was only working on me and not juggling multiple clients at once. That may sound weird but go-to stylists in the past I've gone to do this all too often. I understand the reasoning behind trying to squeeze in as many clients as possible but as a client it's really frustrating when you're paying top dollar for a professional's time and service that you end up sharing with other people because something that should've taken 2-2.5 hours is now taking upwards of 4. 

Brittany did a wonderful job and my hair transformation was amazing. It looked and felt so much healthier and prettier! Also the vibe at the salon was relaxed and friendly. Overall my experience was great so I'll definitely be returning to Bombshell and Brittany again."

Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Greco Rose provided hair and makeup for four women, including myself, for my wedding in June 2016, and I'm very glad I chose them. Elyssa was responsive and easy to work with during the planning process, and she was particularly helpful and reassuring on the phone during our consultation. I booked Jessica Harrington for makeup and Dori Ann Wetzel for hair and met both women for the first time for my trial appointment. Jessica and Dori were both friendly and accommodating, making changes during the trial based on my opinions. I decided my trial makeup look was a bit more intense than I wanted, and when she showed up on the wedding day, Jessica mentioned that she'd been thinking about my concerns and detailed how she planned to soften the look a bit. I appreciated that she had really listened to my thoughts and figured out how to create the look I wanted, which she then proceeded to do. The makeup Jessica did on my wedding day was exactly what I wanted for myself, and our three brides/groomsmaids all looked beautiful as well. All the makeup looks were coordinated but distinct, which was exactly my vision. As for hair, Dori created four hairstyles that had a similar aesthetic but were different for each women. I was thrilled with my look--I didn't know my hair could do that!--and with how gorgeous my friends looked. 

I was very satisfied with the work from Greco Rose and would certainly hire them again. A final point: I paid extra for Jessica to stay and touch up my makeup after the ceremony, because I knew I'd be sobbing, and that was money well spent! If you're a weeper, consider having your makeup artist stay around to fix your look after you've cried some of it off. 

For reference, you can see three of the (gorgeous) hair looks from my wedding on Dori's Instagram: my updo: https://www.instagram.com/p/BGQgK7vPovd/; my husband's sister's French twist: https://www.instagram.com/p/BGQXpcAvor7/; my bridesmaid's chignon: https://www.instagram.com/p/BGQcF4Gvomo/."

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"If you are looking to be ignored and want to waste your entire day, go here. My family and I walked in and stood at the front door for a few minutes (all barbers looked up when we came in) before anyone would acknowledge us. When we were finally acknowledged it was with a rude, ""What do you want"". I told the barber that my husband and son needed Gentleman's haircuts and my daughter and I would need the sides of our heads reshaved and designs put in. With a dirty look, he rudely again said ""okay"" and pointed at a very uncomfortable bench. We sat there, and sat there, and sat there. We saw multiple barbers standing around, playing on their phones, and goofing off with customers. Our last straw was when they let a friend of their's walk in and go before anyone else who was waiting (no appointment, by the way). When I asked why the friend was allowed to go before everyone waiting. With a smirk and laugh the barber said, ""oh he has an appointment I'll take care of you guys next"". So, one barber was going to cut all four of our heads? That would have taken forever! It would make logical business sense to spread us out amongst the other barbers. But that would require this business to be run properly and that is apparently not going to happen. This place is very dirty and very cluttered. It looks as if it has only ever been surfaced cleaned never deep cleaned. The barbers are rude, extremely lazy, ridiculously slow, and treat you as if you are bothering them. As long as my family and I are treated well we are very loyal customers. I'm also a very proper tipper as I have worked in the service industry for most of my young working life. I know how important a loyal client and great tipper is. Well they just lost out on my family and friends."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Kristen is a professional, yet very disrespectful and a bully. That held a grudge over me trying to schedule an appointment with her and trying to ask her questions when their site was not working... she said I was being too short with her in instagram messages that her marketing team handles.. a year ago!!  That's why I wanted to talk to a human being and ask questions, not just book an appointment online via platform that doesn't work properly. 

Today I came to see Kristen with a positive attitude and  an open mind to learn from her and become one of the regulars at her office. After all, with my hectic schedule I've been trying to come and see her for a year. However, she was rude and mean from the very first second. Didn't call me by my name but was rather referring to me as ""her, she""when talking to her front desk lady. 

Told me I had a demeanor... when I was simply asking to repeat questions... English is my second language and I do have an accent. I was simply and trying to understand her questions. 

They asked me if I have been in contact with COVID. 
Not that I know of- I responded. I mentioned that I live with a doctor and I'm at a high risk to get exposed, but I haven't been...or not that I know off. The symptoms don't show for 14, right?


I honestly have been admiring this person, Kristen it is, and following her work for a long time. Just to come in the office today and get treated like the lowest form of a human being.

Also she is now stating she declined to treat me... mmmm with the attitude that I got within 5 min of being in the office, I was going to walk out anyways. Some ppl are just full of themselves and can hold a for a year for something so minor... no need t say more..."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"Short story: Don't go here if you want to feel comfortable.

I have been to the front desk two times and each time, I have been treated with a smile and a smile.

The salon is in a large, clean space. I was greeted immediately and given a complimentary drink. The chairs are comfortable and comfortable. The staff is very friendly. I've had great experiences with my hair. I've had a few different stylists and all have been very good.

I've also had a cut by Joe, he's very professional and has great attention to detail. I've also had a highlight done by him, it looks amazing. I would recommend him to anyone.I have been to a few different nail salons in the area and I have finally found my go to!  I have been to many different nail salons over the years and this is the only place that I have tried that I will go back to.  My favorite is the atmosphere of the place.  The decor is modern and very modern.  I have been to many places in the city and this one is by far the best I have ever been to go to! !!!!!!!  I would recommend this nail salon!I had a manicure and pedicure.  

The lady was soooo and my nails look like I was done by the best of my feet.  she was a kid's nails a great I would never thought I would not know this place.  but I said I was very good I have never go back to go back there.  but this place and I will never"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I have been coming to Salon Fiber for about 2 years and LOVE the salon.  I found them after leaving a longtime stylist at another salon that was no longer convenient to my hours or home.  I was super stressed about finding a new salon/stylist and did exhaustive research on local salons via Yelp, google reviews, and Instagram.   

Through many visits and following the salon on social media I can tell that all of the stylists here are talented.  From balayage, to bold pops of color, to event hair, they have broad skill sets on hand.  

I was interested in balayage for a more natural look after doing a double process of dying my roots + foil highlights for many years.  I have been seeing stylist Briley for about a year and love the way my hair looks.  Briley is excellent at achieving beautiful natural looking balayage.  I love that it doesn't look super obvious that I've colored my hair whether I've gone lighter for summer, or darker for fall, it is a subtle enhancement that works well with my original coloring.  I appreciate how detail oriented she is, always talking through the details of what I'm looking for in cut and color.  I also appreciate the recommendations I've received from the stylists here on how to upkeep my color and overall hair health.  They carry some specialty lines of products that I was not familiar with before coming here, and I absolutely love the italian line Davines that they offer.

One important thing to note is that you need to allow a bit of extra time to find street or lot parking in Phoenixville.  There is a lot right across the street and behind the salon, as well as a few spots right out front.  But, depending on the time and day of week (or if there is an event in town), parking can require a few extra minutes."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"Writing this review is tough...beyond me, I feel like I need to write a review. 

I am very happy with my experience at Amrita Nails. I made an appointment for a manicure and pedicure on a Monday. I arrived at 11:30am and was seen right away. I was seated right away. The salon is very clean and the staff is very friendly. The pedicure was good. However, I will not be back. The manicure was sloppy and I have no idea why. I'm not sure what she was doing. She was rushing and doing a good job. The next day, I went back to get it fixed and I had to take off a gel manicure. She kept pulling my cuticles and it was so painful. I went back the next day to have it fixed. She said ""it's too late now."" She was not apologetic at all and it was obvious she was upset that I was not getting what I wanted. I went back in to get it fixed and she said ""I don't have a problem with that"". I will be back in the salon tomorrow and I'll have to go somewhere else"". I'm not be back tomorrow. I said ""just go home. I will not be waiting for the day to get it fixed"". I'm going back. I'm not even worse off work and I'll have to get a refunded because of a full refunded. She said ""lame back"" and leave. I said ""that fixed"" I have to have to the full refunded. I have a full refund"" and went back"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I visited Massage Heights as part of a Yelp Elite event. I expected to have a good experience, but I didn't anticipate having such a good experience that I would convert to make this my go-to destination for regular massages. I have had many massages in the past, and I have a favorite hands-on healer, but her weekday only schedule is difficult for me. Everyone at MH was super friendly. Due to unexpected circumstances at the Yelp event, I was offered a complimentary 30 minute massage to return at a different time. I decided to pay to extend from 30 to 90 minutes and add complimentary hot stones & aromatherapy. So glad I did. Jason was my massage therapist. He was a great communicator. He asked several questions to understand my needs, expectations, and boundaries. From the get go, I felt very comfortable. He created a quiet, soothing, therapeutic environment all while speaking up when necessary to affirm that pressure, movement, heat, and positioning were all comfortable to me. There are so many choices during a massage that people probably don't consider before going in. This ongoing communication is really great to help with that. I was given a choice among 4 different aromatherapy scents, and I was asked to let him know if the heated table felt too warm, or if the rocks were too hot, or if the pressure or movements were too strenuous. Everything was perfect. At the end, Jamie also gave me a ""homework"" sheet, showing areas where my body could use extra care - like in my right shoulder and lower back. He provided stretches I can do at home, and suggested I drink plenty of water. When it was all over, I was pleased enough that I decided to get a membership for monthly massages - especially since they accept FSA & HSA payment! #selfcare #sold Thanks, Yelp, for the intro! Will update my review over the course of my 1 year membership to review that process, too."

The waxing is a little painful but it's not as painful as the Brazilian, so it's not that painful.

Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I've been a patient here for just over 3 years and I think today I've finally had it. I started feeling sick on Friday, that Monday I made an appt to be seen on Tuesday. Appt went fine, I was told it was viral and could take upto 10 days but I should start feeling better in a few. Flash ahead to that Saturday (day 8)  when I wake up feeling even worse with a new cough and decided I wanted to at least try antibiotics.

 I submitted the request for antibiotics via the portal at noon, I then followed up with a phone call around 1pm to make sure the request was received because I knew they closed at 3pm on Saturdays. I spoke with a woman named Nicole who assured me the request had been forwarded to the on duty PA and I would receive a call when my Rx was called in. I patiently wait until about 2:20 and after checking the portal several times, no message or call. I then call the office at 2:30pm and I'm placed on an irritating loop saying the wait time is 1 minute for almost 10 minutes. 

Desperate for antibiotics before they close for the weekend, I decide to go down there in person. I arrive at 2:40pm and the office is closed. So basically someone decided they could just cut out early without any notification. That may work in a standard office setting but for a doctor's office, that is highly unprofessional. What else is unprofessional is there was a blood vial that I presume to be a sample taped to the door in 90+ degree heat. Not sure if it violated any HIPAA laws or biohazard procedures but in extreme heat, the integrity of such a sample can be adversely affected in minutes. Disgusting. Two stars because I love Dr. O'Brien and find her to be a great physician but this type of unprofessionalism by some of the other staff is unacceptable."

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,One of the worst pedicure experiences I have ever had. I arrive at the salon around 1130am. After about 15 minutes of waiting a motion to the back because there is a pedicure chair available the water has already been ran. I placed my feet in the water and noticed that it is Luke warm not hot. Not wanting to complain I sit there for about an hour by the end the water has turned completely cold. Feeling ignored I ask could someone please make the water hotter if I'm going to have to wait any longer. I was ignored. I asked a few minutes later for a second time if it will be possible if someone can make the water hotter and again I was ignored. Finally a guy comes over to start on my pedicure. The  guy that did my pedicure was so rude he took my foot out of the water and said wow I have my work cut out for me today (even tho it had only been two weeks since my last pedicure). Not only was that rude it was very hurtful. Then he went on to rush through the process of actually giving me a pedicure. Once I was done he told me just to sit in the chair and let my toes air dry he didn't even bother placing me under the dryer. After sitting there for about 30 minutes he finally came and got my shoes threw them done by the dryer and motioned me to go to the dryer so I can finish letting my toes dry the proper way. Once I made it home and really had a good look at my pedicure it was so horrible it was literally something that I could have done at home with supplies from Walmart do not waste your money going to the salon it is not worth it the staff is mean they are rude they rush you and they are not considerate or concerned at all.
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I have been going to this place for years and they are always friendly and welcoming. I have never had an issue with the front desk. The salon is clean and the staff is always friendly. The only reason I can't give it 4 stars is because I would never recommend this place to anyone!  I have had my nails done by a different person and she did a great job!  She was nice and nice but I don't like how she was talking about me in another language. I have been going to this nail salon for over a year now and I am really happy with the service and the quality of the work. It is a very good place for a pedicure and manicure. I only go to them because it is convenient. I have also tried the gel polish and my nails have never chipped. They always last me a while. I recommend this place to anyone. I have been getting my nails done at other places for about 7 years and this is by far the best one I have had. I'm very particular about the hair color and cut. I went to have never had my hair cut it long enough to have it long and it was a little to be short to be long enough to go in the short. It was long and then it wasn't short it was too short. I had a bit long. The color. I got a great I didn't cut off and it short it shorter then it but I said it was very short then it was short and the length and it was long but it was short I just so short to short.
Beauty & Spas,3.5,OR,"I'm visiting the area from Washington state and didn't have time to go see my gal there before I left.  So I called Regal since its right across the street from where I am staying.  
I have natural nails and get regular shellac manicures and color changes.  I am familiar with the process.  
I got a guy there and I immediately should have turned around and walked out when he pulled out his drill.  Shellac polishes should be soaked off so as to not damage your nails- but he drilled them off- and did a crummy job to boot.  
Next- was moved to the middle of the store where all of the drying lights are kept- and he stood next to me with my hand in the air.  He slapped 1 coat of clear on- dryed it- then very sloppily began doing my requested French tips.  I had requested red for the holidays.  The tips are ALL uneven, they do not reach the full side to side of my nails- they were way to thick- I asked to get them thinned and he got attitude- and said ""you want them thinner"" well yes.... That's what I just said.  They have NO shape to them either- no smile-  
Then- after uneven drying- he put two super sloppy coats on top- its slopped all over my fingers.
And I didn't think you could botch this up- but he didn't even properly remove the sticky top layer- and I left with sticky- horrible looking nails.  The only good thing was that when I paid with my debit card- I wasn't given the opportunity to tip- because either way he wasn't getting one.  AWFUL all the way around.  I'm sick that I even wasted $15.  Which by the way... Is the same amount I pay in Washington- so it's not even a matter of cheap service- it was just a bad place- save yourself- go somewhere else!"

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"No Stars should be an option for this business, I Was recommended to this place by a friend and I'm Only giving this place 1 star because I have to. My friend and I walked in there seeing as it says walk-ins welcome. As we walk in there is no one in the place except for the 4 people that are working there all of which are doing each other's nails, I proceeded to ask if my friend and I could get a full set they all stared at each other and then continued to work on each other's nails and didn't say anything for about a minute or so, so I sat down waiting on and answer...one of them finally says ""no we don't have anything today, can you come back tomorrow ?"" At this point I should've just walked out, if i wanted to get my nails done tomorrow don't you think I would've came then instead of today ? And why would I come back to you tomorrow when I can just go somewhere else and get them done today....so I said ""no I have work tomorrow"" she said ""what time do you get off"" at this point I can't believe she just asked me that, I said midnight and she said ""oh that's too late"" and I thought to myself no shit you don't say. So I said ""so you guys don't have anything today?"" She said ""No"" I didn't say anything else I just walked out.. what amazes me about these people in this establishment is that you rather sit there and do your co-workers nails whom of which probably aren't paying you a single dime rather than take 2 new customers in who are actually paying you ???

Beauty & Spas,1.0,OR,"This place just changed their name from Magic Touch - likely due to all the bad reviews and complains to groupon, wagjag, etc.  Below is my review from when they called themselves Magic Touch. It is the same location and same staff/owners.
________________________________________________

Good heavens!  Wagjag is offering this awful place again today - June 4, 2011.  WTH??

This is my first yelp review.  My experience was so horrible I feel compelled to write.

This place should be called Heinous Touch.

I bought one of these daily deals from Wagjag a few months ago and, wow, what a horrible experience.

The place is a dump, not anywhere near close to a serene spa.  How they call themselves a spa is beyond me.

My pedicure was with an older Russian or Polish lady who had extreme B.O.  She didn't do a very good job of exfoliating my feet and the massage portion of the pedi was extremely short.  The whole pedi probably took about 35 mins.  I am used to actual spas that take 1 hour to do a proper pedi.  This was highly disappointing.  She took me over to the massage room before my polish was dry and my toes all got smudged from laying on the bed.  They should have done the massage first and the pedi second to avoid ruining my polish.

The ""massage' left a lot to be desired.  She clearly was not a trained massage  therapist.  She did not evenly massage my body.  She spent a fair amount of time one areas on one side and completely neglected the same areas on the other side.  Her B.O. was overpowering.

At one point she started slapping - yes, literally slapping - my back.  It was extremely jarring.  Thank heavens I wasn't thoroughly relaxed or this would have been horrible - not that it wasn't awful anyway.

I will never go back and I am highly disappointed in WJ to see they are offering this horrible place again today."

Beauty & Spas,2.5,OR,"My friend and I went to get manicures the day before Christmas, so we were expecting busy. We walked in and put our names down. We sat for an hour as people who wrote their names after us were called and had their manicures done first. At one point they called my friends name and then said ""No sit back down."" I understand they were busy, but as I said people who came after us were being severed first. We went to the counter to ask if we were still written and the woman ran over and was very rude to us. She sat us at manicure station, but it wasn't until twenty minutes later that my friend's manicure was started and 10 minutes after that mine was started. 

I got a regular gel manicure that I have gotten there before, but the woman who did mine rushed through it. She rushed through soaking my nails and cutting my cuticles by not soaking and just using an electric remover that was not as efficient as I was looking for. She then cut one of my nails so short it bled- a lot.  She went as fast as she could with all layers and didn't even give me the two UV lights for an even drying of the nails. You can see the messed up strokes in my nails and they chipped the day after it was done. My friend had a nice woman who worked hard on her nails, that is why I did not give one star.  

I was beyond disappointed in my experience due to the fact that my manicure was rushed through since they did not have enough staff working for the amount of people who came in.

I have been to this salon many times and my most recent expericence is the only truly negative one I have had, but due to small errors before with me or people I have gone with/heard negative things from I will most likely not return for a while."
Beauty & Spas,4.0,CG,"I went into Kevin's salon and asked for an inch off of my hair, and the stylist proceeded to cut off the hair. I thought that was the most embarrassing part of it all. She cut my hair way too short, which was fine. My hair is still very short, but I was looking at my hair the next day, and I was on my way to dinner. I didn't want to look like a model, and I didn't want to feel like a model again. I wanted to be a little more short, but I'm not sure what she was talking about. She told me that it would be too short, but I don't know what she was talking about. I have never had a stylist take off too much off my hair. I had to go back home and cut off the length, but she was going to cut my hair way shorter than what I asked. I was hoping that I would have a better experience, but I just wanted to see how it was going to turn out. I'm very disappointed that I didn't get my hair cut the way I asked for.I've been going here for about a year and I've never had my nails done.

Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I had a appointment with Dr Hall who spent a lot of time with me going over breast augmentation procedure, risk etc. However, I requested to be a full C and the doctor would not help with sizing. For me, I am a modest person and was scared to end up looking to big. I decided to pay my 300 dollar fee to have a surgery schedule. First, that was a mistake on my part because that money is non refundable if you change your mind. I felt my first experience at this doctors office was like a car wash. Women lining up, the same spill from the doctor and not personal at all. I even heard outside my door before the doctor and assistant came in, they were laughing and saying, ""let's do this"" then they both walked in with game faces. I originally went to this doctor because all my girlfriends had and they to stated they do a great job. But one recent friend just had her surgery and he did not help her with sizing. She feels here implants are to small and she had to choose her size on her own. I did seek a second opinion and I decided to go with a different doctor. The doctor took time with me and listen to the size I wanted to achieve. The doctor did all my sizing with me and I walked away feeling happy that the doctor helped me pick out the right size for my body. I just had my surgery yesterday and I now have 325 cc overs. If I went to Dr Hall, the implant would have been 400-425 gel over. I'm 5'5, 125 pounds and I would have been really upset over the to large of implant for my body. Overall, I know a lot of people are happy with Dr Hall and I overall thought he was fine as well even though he seemed like a used cars salesman. But, my biggest disappointment was he not helping me with sizing."
Beauty & Spas,5.0,CG,"As all of the previous reviews say, the massage itself was a nice one, but the massage was a little too painful. I am not sure if the masseuse was a bit rough or just not as good as I would like, but it was definitely not worth it.

He seemed to be trying to get me to move a bit, so I asked him to please get my hands and feet massaged. He did not. I was just in a rush to get out of there, and he was doing a lot of steps that were being done, but I did not feel the effort to get them done right. I didn't like how it was handled, and it was not the best massage I have had in a long time.

I don't recommend this place at all. I will not be returning.My girlfriend and I went in to get our nails done at 12:00pm on a Saturday and they took us right away. The nail tech was very nice and did a great job. They took their time and were able to make sure we were happy with our nails. Will be back on time. We will be back soon!I love this place. My girlfriend had an appointment with Stephanie and I had her and it. Great service with Stephanie and she was very happy with Stephanie. I got a great service.My husband and he was very happy with Stephanie. Very nice to come back in my husband and she was so sweet and really needed a great with a great and I will get a pediculous and Stephanie is a great with her hair"
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"Yep!!! Lynne absolutely rocks!!! I found Lynne ironically by reading a review for Nois. I purchased a groupon with Nois for two one-hour sessions. After my first session at Nois I had a lot of little bumps that looked like mosquito bites. I wasn't too worried about the bumps, but after a week I had a lot of little scabs. I decided before I went back to Nois that I wanted to try Lynne (she had great reviews), and am I so happy I did. I had an initial consultation where Lynne went into detail about the procedure, what to expect, and why the blend method was best (especially for my curly hair type). She did a free patch test, and to my surprise no little mosquito bites AT ALL, we scheduled our next appointment for a week later, and unlike my procedure at Nois I didn't have ANY scabs -not one. I immediately knew I was in the right hands, and didn't even care about redeeming my other one hour session with Nois. My next session was an hour and we covered a lot of ground. Lynne is very fast and proficient; I was amazed how much hair she was able to treat in an hour. She also has great ""bed side"" manner;  she can keep a casual conversation without slowing down. I've had 3 treatments, and I'm seeing such good results that I'm moving on to a new area next week. She doesn't pressure you at all, this isn't about sales; she genuinely cares and wants her clients to be happy. Here schedule is very accommodating. I am sooooooo happy I found Lynne. Don't waste your time or money going anywhere else. I wish I would have found her years ago. I have tried laser which was extremely painful and ineffective, i'm completely over waxing, shaving, threading, and tweezing every day. If felt so good to look in the mirror a week after a treatment and not have to tweeze or shave the area. Lynne is a rockstar!!! #myelectrolysisisbetterthanyours LOL"
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"This place is AMAZING!!! I've been going to the same nail tech for years and I'm always satisfied. The salon is clean, bright and inviting. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. I have had acrylic nails done here and they always look perfect. This is my new nail salon!I was looking for a place to get my nails done and this place came up so I decided to give it a try. I had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The place is very clean and the service was great. I will definitely be back!I just moved to the area and found this place on yelp. I read some great reviews and decided to try it. I have been to a few other places in the area and this one is the best. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. My nails look great! I will definitely be coming back.Very clean, very well run and relaxing environment. I've been to several nail salons in the area and this is the best one I've been to. I usually go to a certain salon that I trust but have been very satisfied.I've been going here for about a year and I've never had my nails done a good but today.  never had a bad.    and the last time.

Beauty & Spas,3.0,OR,"This is a new affordably-priced massage salon in Farragut. My husband bought a gift certificate for me to have a 1 hour massage at their introductory rate of $39. When I called to schedule my massage, I asked to up the time to an hour and a half massage, which they accommodated after calling the massage therapist to make sure she would stay past her shift ending time. So far, so good.

They were very polite when I arrived, the place was nicely decorated, clean, and the massage room was just like others I've been to. I requested a deep tissue massage (first time I've ever had one) and the massage was great. Here is why i'm giving 2 stars: the massage was supposed to be for 1 hour and a half, which supposedly includes 10 minutes for changing (I assume 5 minutes in the beginning, meaning the massage should start at 5 minutes past the appointment time, and then end with 5 minutes to go). The massage started o time, but with 20 minutes to go, the therapist said ""Time's up!"" and ended the massage. I thought--ok, well, I'll just save money and pay for an hour massage. I go out to pay, and am asked to pay $90 for an hour and a half massage. It took a bit of discussion to explain that while the massage did go about 10 minutes over what an hour massage would have gone, it was 20 minutes shy of what I was being asked to pay for. I agreed to pay $60 (full price--not the first time visit price) for an hour massage when it was offered, I guess to cover for the 10 minutes over an hour massage I did get, but would not go back to this place. I have found Massage Envy to be much more reliable and up-front about their pricing, timing, and type of massage.

Bottom line--massage was great, but make sure you get what you pay for. $30 is a lot of extra money to pay for time you didn't receive."
Beauty & Spas,2.5,CG,"I came here with a group of 3 and we both loved it. The staff was friendly and we had a great conversation. I got a gel manicure and pedicure and it was amazing. I'll definitely be back.I came here for the first time today. The staff was very nice. I was helped immediately and I was taken right away. I received a gel manicure and my nails look amazing. I was happy with my nails and will definitely be returning.I have been to this salon about a dozen times.  I love the service.  They are always very friendly and always have a good time.  The owners are very nice.  It is a very clean and spacious salon.  I have been to several salons and have been disappointed.  My gel manicure last a long time.  I have no complaints about this salon.  I highly recommend it.I have been going to R Salon for a few years now. I have always had a great experience. They are always professional and always do a great job. I always get my eyebrows threaded. The only issue is that they do a little bit of a lot of work on your eyebrows which I have to deal with but they have done. They are always done a great job and it's a great job on my eyebrows. Also they are all around my eyebrows.I love it. Great service. The salon is a great salon!This is the best in the best salon, the best! I am so I love my family owned and very clean and my stylist. I love the best and salon. I have been coming from the best salon and the owners and stylist is a nail salon for hair stylist"
Beauty & Spas,5.0,OR,"If  you have ever thought to yourself, ""I could really use a Thai massage"", this is the place to go. This was my first Thai massage and I am REALLY glad it was with Ang, as she really set a high bar for any other Thai massages I may get in the future. 

Scheduling was really easy and Ang worked with me on a late Friday afternoon appointment. I arrived on time and she was ready to get down to business. The space she has set up is extremely inviting and comfortable. I was instantly relaxed upon walking in. Wear comfortable clothing(I wore yoga pants and a shirt), but I think she has Thai fisherman pants available if you need them. Payment is taken after so don`t worry about that up front. You fill out a form(I selected medium pressure, I believe. I am glad I didn`t opt for FIRM pressure this time. Oh lawdy!) and then you lay down and Ang takes it from there.

This massage was exactly what I needed. I`m a yoga practitioner so I was excited to be twisted and turned and cracked and rubbed down. I seriously felt like the hour was MUCH longer as it was incredibly relaxing and really released every muscle in my body. Light music plays in the background and there is minimal talking, which I LOVE. She really, REALLY got some knots out of my shoulders. It was borderline painful, but in a ""Yes please, I`ll take more of that"" sort of way. Also, she will crack your back with her feet. This feels amazing and is truly a reset on your back. 

After the massage she serves you some lemongrass tea while you do the payment thing(I think it was $60 or so for an hour). I would make it rain on her any day of the week because she is truly skilled at her craft. Go here, get a massage. I was sore the next day and I`m pretty sure there were bruises I couldn`t see. I want to go back ASAP."
Beauty & Spas,3.5,CG,"DO NOT COME HERE or recommend this place. 

I have been going to this location for a year now. The front desk is very friendly and helpful. I always get a massage with Lauren and she is amazing. I am always pleased with the service and the quality of the massage. I have recommended this place to several friends and they have all been very happy with their services. I just went there to get a massage and the experience was great! It's very clean and they provide a relaxing atmosphere. You can tell they really care about their clients. I recommend this place to everyone.I have been going to this location for a while now. I have had a lot of bad haircuts and have tried a few different stylists and I can say that I have finally found my go to salon! I have been going to the same stylist for over 10 years now and have always been very pleased with her work. I have been to several stylists in the area and have always been satisfied with the results. I have been to some of the other stylists that I have been to and they are very friendly and the other stylists seem to be very talented. I have had some of the most of the worst haircuts I have had. I have had received at this location that lasted almost 2 weeks before and this one on my hair cut and left with a ton of my head of my head. I had to a year long hair a half heartbreak and 2 months ago. They charged me. I had to get 3 years of my hair cut. I have been going and it done and the haircut and I went to get a 2 inches off and the 2 inches off of my hair cut."
Beauty & Spas,4.5,OR,"I went to see Seiko to get my hair dyed and she did a great job! She's the best colorist there. I hadn't dyed my hair in almost two years, so I went with the ombré. Loved it! It was a drastic, and at the same time, a subtle change when worn in up. 

The styling assistant was amazing. I don't remember her name, but she was a young girl with short hair and a full sleeve. She was really nice and did my blow dry. 

COOL THING ABOUT THIS PLACE - They do ""dry cuts"" like they dry your hair and then cut it. I've only ever gotten my hair cut while it was wet, but with a dry haircut, you can see exactly where the hair falls and how it looks. 

Everyone I came into contact with was nice to me and respectful. BUT... If I'm paying a minimum of $65 for a blow and cut, shouldn't the stylist be the one doing the work and not give the nice tattooed girl the hardest part? Don't get me wrong, she did an awesome job and talked to me the entire time, got me water, made sure I was comfortable, and was really polite, and the stylist (girl wearing a striped white and yellow shirt in 'photos') just cut my hair and barely spoke to me.

The pricing seemed a bit much. I mean, I don't know how they determine the pricing, but I paid $220 for a cut and dye job - not including tips for the colorist, the girl who cut my hair and the stylist asst. - more than I've ever paid, but I figured that's the trade off when you go to a nice salon instead of Super Cuts. 

Overall, I'll definitely go back to see Seiko for another dye job. The girl that cut my hair didn't do anything extraordinary. She did make my hair feel not as heavy and layered it pretty well, but it wasn't anything special. And Hopefully the stylist assistants there are being recognized for their work."
Beauty & Spas,3.0,CG,I have literally never left a salon disappointed. I love my hair! I just got a trim and the color looks great. I think the place is pretty nice. They offer drinks and snacks. I would recommend it. I was looking for a good salon to go to. I was a bit nervous because I had a lot of high expectations. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. The gentleman who did my nails was super sweet and did a great job! My toes look great and I will definitely be back!I got a gel mani and a pedicure. The technician was very nice and did a great job. I had a full set of acrylics and a gel manicure. The lady who did my nails was very sweet and did a great job. I definitely recommend this place. I have been coming to this salon for about 2 years. I have tried the dip manicures and they have always lasted a good 3 weeks. The owner is very nice and takes pride in her work. She is very personable and she always does a great job. I always come to see her for my pedicures. This place is my new favorite nail salon and they have a great location on the best nail salon. The best in the S. I love the new location next to go to my old location! They have been going to get my nails there. I've been going to the massage and it. This place I always get my nails done here. Everyone is never to come here now my nails and they do my nails and I go there and have been coming and I just get my nails done nails and the pedi. This place from my nails done.
Beauty & Spas,4.0,OR,"I don't usually write reviews but this place is such a great addition to our neighborhood. I happen to walk in to check it out when they first opened and decided to sign up for the Peach Card membership. I'm all for keeping your peach naked, but that can be difficult when good salon/spas charge nearly $100 and the alternative is an unsanitary closet in the back of a nail salon (somehow STILL about $60!). With the Peach Card I get a free Brazilian each month plus discounts on all other services. you can't beat it. So I decided to give it a try and now I am hooked on so many of their other services. This place is cute, clean, very affordable, and they have always been genuinely nice.

Before the Naked Peach, I had never tried other areas of hair removal and I was definitely missing out. I am now regularly doing Brazilian, eyebrow, leg, and underarm. I was nervous at first to have to grow out the leg and underarm for the initial wax, but I am glad I bit the bullet. The hair on both now grows in super fine and seems lighter, no more nasty stubble. I've also tried the facial and that was so nice and relaxing. Sarah is very knowledgable and if it seems like she's pushing product, it's because she knows so many of the products we use are harsh and damaging. Oh and the airbrush tan is so great if you just want a natural, beautiful glow and not the Snooki effect.

I've read some of the complaints in the other reviews and I think it's important to remember that they are a new business and they are working out the kinks. Sarah is the owner and she is so dedicated to making sure everyone has an enjoyable experience. If something is less than perfect, tell her. She has always gone above and beyond to fix it next time.

I have recommended them to all of my friends. I want to see them succeed because it's a great concept run by great women."
