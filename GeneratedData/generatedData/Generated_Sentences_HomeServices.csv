Home Services,3.0,OR,"Top drawer company from the sales representative, Steve Dover, to their pricing & installation team.  We bought the two-stage 17 Seer Trane compressor & pared it with Trane's variable speed Airhandler, & their electronic air purification system.

Don't be fooled .... find a different place."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"No show and no call. Sounds familiar like one of the other people. Don't use the guys. Also, they go by another name which is R&R.

A lil bit more than most but excellent."

Home Services,2.0,OR,Living here is worse than living in college dorms. The hallways are dirty with puke and dog poop that residents do not clean after themselves or their pets. Most of the residents are entitled college kids who are loud and have parties regardless of who they bother. Management needs to do better in terms of cleaning and keeping the noise down. Do not recommend living here to anyone.

Update :  After posting a review on google, John himself showed up at my front door with the glass. The glass is great , too bad I still could never recommend his services."
Home Services,3.0,OR,Please don't use them as a Property Management company.  They are non-responsive and not organized at all.  They don't have reliable vendors and do not have the property owner best interest.  They will do repairs and you won't find out until you get your statement.  You can never get in touch with the owners and it is a terrible experience.  Please think twice before picking them.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I enjoyed working with Alisa on my condo purchase. She was easy to get along with, considerate of my needs, particularly as someone with a limited budget, and she was always available and responsive. She didn't pressure me into making a purchase. She seemed more concerned with finding a place that was right for me. Overall, I would work with her again, and I'd feel comfortable recommending her to my friends."
Home Services,2.5,OR,came out and looked at why the a/c was not working. told me I needed a new unit even though mine was only a couple of years old. i called another company and all it was was a blown fuse. the final indignity was they changed my filter with one that I had purchased and charged me $50 for the 1min of time. THESE GUYS ARE SHYSTERS. DO NOT USE THEM.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"This place was amazing. The atmosphere of the shared space is like a cozy coffee shop without all the distractions. There are also several different kinds of work areas ranging from sofas, small tables, large tables, bean bag like seats (more like cushioned balls), and large floor pillows. There is also private space available if needed. I highly recommend visiting here especially if you would like a productive area to work."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"The three movers we worked with were professional, polite and hardworking. They took care moving our furniture and our things and even placed the labeled boxes in the right rooms. The move itself was very smooth and easy. They quoted the rates upfront and were very clear about everything at the outset. I highly recommend them and would try to get them to work with me if I had another move."
Home Services,4.0,OR,I live in my childhood home. I use Matheny Heating & Cooling because our family has used them for at least 30 years. I have a maintenance contract with Matheny so my Furnace and A/C are serviced annually. I've never needed a repair because they keep them in excellent condition. The Repair Techs are knowledgeable and professional. The customer service is excellent. They are always on time. I highly recommend Matheny.
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Turns out, the dude gave me a busted cable box. Later, when a tech came out with a new box, he called the guy who had showed up during the snow storm and thanked him for doing a half-assed job. I take back what I've said about Comcast. If they didn't give me free stuff and credit my account with every complaint I make, I would be watching TV through Fios."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Price gougers!!!  They charged me $1300.00 to replace a AC coil that was covered under warranty on my less than 5 year old ac unit that they installed for me. It took 2 1/2 hours to replace the part. That's $520,00 an hour for labor. What a disgrace!  They should be ashamed!  I understand people should get paid for their expertise and knowledge but this is so wrong."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Probably the most incompetent, disgusting company I've ever dealt with.
Called for a price quote installing impact windows in my home. The female representative stated both my wife and me must be present for price quote...I told the female my wife is terminally ill with cancer and may not be  available at the time of presentation. They ""refused"" to give me a price quote. I was floored and hung up..Disgusting people.."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"the nastiest people i've ever had to deal with.  they called me out of the blue and were super rude from the get go (including the owner).  I got them paid by the insurance company (they did the work), but they need to wake up.  I actually feel sorry for them, they live sad little pathetic lives....it's really the only reason I can think of....maybe self esteem issues?"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I called this company for a estimate, a female that answered the phone was rude and disrespectful,later I found on my written estimate copy a note she had written, I felt  hurt and disrespected like a customer at a restaurant after reading a hurtful comment written by a waitress on a receipt.The guy that gave me an estimate was a great guy.It's sad that some people hurt their own companies."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Meurer Brothers arrived on time to trim 5 large trees in our yard. Excellent crew. Excellent service. They have the equipment and knowledge to do the job efficiently and correctly. At the very least have them come, survey your needs and give you a quote. We found their quote was a lot lower and the quality of service was higher than the other companies we had come over."
Home Services,3.5,CG,I knew my garage door would break and the door would need to be replaced.

Home Services,4.0,CG,Came to Bayfront to have a new AC system installed. I was told that my AC was not working.  I had to replace the AC and then the installers had to come back to install it.  It was a total nightmare.  I called and spoke to two technicians who said they would be here for a few days and would be here
Home Services,3.5,CG,They sent 2 men to look at the problem and they did a great job. I would recommend them to anyone. I will definitely use them again if I have any other plumbing issues. Update:  I am very pleased with the service provided by the owner. He is a gentleman and very responsive to my requests.
Home Services,4.0,CG,What an arrogant jerk.  We have had an awful experience with them.  They have been rude to us and we had to leave our home and then have to call them back.  We had to call them back in the middle of the night.  This is the worst experience I have had with a realtor.  I will never use them again
Home Services,2.5,CG,We have had nothing but issues with the system and they are now going to have to move the entire building from the West to the East.  The windows are not working properly and it's causing a lot of issues in the heat.  There are also several leaks in the kitchen that we haven't seen in a long time and they are getting worse and worse

We called the company and they said they would call me

They also did an excellent job installing our new roof"
Home Services,4.0,OR,A & E carpet put down my new hardwood floor and I love it.  The work was done professionally and in a timely fashion.

Great place to for your flooring needs.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Outstanding company.  Their proposals were detailed, included photographs, and they met with me to review them and answer my many questions.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"We have stayed in many Marriott's and this is a great one. We stayed in the 2 room suite which was more than enough room for 5 people. The room seemed new and very clean. Room was equipped with a stove, oven, refrigerator, and microwave. Breakfast is a little lacking but consistent with a TownPlace. The hospitality is extraordinary and they really take care of you if you are a rewards member"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"My mother met with Megan and had her work up a design for 5 closets.  After additional thought, we wanted to change a few things.  Megan stopped by this morning and quick as a wink, she made the changes and my mother was more than happy.  Megan is personable, efficient and a joy to work with.  I only wish I lived closer so she could design my closets!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"They were the best! Two gents came up to Truckee within a few days of me calling about my garage door, that no longer opened or closed. They quickly replaced a broken part on my door and continued to give the entire thing a tune-up. Affordable, professional, detail-oriented and efficient. My garage door never worked that well before they fixed it. It's so smooth and quiet now. Thank you D & D!"

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Huge fan!!  I had originally hired another company to come out change my locks and they neglected to show up - so after waiting and waiting I finally called ABC Lock and Key instead.  They came out on time (even a little early) and completed the work quickly and for a great rate. 

I wish I had saved myself the time and called ABC originally.  I recommend their services."
Home Services,3.5,OR,Wow! Great service. Hugo fixed my bad light switch in no time. Took a while to get an appointment due to the virus leaving them short handed but he came when he said he would and called with an update of his arrival. It was worth the wait.  He was ontime and efficient. I will use them anytime I need an electrician in the future. Thank you Hugo and Sharp Electric.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Tech didnt give receipt, told they would email that night, next morning told they so busy didnt have time to email. Tech wanted to take door panels and ignition out even though registration has vin, after disassembling door panel he figured it would be easier to use vin. Duh and much faster as I was on the clock and needed to get back to work myself. Just didnt go smooth at all."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Do not use them! Spend the extra money and use PODS. Scheduled an out by owner today and they reassured me by pod would be here and that I'd have from 9-5 to get my contents, except I got to the Cherry Hill, NJ location and my pod wasn't set out, no one is here and there are now 4 customers waiting wondering what is going on. Absolute sham and incredibly frustrating..."
Home Services,1.5,OR,Because my lowest option here is 1 star in reality it would be -100 stars. People they have managing these buildings have no idea about how to treat tenants and or getting anything done in a logical way. They think they get paid just to cut the grass and sweep (once a week if we are lucky). NO SORRY YOU ALSO HAVE TO HELP TENANTS WITH ISSUES AND PROBLEMS WITH THE BUILDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We had Brad come and disconnect our sink/garbage disposal/dishwasher then reconnect after our countertops went in.  Service was very professional and efficient and Brad did a great job and was very courteous.   Even when calling to pay, I spoke with a woman, Nichole I believe, who was very friendly and provided great service. 

Overall quality of the work and personal were great and price was fair - highly recommended!"

They were very honest and thorough.  They were able to make the entire process seamless.  The staff was great.  They were quick to respond and did a great job.
Home Services,2.5,CG,"I beg to differ. I asked for the receipt and they said it was for a small order and we would be fine. The technician, Eric, then said we needed to call him again. He came out and said we would be charged for the rest of the work. I called again and said we would call him again and he would tell me how much it"
Home Services,4.5,CG,Absolutely AMAZING housecleaning service. I had an AC system running in the basement and my furnace was leaking and we had to call the office.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"DITTO!!!!
Not surprised to see the other disparaging review regarding Lawn Pride... We own rental property in Westfield and were trying to insure the lawn was well maintained by using lawn pride for 5 years.... We did not appreciate all the sales calls and hysterics to try and get us to add services, but the RUDE receptionist Heather was the final straw... Culminating in our terminating services with LP...  And Heather retorting, ""fine""."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Carpinteria Lock & Key was amazing. They worked to the best of their ability and gave their greatest effort to find a lock for a very, very old piece of furniture. Although we were unable to find a correct key for the lock, they spent several hours working on it and did not charge me. I have never had that happen before. They provided great service, and I would highly recommend their services."
Home Services,4.0,OR,I've used Aall Bright several times to clean my pool deck and screen cage. They show up on time and get the job done efficiently and thoroughly. I do not have to monitor them. The price is always what they quoted up front. Communication is easy because their website tells you what to do to prepare and they text details. I will continue to use them and recommend them to other Yelp users.
Home Services,3.0,OR,"After having a less than satisfying experience with the cleaning of my home, I have had a complete turn-around in my opinion of this company. I received an immediate call from the owner of Brighthouse with an apology, an explanation, (not an excuse), a full refund and a personal guarantee regarding future cleanings. Anyone who stands behind their work/company like this person deserves another chance. I will be calling them in the future."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Suburban Solutions recently helped move my college aged son out of his apartment in Philly. They were punctual, polite, and professional! The apartment was a mess and my son had not done any packing. They came in, packed, navigated the narrow hallways and stairs and efficiently loaded the truck staying positive and upbeat the entire time. They delivered everything in tact without damage. I highly recommend them for your packing and moving needs"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"These guys came out to replace my outdated and non functional heater and ac unit. They were very quick to respond, super professional and informative, as well as being the most reasonably priced that I found. My technicians were Ernie, Nate, and Caleb. I couldn't be happier with the service and results. I don't expect to have any HVAC issues soon but if I do I would call these guys again. Highly recommended."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Love all the work they've done, from removing and replacing lighting for my Reno, exchanging switch plates from old and yellow to white to match walls, adding dimmers, and installing electrical in my kitchen island. Jason, Josh, and Sebastian have truly been a pleasure to work with. I know I'll need them again in the future and have their number saved! Additionally, their price beat the other proposals in spades. I highly recommend."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I needed to get my gel nails dipped again so they sat me down and I soaked my nails as they were working on other girls. They took my nails off, painless. I love how they pay attention to any ingrown nails or hang nails. My pedicure was relaxing and clean. Same for my nails, she got right to work and shaped them exactly how I wanted them. I will be going back!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,This is the second time Mark and his team have painted my house. They are very professional and do a wonderful job! We are so happy with how our basement came out especially with all the photos I showed him from Pinterest. He was able to replicate the same work I wanted. Not only did they paint but he did wrap my poles and paint them as well as repairing some areas too!
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Took nearly 6 months of calling to get a representative on the phone to establish home pickup.  Have been promised delivery of cans on 3 different days, still no cans, no concise answer from them on when I will have my cans
Even after they called ME on 1/4 to inform me that the cans WOULD be delivered that day, still no cans, now state MAYBE Friday, but they were unwilling to commit."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"After trying my insect control company (excellent for bugs, but pricey for animals), buying online traps and poison to do it myself, I'm so grateful a friend referred me to Dave the Trapper Guy. After casing my attic, the grounds, he knew exactly what to do. Priced fairly, and miracle of miracles, all squirrels gone now. Sleeping soundly after a month of scratching above the ceiling."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I'm not a BoA customer, but the few times I've been here with those who are, it's been pleasant.  Walk-up and drive-thru ATMs are close to the main street with the actual branch set back a bit.  Friendly staff as well...I guess considering it's so close to Vanderbilt, if you did open your account outside of TN, there are different slips to get from the teller, which I've never encountered before."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I have rented from Ivy Apartments in the past and am currently leasing with them now. Out of all of the apartments I've lived in in Santa Barbara, Ivy apartments has been the most accommodating and proactive company to rent with. The maintenance team is awesome and fulfills requests almost immediately and Matt made sure my leasing process was made smooth and easy. Overall, I really couldn't ask for a better rental company!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Since John came to our house and tinted the three west facing windows in our home office, bathroom and daughters bedroom, our house has been much cooler and we are saving an average of 20% on our power bill! The savings have more than paid for the tint, so much so that we had John come out and do the south facing windows at our business with the same results! Thanks Tint Visions!"
Home Services,1.0,OR,I wish I had written this review sooner. I will NEVER buy a voucher of any sort for One Stop Cleaning. I bought mine from Living Social and I lost my money because they NEVER called me back after I emailed AND left a voicemail numerous times. I want to take them to the Better Business Bureau since I now lost $40. Never ever trust these people. Waster of time and pure robbers.
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Let me add to Marty L's review.  Very poor customer service; the guy on the phone was rude and abrupt.  I called to inquire about a home I found on trulia.com.  When I asked one too many questions regarding membership and member limitations, he hung up!  Go somewhere else for your housing needs; this guy is not serious enough about his business to treat potential customers with any consideration."
Home Services,1.0,CG,The worst company in the area. The only reason I've left a review is because I'm a self-employed woman and I am upset that they have not offered to take care of my issues.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Langenwalter does the best carpet cleaning ever.  I was considering replacing my carpet, but after their thorough cleaning, the carpets looked nice enough to keep.  I was amazed that they were able to remove a large red candle wax stain from a cream-colored carpet. Their technician was personable and efficient.  I will never choose another carpet cleaning company.  I consider it an investment to have my carpets cleaned every year."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Even when I didnt got the chance to use their service yet, because of the miscommunication that the receptionist made on my cancelled appointment, Shay the owner just called me and apologize for the mistakes that made by the receptionist, he did try his best to help me and even offered a big discount to make it up. He even told me the way to save more money, he's been very respectful and helpful."

Home Services,3.0,OR,Sorry I can't leave zero stars. They have no idea what they're doing.  The plumber was here for 3 hours but couldn't clear the drain. He said he didn't have the right equipment. Now why wouldn't he bring the right equipment?  He said he went down 75 feet. Liar!  Another plumber came and found the problem in 30 feet.  They are good at sending the bill though. Avoid these guys.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"HouseMaster Home Inspections is by far the most outstanding inspection company I have ever dealt with.  I knew I was in expert hands after taking to Michelle Craft on the phone.  Randall Watts was the inspector, and he was as good as it gets.  Professional, friendly, reliable, detail-oriented, and my list goes on.  My highest praise to HouseMaster Home Inspections, and anyone who knows me, knows I am a perfectionist!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Great folks. Got top of line system for my house well. Matt help selected system. I did lots of research and this guys where best and cheapest too. Had littl problem two months later but they fix it in no time and added extra filter with no extra charge. Water is great now. Don't waiste your time with getting 5 estimates , just go straight to this folks and be done! Highly recommend ."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Three years ago I purchased an a/c from Encore. Works great. Next winter, had no heat. Encore told me I needed new gas furnace. Another contractor charged me $170 to tell me it needed $400 fix. Still didn't work. Three years and a couple of space heaters later, through a home warranty, another contractor told me Encore installed wrong type of thermostat and now I have heat. Three years with no heat. Thanks Encore."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"If you live in Center City Philadelphia,  don't use this company!  They show up, say they can't find parking,  and leave... rescheduling 8 days later,  and do the same thing again twice now.  I even offered to pay for a garage .25 miles away,  which they rejected.  Said i was responsible for getting  them parking within half a block. Clearly not able to service city residents!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Best Price Movers was a dream to work with! Moving is so stressful, that was definitely the best moving experience I've ever had. The crew (John, Steven and mike) arrived on time, they were very pleasant and extremely fast. They didn't take any brakes and moved my entire 3rd floor apartment in less than 3 hours! My furniture was well protected. Extremely professionals at a great price. I couldn't ask for more, thank you!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Great experience with Clearview!!!   I am a really busy self-employed business person.  I rescheduled twice.  Cyle was understanding and professional.  Had the work done today.  Cyle was all smiles and very friendly.  I drive a high end vehicle and am particular about how it is serviced. 

I recommend Clearview.  Ask for Cyle.  But be better than I and keep your appointments.

Super Job!!!

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Every positive thing in the other reviews is true. I didn't even shop around, because, as stated in other reviews, I got a response within an hour, AFTER 10pm. I needed an appt ASAP, and Billy was able to accommodate everyone's schedules. Even though he said it was one of the best houses he'd inspected in the area, he found a few things that the home owner agreed to fix for us."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"The 2 gentleman who performed the service were very nice and got the job done. I was not impressed with the clean-up though. Left a big smelly mess for me to clean up at 10:30 at night under my sink, all over my stove, cabinets and under the sink. In my opinion it was expensive for cleaning out just the one pipe. For what I was charged they should have done the upstairs too!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Called another company first on recommendation of a good friend. After 5 days and 2 calls to them and still no return call to schedule an appointment, I decided to consult Yelp for who to call next. These guys have all 5 star reviews for a reason. They were prompt, courteous, and reasonably priced. If I could add a 6th star, I would. A local company with genuinely great people doing genuinely great work!"

Home Services,3.5,CG,Terrible customer service. We had an emergency emergency and they did nothing. They would not call us back. The office staff is also very rude and not helpful. We had a gutted kitchen sink and a broken shower door. I had to call them again. They said they could come out and fix the problem.
Home Services,1.5,CG,"At first I had high hopes for the move, but I didn't feel like I was getting the job done.  The house was a mess and the crew was so great.  The only thing I can say is that I am extremely pleased with the service and the quality of the work.  I will definitely use them again in the future.I had to call them"
Home Services,5.0,CG,"McBrien Contracting did a great job on the job and they did a great job on the move. They did an excellent job installing the new roof and then the installers showed up and did a great job.

Home Services,4.0,CG,I can't say enough positive things about the guys at Reno Roofing. They were very thorough and thorough. They had a lot of information and they were very honest. They were able to go over my roof and fixed a few issues that were not covered by our warranty. The guys were extremely professional and very quick to respond to any questions.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"They came at the time that we arranged. Put a drop cloth down, wore a mask (Covid era review) and checked the chimney from the top and the bottom. Very personable guy. He said he wasn't going to charge me because it was in good shape and an easy job. I picked him because he had good reviews and now I can see why. This is the kind of service that keeps a business around."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We contacted Nash Painting to provide a quote on painting our shop.
Bill came out and walked through every detail, asking questions, offering suggestions and being completely sure he understood our expectations.
His quote was very good and comparable to others we recieved.
They started the job and completed the job in a very quick period of time. Very neat, very courteous, very good at follow up.
I will use them again in the future, they are very good."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"The Fence Factory management and workers exceeded my expectations. The work was done on site by friendly and careful workers. They all worked hard to please me and my various requests. The didn't rush but came every day until the work was finished. They were creative in their approach to the work. The fence is very sturdy and I'm very pleased with the results. Many thanks for Grant, Guillermo and Rafael for a pleasant experience."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"I have never been cursed at and yelled at by a company. This is also my first time getting bait and switched. 

My quote was $2200. Once they had my stuff on a truck they said it would be  $6100. They are unresponsive. 

It's basically a ""legal scam."" Without a doubt, this is the worst experience I've had with a company and I feel so bad for all the people they are praying upon."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"The Water department claimed I had a leak underground right in front of my house, which was a error. Mr. Graciano came out to my West Philly property, to see exactly what my plumbing issue was. My pipes were a bit old & I needed a new Faucet in the kitchen & bathroom. Awesome work, reasonable price, would recommend this plumber to anyone in need of any minor or major plumbing issue."

He put in a kitchen faucet that was too short nubs and we had water leaking from the kitchen faucet into our basement for two weeks until we discovered it by the smell .

I would not let these in my house . If I could give zero stars I would"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"My husband and I really enjoyed working with Seamus to design a 1st floor media room, bedroom, bathroom, hallway and stairwell. He helped us think through the potential for the space and how we wanted to use it. He came up with multiple options for creating as much useful storage space as possible. His drawing was invaluable when we began the build-out. It was super helpful when communicating with our GC and even the plumber."
Home Services,5.0,OR,We continue to work with Eric on an as needed basis. Its so nice to be able to call when a new obstacle with our lab presents itself or a needed refresher. He is happy to schedule a meeting or if its simple just offer some quick guidance. Our lab loves him and honestly is such a pleasure to live with that I can't recommend Eric highly enough.
Home Services,4.0,OR,I hired this company to paint my mothers basement. He gave me a hand written quote. I accepted his offer for the basement job. He then called me and asked to start the next day stating that his outside job was canceled due to rain. He arrived the next day and Called me from her house stating that he underbid the job. I found this to be extremely unprofessional. He walked out with his crew
Home Services,4.5,OR,"You cannot beat this service. First of all Eric is an incredibly nice guy. He called about an hour before he was supposed to show up and then showed up on-time. The work they did was dirty but they did it without complaint and did a fantastic job cleaning out random things from my basement (an old dryer, refrigerator as well as debris that I accumulated throughout the years). Definitely recommend and will use again."
Home Services,3.5,OR,Emmon's came highly recommended and they certainly lived up to the recommendation. The price was reasonable and everything from the initial sales call (Ken) was done in a courteous and professional manner. The Owens Corning product and warranty was a strong feature. The complete installation was accomplished in one day and they had an on-site foreman (Tom) who oversaw the process. The cleanup was complete and the roof looks great! I would highly recommend Emmon's.
Home Services,4.0,OR,Showed up this morning about 9 o'clock. Thought I give this place a try I just needed a title switched over in my name I was told since it HAD been raining their owner did not require them to do a level one inspection. Therefore they would not be able to help me. I mean the ground is wet so that is an excuse not to offer a service? Lol seriously? I won't be back....

Home Services,4.0,CG,"Queen of Clean is a real gem and the only reason I chose her is because I was just blown away by the crew's professionalism, their professionalism, and their customer service.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"Giving them a 1star rating only because 0 is not an option. I paid for a one time clean ($120.00) plus a move in/out ($60.00). I was under time restraints so felt this should take care of everything. Not even close!  2 people spent 1/2 hr in a small suite and barely made a mark. 
It was brand new when moved into 6 months ago so should have been a breeze for the amount paid"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I HIGHLY recommend Better Day Movers for both packing and moving! They packed my entire 3 bedroom house in one day. The boxes were packed carefully, efficiently, and labeled accurately which made unpacking so much easier. Both the moving crew and the packing crew were so kind and easy to work with.  I've recommended this company to numerous friends as the need arises, and will continue to do so.  Thank you Eric and team!"

Home Services,3.5,OR,As a REALTOR in the area my top priority is knowing my clients are in trusted hands for all their needed services through their home purchase or sale. Metro East consistently delivers on this need! My clients continually tell me they are very happy with the service they receive during the home inspection process. The reports are always delivered quickly after inspection and are consistently clear and easy to interpret. Thank you to the whole team!
Home Services,3.5,OR,"ARRY'S completed the installation of a new roof on our home in June 2021 exhibiting true excellence through the entire process. I mean from the first meeting with their representative CHRIS, through the delivery of cookies a few weeks after the process came to an end, that being a simple ""statement"" of their appreciation for being selected to perform the work. The customers that hire them should expect a ""Best In The Business"" type of result!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Wonderful service. We highly recommend  him. He answered our call right before closing at 7 pm. He arrived the next day on time, in fact a little early, he also called before arrival. He had everything gone in less than an hour and swept up, leaving the yard in perfect condition. We highly recommended him. He is local and we like to use local, small businesses. Use his service, you will be happy you did."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"On time, prompt, fast & efficient movers. Would recommend again to anyone. 

My only concern, is they charged me more when 3 guys showed up rather than 2 I requested.  A bit of a surprise and was stuck in a position where I had to go with the higher rate.  Also, informed me my mirror was lightly broken; in reality it was completely broken and no one has followed up to make any claims."
Home Services,4.5,OR,Varga and his team are amazing! We had a very odd flooring choice in our house - engineered maple. All sorts of knots and color variations we locked but they were worn out. Varga's team blended in new wood where walls were knocked out. They refinished the floors to a matte white-wash blend and they turned out fabulous! They were in and out in a few short days! Extremely precise and courteous! I would highly recommend!
Home Services,4.5,OR,"My husband and I had a very positive experience working with Allen and his team. While planning to relocate from California, Allen went above and beyond to show us around the city and introduce us to all that Nashville has to offer. He also thoroughly guided us through each step of the process of buying our new home. We valued and trusted his in depth knowledge of the real estate market and would highly recommend him!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"This is a scam. They got me with a Groupon but added a ton of additional fees and then overcharged me. The movers went on a lunch break and they charged me for this as well. I tried to call to resolve the issue but the manager is never around and no one else can help. They act like it is normal to pay $600 to move a 1 bedroom apartment, 0. 09 miles away."
Home Services,5.0,OR,My elderly in-law needed service on a Sunday because she has a serious medical condition and they said they would go check on the problem for no extra fee.

Jay and Jacob took all the damaged and soaking wet duct work away and there was a whole trailer full!
Home Services,1.5,OR,"WARNING!!! DO NOT USE!! THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS! We made them aware we would be using American Express as payment. They even charged us an additional $150 service fee to use AMEX. After our furniture got to their warehouse they called to inform us that they were ripping up the contract and they were only accepting cash for delivery of our furniture to Atlanta. Now they are holding our belongings for ransom. 
I REPEAT-DO NOT USE"
Home Services,3.0,OR,Highly recommend.  The owner came out and was timely with the bid.  He was also timely with email correspondence.  We were installing during the late spring and had some concerns/issues regarding weather and a scheduled pool opening.  Steve and his crew come out on a Sunday to remove the existing fence and had the new fence up as scheduled.  Very professional and went above and beyond to satisfy my time schedule.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Seriously? I think these guys are the poster children for all plumbers, Lazy. I called them for service and they said they wouldn't even drive 2 miles from where they ""hang out on St Pete Beach"". If they won't even make this small effort to make money and earn business I'd hate to see what kind of plumbing work they do. I'd pass on these guys. Or they may even pass on you when you call."
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Customer service staff is very nice and professional. We've had a lot of problems with them. If we had a house, they would get the job done in a timely manner.

Home Services,4.0,CG,"do not use this window manager. The only reason I did not use this window manager was because they did not have the best experience with their customers. The manager, James, is a nice guy and is friendly. He even took a picture of my phone with me to show me the window and gave me a discount on the phone call. 

I would definitely recommend this company"
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Chris and Cody are fantastic!  The guys were very professional and polite, and the guys were very knowledgeable and helpful.

Home Services,3.5,CG,"They truly are experts and are an absolute pleasure to work with. Thank you!Very disappointed. We had an old dishwasher, a small refrigerator, and a new dishwasher.

Home Services,5.0,CG,"Mario, Rudy, and his team are amazing!  We just moved in and they were the best!  We are so happy to have found them and they have been our go to guys!  Thank you so much Rudy!

I would definitely recommend this"
Home Services,3.0,CG,Our washer shut down on time and the AC was in good working order. The guy came out to fix the problem and the house was cleaned up by the next morning. The AC was now working again and everything is in good working order. I would definitely recommend this company.Great service!  They sent out a technician to fix a problem and we had a very happy experience!
Home Services,1.5,CG,I went to their office and asked them to re-install a new heater for the chimney. They said they had to replace a valve and then the valve was not working. I called to speak to someone else and they said they would be happy to come to my house and fix the problem. I called again to the office and they said they had to replace a valve and then
Home Services,4.5,CG,I've had these gents move here for the last two years and it's always a pleasure to see their work. The crew is always up to date and the maintenance guys are always very polite and helpful. I highly recommend them. I would highly recommend them. I highly recommend you to everyone you know.I had a leaking pipe in my attic and I called on Monday to come
Home Services,1.5,CG,"I've tried for two days now to get an estimate. I'm not happy with the estimate and am contacting them.  The office staff is very rude, and the first call I made was to the office manager.  She said she was working on it and wouldn't be coming back until after the 2nd day.  I called the office manager and she said she was working"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"I wrote a review on here. The owner, Jeremy, emailed me yesterday morning asking if he could schedule an appointment. The office manager, Heather, emailed me today to confirm.

Home Services,1.0,CG,"Was supposed to be moving this week, but we decided to move on Monday. I was told we would be late. The office staff was very polite, and even took a look at our issues. We were told we would be charged for one hour. This is a joke. The office staff was very rude, and the most annoying part was the fact that we had to pay $"
Home Services,2.0,CG,I live in their building and have been living here for two years.  The building is pretty quiet and well maintained.  The staff is friendly and the building is nice to stay in.  The parking is convenient and the staff is very knowledgeable.  I highly recommend this property for anyone looking to rent in Philadelphia.I hired them to clean my house on my first day of moving
Home Services,3.0,OR,"These guys know their stuff. As an owner, its important to me that I've got someone to trust and that's efficient with their processes. Trevor and his crew send statements on time. Handle maintenance quickly and I don't hear much excuses. I've had one or two issues come up, but they jumped right on it after a couple of emails. I'd recommend them if you need someone to watch your investment like it was theirs. Good company."
Home Services,3.0,OR,We used these guys awhile ago for Furnace cleaning. I have to agree with alot of the reviewers here. The initial price from the Groupon is nowhere near the price you end up paying. Its definitely deceiving to think you are buy a package and find out once they get here that there is this additional charge and another and another. The work they did seemed fine but I don't like how they aren't transparent with pricing.
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I chose Carrollwood Windows and Doors based on a neighbor's recommendation and of course my own research. I hit a home run in this choice.

I replaced my over 27 year old windows with PGT winyguard single hung impact windows.

Great choice. Great noise reduction, and no more drafts. My electric bill is going down. I'm happy.

Their in house installers are great professionals. Their customer service top notch.

If your in the market for new windows I highly recommend them."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"My daughter had an emergency plumbing issue on a house she recently purchased and called Pink Plumber on a Saturday night. The tech that arrived was a jerk and quoted her $800 to fix the problems (plus $50 service call).   
The next morning she called Roto Rooter. The difference was night and day! The Roto Rooter Technician was very nice and completed the job for $460. I would never recommend anyone call the Pink Plumber!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We hired Elite Construction to build 4 custom pergolas in our backyard.  Jerry provided 3D renderings to show us what it would look like before we started.   Everything they did was very detailed and the construction was top workmanship.  The result was better than I had envisioned.  They charge a fair price, show up when they say they will and leave your property clean.  I highly recommend Jerry and Elite Construction."
Home Services,2.5,OR,We had a great experience. Jefferson was on time picking up 2 storage cube units that a friend was giving me prior to her move. I received multiple texts keeping me apprised of his progress and was able to meet him upon arrival at my apt building with a cart. The pricing was very reasonable and we would definitely use this service again. Thanks for making it easy to move things without imposing on friends and family.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I have used Lennys 2x. They have saved me thousands of dollars with alternative solutions. I appreciate them more than they could understand. Both times I was told they wouldn't be able to come for a couple of days and both times they called the same day and said they were in my neighborhood and could see if it was a quick fix. These guys are honest, responsive and compassionate. I won't hesitate to call them again."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Big Time.  Herb and Nancy do a great job.  I sold my home and needed new screens and frames fabricated and replaced for the new buyers.  Herb drove out and gave us a great quote.  Lets do it, we said..  He took measurements and had them repaired and rebuilt in only a few days.  I could not be more happy with the quality and price.  Great people-  great job."
Home Services,5.0,OR,We needed a special plumber to fix a urinal. Not an ordinary house toilet!  Gary's scheduled a time for the next day. There was a wide window for their job but they worked with me and my busy schedule to call me on the way. He educated me on how urinal flush valves work. The repair fixed the issue and was reasonably priced. (Urinals are pricey). I will use them again for future complicated plumbing needs.
Home Services,3.0,OR,My senior citizen mother had this company come out and service her locks and they stole her 2 locks leaving her vulnerable. We have called them a number of times they will not call back. I have gone to the police dept. and file a claim against them for theft. Ethen put in the lock. I think it's a shame when you have to steal from a senior citizen. They do not need to be in business.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Joe saved me!  I had a major clog in the main line that stopped up all of the drains in the house.  No warning, just boom, no more water until it was fixed.  That's what you get with cast iron pipes   They sent Joe out the same day I called and he took care of everything.  They didn't even charge an emergency service fee.  I'm very happy with Lewis Plumbing."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"By far the worst business in Santa Barbara. Measured all angles of my fire place to order a screen. They took the measurements and ordered me the wrong size screen. Over charged me for the screen then refused to return the item that they wrongfully ordered. I then had to order online with the same measurements and got the right size from another company who charged me half the price. This place is a joke, stay clear!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"You can certainly find a cheaper painter, but you get what you pay for.  Pete and his team are absolutely one of the best in town when it comes to knowing their products and delivering a quality paint job that will last!

Home Services,5.0,OR,"I have used this service several times. Easy to set up an appointment. Each time I have used them, they call about 30 minutes before arrival. The people that have come to my place have always been friendly and very courteous. They did all of the work, I just had to show them what was going. Their dependability and reasonable rates make them the first place I would contact for any kind of removal, business or residential."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"my window pane broke, one of those little french four panel windows. jeff was able to cut the glass to fit and fix it with no problem, even with all the rain we've been having lately. didn't even let my cats out either, they're window sitters. he also left behind two more panels of the same size glass. 10/10 great customer service, nice guy, and great work! will def use him again for any other fixing needs!"

Home Services,4.5,CG,I had Quality Roofing install a new AC system and they did a great job. I would recommend them highly.I had a house inspection done by the HVAC company.  The inspector came out and told me that the water heater was working fine.  He stated that they would call me back to come back to the house and make sure the water heater was working properly. 
Home Services,2.0,CG,Called to have my ac unit replaced and the technician was very professional. He did a thorough job. He explained the problem and the cost. He then provided a quote.

Home Services,3.5,CG,"Daniel cuts corners and I find it difficult to find a good manager. When I asked him about the other two employees, he said, ""they're the worst."" He was very rude and condescending. 

He said, ""I'm going to call you back."" I said, ""I'll call you back."" He said, ""I don't know how you're going"
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Highly recommend Aaron! He was prompt, professional and very knowledgeable.  We had a very difficult time getting a move done.  We were very happy with the work he did.

Home Services,3.5,CG,"Hands down the best plumbing company in the area!  I will definitely recommend them!Very disappointed. We had an old dishwasher, a small refrigerator, and a new dishwasher.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Had them come out to look at the installation by another company and try and figure out why our electric bill was so high.. within 45 minutes, the tech was able to figure out the previous company never turned on our new heat pump and was able to configure the system perfectly...

Very well done on service.. no only was he early, he figured out something that was overlooked by at least 12 diffferent visits by the installing company."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Purchased a groupon and then saw the other reviews afterwards. Was definitely concerned at first, but scheduling was no problem at all and they came out the next day. The cleaning was well done and very thorough. The person doing the cleaning was courteous and did a great job. The carpets look great!  He was able to get out 2 stains that had been there for years as well."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"If I could give 0 starts I would. Frontier is the worst internet/cable provider possible. I will never use them for service ever again. Their customer service is terrible. After moving and having to cancel, the process was so complicated when it shouldn't have been. There is no communication between the workers when notes and details should be made in the computer. The operators are rude. Every single encounter I've had with Frontier has been a negative one."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"You will not be disappointed. Requested a quote to have my toilet repaired, not only did he respond quickly to my request, but also scheduled an appointment for the next day to complete the repair, which was a Sunday. Upon arriving he was pleasant, professional and quick. And I didn't feel I was being taken advantage of with the price.  So far, so good and I definitely plan to use him for other future  household projects."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Excellent service. Darren, Steve and their team came to our house several times to make sure we had the right plan for our large stone colonial in Mt. Airy. We did a high velocity system with a wifi thermostat and a heat pump option. They worked with our particular needs and tastes to get to just the right solution. Bob and team showed up every day on time, cleaned up meticulously and finished the job ahead of schedule."
Home Services,2.5,OR,I am very happy with this system!! The prices are great and they are a local company. I love being able to use everything on my smartphone. I have had no problems with this unit and their prices beat every other security system out there.  I LOVE the Skybell doorbell motion sensor and camera. You can answer your door anywhere in the world without having to open the door. I highly recommend this company and their product!
Home Services,1.5,OR,Save yourself a lot of hassle. The worst service. Takes 20-30 mins average on phone calls. If you put your card on auto pay and leave it and you service a van to come to your house and they show or don't show up they sometimes charge $50 onto that card stating it's part of your monthly bill being it was added.. they are a failing company. My 30mbs was only 15 average. Don't fall for their gimmicks.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"We searched for moving companies in st louis and found Cord Moving to move our office. We had a simple move and they were flawless. Cord Moving company helped us move in a very short time. They were efficient and highly organized, everything was handled with kid gloves. I would really recommend if you are looking for a moving company or searching out moving companies to look at Cord Moving first as they are awesome to deal with."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I am a first time renter and was nervous about the prospect of not having control of my home.  Wolf and Associates were helpful, friendly and attentive to my needs from my first response to their ad.  Three months into the renting of my cottage they have surpassed my expectations by responding to the three issues I have presented.  They send efficient and friendly people to address the issues presented.  I am indeed grateful"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Spectrum/Charter promised a credit/rebate for some unusual personal circumstances. When I followed up 1 1/2 weeks later, they told me there was no record of the credit/rebate, they don't offer credits, they won't offer credits, and I owe them money. I went over the same circumstances that resulted in the credit with two other people, and they wouldn't agree to issue the previously agreed upon credit. If you have a choice, avoid Spectrum/Charter. The customer service is deplorable."
Home Services,1.5,OR,We moved in June 2021 and so far I'm happy with this apartment complex. I did have an issue with the parking arrangement however that seems to be getting better. Everyone that I have come in contact with has been very helpful and nice including my neighbors. I love the location of the apartments and the only reason I gave them a four star is the pricing of the apartments but that seems to be everywhere around here.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Our movers, Justin and Dennis, we're professional, courteous, and efficient during our office move. They carefully wrapped the furniture and other pieces. When we realized a large executive desk wouldn't fit the way we planned in the new office, they helped us move it again to a better place without any complaints. We also had to make a second stop at our storage unit which they did without a problem. Wonderful customer service! We highly recommend this team!"
Home Services,3.0,CG,"Stay away, period. Stay at this place and let the folks at NOLA County fix this horrible place. If you want to get your money's worth, you're going to have to pay it.

Home Services,5.0,CG,"Have used this company 2 times. The first time they did a nice job, the second time they did a horrible job. I am not saying they are bad, but it is not worth it.

Home Services,4.5,CG,"Today my office used College Green to clean the upstairs bathroom. The upstairs bathroom was a mess. The bed, table and chairs were not clean. The bathroom was dirty and in need of a cleaning. I called to see if they would be able to come out to look at it. They did not come out."
Home Services,4.0,CG,"Been using them for years. We have had the best experience with them. Thank you!Very disappointed. We had an old dishwasher run out and they had to come out to fix it. After a week of waiting, they said they would be here within a week. They had no idea what was going on with the dishwasher and they had to call me back to come out."
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Adam and his team are amazing. The guys were very professional and polite, and the work was done in a timely manner.

I called several times to report a problem with the heater."
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Operator said there was a problem with the system and they would fix it within a couple of days.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Asked company to call me to schedule an appointment.  After 5 hours, got a response saying ""sorry I was unable to get to my phone today"".  They also asked if they could call me the following day.  I said sure.  After waiting till 11am and sending them a couple of requests, I decided 24 hours was enough time for them to reach out to me if they wanted my business.  They never called me."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Tony and Edison are beyond professionals! They came and installed a chandelier in our dining room. Super quick to respond, on budget, and flawless installation. They even where kind enough to haul off the large box the chandelier came in and install a temporary dimmer switch for that extra ambience. Will use them for our Lutron lighting install and any and all other electrical needs we have. 

I highly recommend you give them a chance for your electrical needs."
Home Services,4.0,OR,I had a terrible experience working with this company. I was trying to load images for days to the specific size that they specified and when I ask for help they just blew me off. The system asked for images that are less than 2 MB and all of my images are less than two but when I ask for them to help me they just reassigned me to another MLS agent. Don't waste your time with these guys.
Home Services,3.0,OR,I had my furnace tune up done and the motor needed a capacitor.  TML charged me $112 for the capacitor which if you were to purchase from Amazon is less than 8$ including shipping.  There are other places like McCombs where you can get for less than 6$ including shipping.   I dont mind paying more but 14X higher sounds like a big rip off.  Too naive to have thought such a thing can happen.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I was frantically looking for last minute cleaning online and found iMaid. I booked online (amazing) and then when I saw the price, I definitely thought it was too good to be true. When I got home later that day. my house was absolutely perfect. Everything looked great and the pricing is so good I almost don't want to share the secret with anyone else!

Thank you so much for leaving my house spotless, looking forward to another cleaning service."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Outstanding.  They pruned our oaks and 2 of our neighbors oaks. Price was very reasonable.   Did a great job and cleaned up spotless.  They are very knowledgeable about trees and Kevin's son, Dale, took some time to explain things about the way trees grow that I didn't know.  He really knows the science of trees.   I definitely recommend them and will be calling them the next time I need my oaks pruned."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"These guys rock. I had a spot window between 8 - 10 am. They showed up at 8:30 and went straight to work.
I won a garage door inspection at a yelp event I attended, and it included a 40 point inspection on both doors.
They repaired one of the sensors, programmed a remote for me, lubed all the wheels, made sure the hinge bolts were tight, and adjusted the tension on the chain.
Great service, definitely will be using them again."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We've only been in our home a few years and our carpets are clean, however we wanted to take a proactive approach to ensure they stay that way - and also so we won't have to replace them anytime soon, especially with kids. Due to Leo's high reviews and fair pricing, we got our carpets proactively cleaned and I'm so glad we did - they look brand new again. Leo and his team were on time, responsive, and professional."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I chose to use Old City Movers based on their great reviews and fair prices, and their service did not disappoint! They arrived on time and moved me across the bridge from Camden to Philly in just three hours, which was less than the original estimate. The crew was friendly and polite and were easy to communicate with throughout the process. I would highly recommend their services to friends and family in the future. It was worth every penny!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"EVERY company does the same thing. They hope you do not look at your bill when your contract is up and they hope you ignore the letter they send you (assuming you have a contract of six months or more) and then the variable rates go up to double what you would be paying otherwise. It is a bit slimy, yes indeed. Did I get caught, yup! Then I made sure every renewal was on my calendar. Problem solved."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Dan was great to work with - he is knowledgeable and had great practical solutions. Contracts were explicit and he and his crew were here exactly when he said they would be. (This is rare in my experience lately.) The crew, lead by Mike, were great as well. Super friendly and respectful of the property. Mike checked regularly to make sure we were happy with the progress. I will definitely use them again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them!"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"My experience with T and H Realty has been stellar.  The best property management team/landlords I have had the pleasure to work with.

If I return to Indianapolis to reside, T and H would be the first phone call I make to secure my housing...thank you for your outstanding service!!"
Home Services,5.0,CG,Dave responded to a request for an estimate. We had a lot of work to do and we had a lot of questions. We took the time to talk to a lot of people and we had no issues.

Home Services,1.5,CG,"Pitiful! DO NOT USE THEM!!! They will NOT let you in!!!

If you have been following the other reviews, I would say, ""well, if you're a great customer, that's fine. Just be aware of your own experience. If you're an excellent customer, that's fine too. And if you're not, then don't bother with them at all."
Home Services,5.0,CG,"We inherited a VERY overgrown tree. The tree was in a very bad shape, the leaves were broken and the tree had a lot of branches and branches that were not growing. I called the company and was told the branch cut in the wrong direction. This was true for two trees. I had a 2 yard line to the tree and the branch cut right on to the tree."
Home Services,3.5,CG,"This company has far exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend them. Thanks!

5 stars for a solid and efficient work ethic, and great customer service. The customer service person at the office is horrible. He told me I had to call him back and he would be out at 8:30am. I called back at 8:45am."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I know everyone shares the headache of moving, and no one ever looks forward to it.  However, Bernard Movers coordinated the perfect move!

Home Services,4.0,OR,"Cindy took our call yesterday when our house went down to 16 degrees and we could not figure out why we weren't getting heat.

They came to my house and cleaned 3 rooms. My technician, Andrew, was very prompt and very friendly. He arrived early and finished quickly. 

Great customer service is the cornerstone of any good business, and these guys certainly provided great customer service to me. I also like the fact these guys are local."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Marco and Oscar, from BACK2Green Landscaping, did an excellent job for me recently. They kept Me informed as to when they would arrive, and immediately went to work on the tree planting.  They finished the work in a timely manner, and quickly gave me a bid for some additional work that had been planned. They are professional, and do good work, at a reasonable price. They are my choice for any landscaping I will be doing in the future."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"This company was my go to when I had to get a job done with our rental in Tucson. I would make a request, either to clean the house, do yard work, haul an item away, etc. George was always great about making arrangements with whatever request I had and would get the job done. He would provide me with pictures because I lived in another town. They were very easy to work with. Thank you Arizona Elite Home Services."
Home Services,5.0,OR,Ruth Ann Bowe is the best. She helped me locate the perfect home and made the purchase of my first home a great experience. She is very knowledgeable and was extremely patient with my endless questions and concerns. I purchased during a very busy time in my life and she handled everything for me. I will always use Ruth Ann as my Realtor and recommend her to all my friends and clients.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"We moved into this apartment complex in May of 2020 and it was the best choice we could have made. The apartment complex is above reproach. It is well-maintained at all times, the leasing staff is always ready and willing to help with a pleasant smile, maintenance is extraordinary. Maintenance requests are handled promptly, courteously and effectively. I definitely give them a five-star rating. We came from one of their sister properties in Lake Mary and there's just no comparison."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"These guys were terrific! They moved a baby grand piano for me this past November. They were easy to work with, professional, very careful and were in and out quickly. Kevin and his team were great to work with. Very personable and shared a bunch of information about how to care for my piano and where to go to get it tuned. The tuning people are the same high quality professionals as Duffy's. Great experience, I would highly recommend them."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"All points bulletin issued in Medley at Southshore Bay for Lennar employee Lori Campagna. We have been looking for her since December 2019. She was the person who authorized a company to install a fence on my property without my knowledge or permission. She is avoiding me because her error in judgement has caused an issue she is incapable of fixing. 
If considering moving to Medley at Southshore Bay by Lennar,
Be careful, be very careful.
You might be her next victim."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Masons is a very professional, family owned business and they know their stuff. I chose them for their great customer ratings and every word I read was accurate. From the 1st call to schedule an appointment, the experience was pleasant,professional, courteous and informational. They were extremely careful and clean and did alot of work in a short period of time. The price was fair and worth every penny. I would highly recommend Masons to anyone and intend to do so."
Home Services,1.0,OR,I wish there were negative stars!  They billed my credit card over $1600 and won't return phone calls (over 15 messages left over the course of 2 weeks).  The technician that did come out performed the wrong service and told us that the service that we supposedly contracted for isn't even available through TruGreen.  Now I have to go to the trouble of hiring a lawyer to get my money back.  DO NOT USE TRU GREEN!!!!
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Offered a $49.00 discounted service call for my HVAC. Did not do anything they described in the call. This was just an excuse to get in my house and try to up sell everything I did not need. Best of all was that they said because I was an essential worker that I would get all this free service totaling over $800 bucks provided I bought their new air cleaner system at the time of $1700.
Stay away from these shisters."

When I asked then to send an itemized bill to my new address, they CLAIMED it was returned. I asked Greg to resend and the next thing I got in the mail was a letter telling me I was being sued for the amount due. All I wanted was an itemized bill before I shelled out 4k!!! Wow!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"I paid the deposit in May for windows and doors. The windows got installed in July, 2 months after, the doors haven't been installed, it's the end of AUG. They said the door hasn't arrived. I have waited for almost 4 months for installation. I don't want to wait for it anymore and would like to cancel it but they say I can't cancel it.  Bad service, I have to keep follow up with them for windows and doors installation."

Home Services,2.0,OR,"I was a little nervous to have movers, as it was my first time, but the guys were very quick, efficient, and did not waste any time! Not to mention they were very polite and ended up rearranging my furniture multiple times as I was indecisive about how I wanted my new layout to look! This company is super affordable with no hidden fees just as they said when I called to inquire! Thanks for making my moving process a breeze!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"They put in a tankless water heater for me. And after accessing my plumbing needs they actually recommended one that was less expensive than the one I had originally wanted. It's awesome. A never ending supply of hot water..that gets to the faucets lickity split!
They also installed some modern looking fixtures that I bought and was going to install myself. I'm glad we let them do it. My wife (and I) have peace of mind now.
I would definitely use them again."
Home Services,4.0,OR,We did a remodel in our home a chose to have a licensed plumber instal the faucets.   There was a slow leak after the instal (not before) and the company said they would not warranty the work because we purchased the NEW faucets.   This was not disclosed at the time of the instal.  Mike was very rude and told me if I did not pay immediately for the leak repair they would remove the supply lines.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I called Samson and sons to fix my mother's air conditioner. I live in Las Vegas, NV and didn't really know who to call, so I looked on yelp and  liked the reviews so I called them. They were out quickly and fixed the problem.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I guess this partly goes to the location in Boston since that's where we started from, but all in all our truck-rental-experience with Penske was pretty good. They were cheaper than UHaul (and had better customer reviews by far), it was super easy picking up and dropping off, the truck was clean and ran well; it was relatively painless, which is all one can ask when needing to rent a truck to move one's life 300+ miles in one day =P"
Home Services,4.5,OR,Sam came out to fix my garage door. He was on time and professional. He gave na a fair price and fixed the door on site. He did let me know that my unit was a good one but not the best. He let me know that he carries the best. He wasn't trying to sell me a new one just thought he would mention it. I would definitely call Sam back if I happen to crash into the door again.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Adam and Yuri were phenomenal! Everything was wrapped and handled with care. All of my furniture was resembled perfectly with no damages. Not to mention, they maneuvered my couch into my new apartment in an incredible tight stairwell- again no damages! They were professional and even had a positive spirit despite the countless stairs.

Home Services,4.0,OR,Wow! What great service. The technician fixed a pipe right at the floor that I have hit while installing a door. He fixed my bad fast and at a great price. He was on time and very professional. I was so supposed that he was able to work with the 1965 copper pipe that was out of shape and modify it to work. I was quoted $1500 by another company. They did it for $230. Thanks again! I am so impressed.
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I called Always Plumbing at 9:30 in the evening as my floor drain backed up. Landon was at my house by 10:30. I appreciated the text updates that he was on the way and even the short bio on him.

But now renting from a nice company for an H.O.A home community . I feel I'm finally broke into the Arizona ways.  Rent and shut up.  If you don't like it fix it yourselves or move.  Rental companies here are what I'd call slumlords anywhere else that I have lived.  Sad world."

I hired them to replace my 3 bedroom home with a new home.
Home Services,1.5,CG,"What a horrific cable TV/internet provider. The only reason I've ever used them is because I'm a self-employed woman and I don't want to have to deal with a company that's just as bad as Comcast. I'm extremely pleased with the service provided by the Comcast team. They're great at what they do, but they don't seem to care about you."

Home Services,4.0,OR,"I contacted Apple Roof Cleaning and they couldn't have been friendlier. They showed up on time and cleaned my roof for a damn fair price. Now I just go outside and gaze at my roof sometimes for hours. What can I say, I have a clean roof and I'm proud of it. Don't hesitate to contact this company today for roof cleaning. You guys know I'm stingy with my 5-star reviews, but this one is well-deserved! I give this company five Yee-Haws!"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"The best! I started as a young bachelor in Philadelphia and I found myself using literally every moving company in the city. I felt that most over charged, weren't efficient, or damaged my stuff. Moving U was fabulous, the team they sent me got the damn thing done. They showed up on time and moved me from the city to the burbs by mid noon. I highly recommend using them over the likes of mambo, Olde city, and any other moving company."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Can't say enough positive things about this company. I needed an estimate with recommendations on a specific tree. They came out immediately and were extremely professional. Despite their busy schedule, they were able to squeeze us in before the recent storms. Their team came out and carefully took great care in my lanai, where the tree was positioned over, and removed it without any damage or disturbance to the vegetation surrounding the trunk. Certainly would use this company again without any reservation!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"This company is wonderful to work with.  They quoted the job, we set up a time and then they did the work (installed two ceiling fans and two other fixtures) two weeks later. This was a big job because they had to run wires where no fixtures existed before.  Corey and Steve were great.  Friendly, put plastic over everything and cleaned  up everything.  I will use them again if I have any more electrical work to do."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"For a second time my payment was late because their drafting system failed, even though I had the money for the payment in the bank.  I am expecting another late claim on my credit.  They charged me a ridiculous fee along with late fees to fix it over the phone.  If a lawyer is reading this, you need to sue these bums.  There is definelty some shady practices going on that should pay out in a legal claim."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Steve came out and discussed a new system with me.  No pressure, no hype, quoted a reasonable price and set up an appointment for a few days later.  Two guys came and removed my old system, put in the new one and were done very quickly.  I could tell they knew what they were doing!  They took time to review everything with me and made sure I understood how the system worked.  High praise for this company!"

Same house, same location, same requirements, same every other week request, two different prices. 

I do not trust this company and will not be moving forward. Pricing a bid should be done according to calculated factors according to the house, not made up like it was in this case. 

Untrustworthy due to inconsistent biding."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT EVER. Staying at one of their properties over Christmas. We talked to them for 2 days upon our arrival about simple maintenance issues and they never sent anyone to fix them. Now it's Christmas Day, we have family over and the toilet stopped working.

Home Services,3.5,OR,Someone parked in my parking spot at my apartment an I was told to call this security company and have that car booted. When I called the operator was rude and sounded like he hated his job and told me he would dispatch someone. 5 HOURS LATER they still had not sent anyone. I am VERY unhappy with their services. Mostly the person who was in charge of dispatching someone. Whoever that was working on 9/10/2018 at 3:40pm needs a new job.

He cleaned up the space when the work was done. He didn't mind going to Home Depot when he found out the cord was missing (I didn't know that I had to buy the cord as well. ). Very reasonable price and such a hard worker. I'll call him for all my plumbing needs.
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Moved in about a month ago and I like the place. Awesome CBD location, very clean common areas, and the building has been very quiet. BEST OF ALL they will do a 3 or 6 month lease, this works out great if you are just moving to the city and don't know for sure where you want to be. The rooftop pool is not open yet but it looks great. I had a couple of move in maintenance issues and they responded quickly."

They spend time safely wrapping every piece of furniture. We never had that before. They were efficient and thorough, and it was incredibly affordable. We will use them for any future move; can't recommend them highly enough."
Home Services,4.0,OR,We recently hired Absolutely Faux to texture and paint stone columns and fireplaces in our home. They were prompt in following up with us and very communicative and detailed in creating samples for us and gave us a bid for their services quickly.  Their painting on our stone fireplace was excellent and they worked with us to phase their workdays so they would fit into a larger renovation project schedule. We will absolutely work with this company again and highly recommend them.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Meh- hit or miss.  We seem to need them to follow up on issues at a rental more often than I would expect, but their servicemen are pleasant.  
What particularly outrages me, however, is a serviceman recently was in quarantine for Covid and because he was unvaxxed at the time, he was placed on unpaid leave and disallowed his accrued sick time.  Unconscionable!  This sort of discrimination and malicious penalization speaks to a really twisted mentality in their management."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"BEWARE This is a moving scam. The way it works is they will give you a very low price quote and ask for a deposit. They are able to give you a low deposit by intentionally misquoting the amount of money for the move. The next step is to hit you for $400 fee for a shuttle. If you are a small move they will probably not even show up. If you've given them money good luck, you'll probably never see it again."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I've had many cars detailed many times over the years with them. Always top notch service. They definitely go above and beyond when it comes to taking care of cars and customers. Most recently I got the windows tinted on my new Acura there and it came out great. Originally I was going to go darker, but the owner Ryan helped me select a slightly lighter shade that ended up being precisely what I was looking for. Wouldn't take my cars anywhere else."
Home Services,4.0,CG,"Called for AC check since it was the last time they checked it. When I got home, they said that they had a technician, but since they have a customer service specialist, it was impossible to get in touch with him. 

I called and spoke to the manager, who said that they could have another technician come out within 24 hours and then I would have to call the customer service department. "
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Looking for a reliable, professional, and professional company to help you in your bid for a home!Great job! Great crew! I am so glad I chose them.

They made it very easy and quick"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL.  The only reason I called them was because they didn't want to do anything about the phone calls, which they then provided to me.  I was told by the company that the problem would be fixed by one of the technicians who came out and repaired the problem.  I was also told that they would not be able to come out to fix the problem because the phone"
Home Services,4.0,CG,"11/15/18 follow up:  Steve (owner) came out and explained all the information that I needed and we went through the process of making our move.

The first time we moved in, the sink was completely broken and we had to replace the sink every time. "

They have great customer service and great customer service.
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Just moved into a new house and I thought it would be a nice place to live. The owner, B. B. C. took pride in his customer service and his workmanship. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a quality apartment. The apartments are beautiful and a bit pricey compared to the surrounding apartments. However, they are a solid investment in your home."
Home Services,5.0,CG,"With the help of the owner, I was able to fix the issue for a reasonable price. The owner, B.B.C., took the time to explain the problem and provide a written report. 

He was thorough, courteous and professional. He also took the time to explain the issue to the customer, which was great.

I hired them to repair a water leak in the basement and they did a great job."
Home Services,4.0,CG,"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!  I got a call from the owner, which was a nice surprise, I was just blown away by the customer service.  He took the time to explain the situation and made sure it was well understood.  I'm a loyal customer and he made me feel very comfortable.  Highly recommend him and will definitely be using him in the future!I had a very bad experience with this"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"What a busy little business!
I had an appointment with them in the morning and they were there within the hour. They had a nice, clean and professional crew. I was very impressed with the customer service and the professionalism of the crew. I would definitely use them again in the future. I used them for a house cleaning and I had a lot of issues with the paint job."
Home Services,5.0,CG,We shopped around for a few companies and found the one I chose was the best. I'm very pleased with the quality of the work.  The work was done in a very clean and professional manner.  It was a very professional job.  I would highly recommend.Great service!  They sent out a technician to fix a problem and helped me with my garage door.  They did a great job!

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I strongly recommend CertaPro-Reno.  
These guys made my 28 year old house look brand new. There attention to detail when pressure washing, scraping, caulking, masking, paint spraying, back rolling the paint, final touch-up and cleaning my property when done was at a level all construction contractors should aspire to.  
Four to five workers at a time, took only two days to paint my two story, 2,220 sq.ft. home.  
Shout out to Cosme Ortega the Production Manager and his hard working crew."
Home Services,2.5,OR,Don't sign the free invoice. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!! There service is a joke. DO NOT EVEN BOTHER.  Also DO NOT ACCEPT THE INVOICE BY E-MAIL. It is a trap. You are not accepting an invoice you are accepting a 6 month contract for service. Be advised that the owner is rude and will not let you out of they contract if you mistakingly accept what you think is an invoice. Be warned.  Please choose another company for you lawn care needs.
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I'm not sure if they outsource their scheduling and phone calls, but goodness gracious do they ever make it difficult to schedule an appointment and or get a rough estimate. After about 5 or 6 back and forth calls trying to schedule something regarding putting in an egress window, I finally just gave up on this company figuring if they are this difficult to deal with before they have my money, image what their customer service will be like after sent in a check."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Horrible company! Save yourself the trouble and stay away from them. This is the absolute worst customer service I have ever received and the work is not great either. 
After not returning my calls for over a month about finishing the job they now harass me about payment when it still is not finished how they said it would be. 
They have lied to me repeatedly and are always rude on the phone I wouldn't do business with company again if you paid me!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,They replaced our roof in August and we had to have them come back several times for clean up and items they missed. We made our payment and they assured us they'd be back the next week to clean up the tar all over our siding of our home and they have not come back. I have repeatedly called and left messages to no avail. This has been so frustrating and a waste of my time trying to get them to do their job.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Have used them for new ac unit and plumbing at my home
 As previously reported others said upwards of 16k to repair gas leak and they did for 450!! Just sent to my mothers and fixed a clogged sink that has been worked on before for less and works better then day bought 
Other companies were ""friends"" who tried to lie and rip me off..these guys are more then fair and do good work. Sent tons of referrals to them and all thank me!!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I can't say enough great things about Pazeto maids. I needed a move out cleaning for a large house on VERY short notice, and Renata worked with me to find a time that worked in my schedule. The cleaner was at the house on time and made everything sparkling clean. I've never seen the oven or fridge look as clean as it is now. Every inch of the house was spotless. Thank you so much!! I'm definitely going to be using their services again!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I worked with Mr. Watkins on an 8 unit AUD project with 1,400 square foot commercial.    Mr. Watkins is fantastic.  I found him to be knowledgeable, hard working and fair.    The project he did for me was not an easy project.  When other architects told me my project was too ambitious (as it's a tight piece of property), Dave kept working the design until every square foot was accounted for.  I recommend him without hesitation."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I toured Vantage today and loved it! Shaun was a great help to not only explain all the the amenities, but also provide insight into St. Petersburg! The apartments are in a great location; close enough to walk everywhere, but far enough away from the crowds. The building is clean and made of concrete and steel--perfect for living in peace and quiet. The views are also spectacular! I will be checking for availability on the daily in hopes to make Vantage my new home!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Do NOT use this company. Stay far away!!! While we were approved for a mortgage three months prior to settlement, and the approval was almost immediate, the day before settlement, they requested additional items that we could not get within the time frame. They had three months to investigate and did NOT. TR Johns, in particular, was NOT nice! The experience was horrific  In addition, their title company allowed our sale to go through,  though there was a lien on the property."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Thank you Mike for a job well done! So nice to have the front porch light working again, and I appreciate that you looked at the whole system to determine the problem. (I've had another licensed electrician ""fix"" it but it stopped working shortly afterwards.) It's nice to have a professional you can trust to fix the problem. I have an old house (1952) that needs a lot of work and I'll be reaching out to All About Electric Service to get that done."
Home Services,5.0,CG,"My sliding glass door was locked. The only way to fix it was to have the person who came out and checked the lock say, ""I don't know, maybe it's not that big of a deal. "" So I said, ""Well, if I don't fix it, I'll call someone else. "" I guess it's a sign of the office to not do things the way they say they will."
Home Services,5.0,CG,This a great service. I had an emergency emergency and they were able to come out within a couple hours.  I had a leak in my air conditioner and they fixed it in under an hour.

Home Services,1.0,CG,"Trying to get anything resolved, I called the office and was told they didn't have a supervisor. I called the company and they said they didn't have a supervisor. They were going to go through my credit card info and I would have to call the office to get it. I also had a 2 day waiting period to get it fixed. I called the office and was told they wouldn't do anything."
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Ben is Amazing! My mom and I had an appointment in two days. When we got home, we noticed that we had a leak in our air conditioner.

Home Services,4.0,CG,"Fantastic Service, friendly, knowledgeable people, and professional. We just had a horrible experience with the Clipper. We called them the next day, and they said the service was not working. We were told it was an electrical issue, which was obviously not the case. After some waiting around for the technicians to come out, I finally found them on the phone and they told us they had already been there."

Home Services,1.5,OR,I'd give Zero Stars if possible. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! It's a frat house. No one owns individual apartments. They lease them and AiRbnb them to tourists. The pool is crowded and loud all day and even into the late after hours with drunk people. You can hear doors in the hallway slam as well as people above you walking around with heavy feet. Never again. The only good thing is the location. But for $2000 a week it's a waste of money and time.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Best quote after calling over 15 places! No clueless dispatcher & their trip fee tricks. Spoke directly to Santiago who was Professional, knowledgable sent his partner Romero out to me replace the keyphob for my 2015 Nissan Altima (push start ignition button) that I lost while moving. He's based in Ft. Bend county but I scheduled an appointment for him to come to me in Upper Kirby/River Oaks area. Highly recommended and I'm defiantly keeping his contact info! Thanks Low Price Keys (Santiago and Romero)!!!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Tuan came out to fix an exterior storm water drain and while he was here he offered to install my new reverse osmosis water filtration system for half of what other plumbers were charging. There were unavoidable  surprises with both jobs and Tuan was able to figure out solutions quickly for the water filter install and work with me to figure out options for the outside drain. He is knowledgeable, easy to work with, reasonably priced, efficient and neat. Great plumber and honest too!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Brian just finished a job for me and I had to go on Yelp to state what a great guy he is, as well as a neat and efficient worker. I believe he could repair just about anything. We traded stories about repairs that we had done individually and I am confident enough in his abilities to keep him in my phone as someone I will use time and time again. He is a find and definitely a keeper for large and small home repairs."
Home Services,1.5,OR,Unbelievable.  Worst customer service ever.  Charge me 118.00 late fee for assessed charges they did not make me aware of thus resulting in 39.00 of underpayment (after paying the exact same mortgage for YEARS!)  The best they could do was cut the late fee in half (by the way because I check my account often it was 2 days past due) thus resulting in a late fee almost double the actual charge.  These people are terrible terrible terrible with customer service.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Great service, experienced and diligent!!  Experienced packers from this company came in and provided great service and moving advice.  I wish they offered out of state moving services; the company I used was TERRIBLE with a triple capital T.  I am sure that my move would have gone much better if Davis Moving offered out of state moving services.  I highly recommend them for any packing services or moves.......take it from someone who has had the experience of terrible moving services....."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Unfortunately, I can't give them no stars so 1 will have to suffice. Consistently the most unavailable, unreachable, unhelpful, and rude customer service I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. I'm less than halfway through my year long lease and I can't wait to get out of it in order to avoid dealing with Sandpiper ever again. I would recommend avoiding doing business with them at all costs because a relationship with them will ultimately be more costly to you in the long run."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Just moved in and already CANT WAIT TO MOVE OUT!! Upon moving both the fridge and the stove don't work. We supposedly moved into a remodeled unit but everything seems poorly remodeled. The counters are literally painted over. When simply cleaning them the paint comes off. They seriously should take down their sign saying ""Luxury Apartments"" cause there's nothing luxury about this place at all! Also don't be fooled by their ""model"" of the apartments. I give the one star just for the nice location"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Thank you! Metro Chem Dry did an outstanding job! They were on time, friendly and efficient. 

I am in condo with no access for the cleaning hoses. Instead of saying ""no"" like the 5 other companies, they said ""no problem"". 

My carpets look amazing. I did not realize how badly they needed a good cleaning. My carpet was not drenched as with other companies. They used all green products and they are safe for my dog. 

Do yourself a favor and call Metro Chem Dry!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,The follow through and initial talks were very informative to help us feel confident in our solar panel type and size choice. Marilyn always made it a point to follow up on all the questions I had and the installation was on time and quickly done! We had so many solar sales folks in and out of our house telling me this and that but Marilyn was very honest and straightforward. Would do it all over again with Plant Solar if I had a choice!

I was very please with them as they showed up promptly with little notice and knew how to fix plumbing from 1924!!!

And even with welding and needing to get special parts the price was surprisingly reasonable. ( Special parts and plumbing are very scary terms to me financially!)

Highly recommend and they could have easily gone a much more expensive route but did not

They had many recommendations on my neighborhood boards too

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Sierra Nevada Properties, Specifically Oscar Canonigo, are an immeasurable asset when looking to purchase a new home. Oscar took the time to explain the process and even when a situation didn't directly involve his part of the process, he was still committed to giving us an accurate answer. 

The home buying process can be stressful and emotional, but with Oscar as our Realtor we felt completely at ease and assured that we were getting the best service in the industry.

Thank you Oscar! You are the MAN!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"5 STAR COMPANY. They are an AMAZING company. I am so grateful to have DAWN BAGBY as my property manager. A FIVE STAR MANAGER. I do not live in TN and traveling is very difficult for me (back issues) so I needed someone reliable, personable and trustworthy. DAWN BAGBY went that 'extra mile' to get my apt 'renter ready' and find a great tenant for me -- AND QUICKLY. She has been my guardian angel. I am so lucky that I found Synergy Real Estate Group."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Kudos to Tony Monaghan and the Irish Construction crew!  Tony came to my place on Friday to give me an estimate.  I explained my other estimates and we negotiated an agreeable deal. To make things even better he was able to get the job done the next day which I really was not expecting.  Kevin and Joe were very friendly and conscientious, and did a great job tuck pointing and repairing my chimney and cap, and some other spots around my brick house."
Home Services,4.5,OR,My pool was green and I called Larry for some help. He responded quickly and took care of the problem. He is very reliable and trustworthy. He educated me on how to take care of the pool and what we need to do to avoid algae build up. He also educated us on the normal maintenance. He inspected all our equipment and replaced parts as needed. He didn't nickel and dime us. He is very reasonable and we will gladly use him again in the future
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Me and my wife lived in rented apartments across several states since 2011, but we've never been happier anywhere else. 

The location is perfect. Your hidden from the major roads and there are no other traffic except the local complex one. You are close to the mall and all the major groceries stores.

The value for dollar is just what really makes this place stand out. These beautiful apartments are worth every penny.

To be honest this was the only place I actually went and renewed my lease."
Home Services,4.5,OR,This company gets it! We had 4 company vehicles in rough shape. We went in and from the very beginning they went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met. After the first van was done we wanted a few things touched up and they did so right away. Not only did they touch it up for free they made sure that for the following vehicles the same work would be done. We will be being every vehicle here in the future!!! Highly recommend!!!
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Total joke. The ONLY way this sad company stays in business is because they contract with American Home Warranty, which is also a joke. They came to fix a couple serious plumbing and ac issues and actually made the issues worse. They left a mess and damaged my house. When I called them to complain the owner screamed at me calling me every name in the book and threatened me. Sylvia is the customer service rep. An absolute train wreck of a company. Shockingly bad service."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"My stay at the this Ritz was not an enjoyable experience, the staff was rude or at the very least not interested in servicing their customers, the room was not well kept, the mini bar had half open bottles of water, and when I mentioned about the lack of service to one of the room service members I got a short answer and she hang up the phone on me. Would not recommend this hotel. I have staid at other Ritz and never had this experience."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Worst service ever, hope I had gone with a better internet service provider, it took me a total of 8 hours of calling and following up to know that I will not get my connection on the said date. You guys don't even know if your technicians are working or not because my order was assigned to a technician who was on leave. Good luck with your order assignment software. Hopefully I would not have to spend another 8 hours to have my internet service started."
Home Services,3.0,CG,This company has screwed with us. The only reason they are still around is because the person who came to check on the phone said he could not get the job done. They were late and we were told they would be at work around 8:30. This is a joke. The first time we called they said they would be at work around 10:30. So they said they could not do the job until they got there.
Home Services,5.0,CG,This guy know's what he's doing. The only reason I don't recommend this company is because he doesn't know how to do the job. He is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I have been in business for over 20 years. This company is a joke. You would think a woman could have a fair and professional experience. I have had several companies come out and take care of my problem with them.

Home Services,4.5,CG,When I called I was told they couldn't even come out because they didn't have a full time job so I had to get a call back and the manager told me it was fine.  They had no idea what to do with me.  I called to ask if they would be able to come out because I was staying in a hotel.  They said no they had already been there.  I called and they were there
Home Services,4.0,OR,changing my review they packed our pods in june they didn't use blankets I provide or plastic wrap. my furniture its scratched or chipped and stained.

The owner, Andrew, is a wonderful person and works with you and the pricing was fabulous.

My friends will be using them shortly and I am sure they will recommend their friends to use redwood tree service as well."
Home Services,4.0,OR,I was very impressed at the speed Sublime Electric was able to send me a bid.  I am out of state and looking to purchase a property.  Sublime Electric made a point of going to the property to check out my electric issues in all units at a last minute notice (when 5 other companies declined) and sent out a written bid for the work that very day.  I will not hesitate to use Sublime Electric in the future with that great Customer Support.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Great, honest business from start to finish. I initially came in, explained what I wanted, and they gave me a price. I received $100 off since I had my windows tinted and the Clear bra installed. My car was completed exactly when they said it would be and the work  was excellent!  Everything came with a warranty and after talking with the owner/ installer Bob, he assured me if I have any problems he will correct them. Awesome job, my car looks great! Thank you"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Where do I start....... Usually in this business you expect the company/person to answer the phone or call back within a reasonable time BUT not with this company. Horrible service and when we finally got a call back today we felt rushed to hang up the phone he didn't offer any other properties for us to look at just total trash act class, and trash act company. Y'all need to fix yourself of get out of the business HORRIBLE. If I could give zero starts I would!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Marshall has been excellent in terms of service.  Their office staff are always friendly and helpful. The technicians we've met have all been great, hard-working guys.  When we have an emergency they are always quick to respond. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is their pricing for both oil & systems, which are higher than others in the market.  But you get what you pay for, and I will stick with Marshall because I know they will take good care of me."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Very nasty people
After waiting 4 month to have them fix coping, excuses after excuses, they started the job. And it's taking longer then I was told. They keep telling me one thing and doing another. No one is on the same page. Zero  customer service. I am at the breaking point with them. I spent $7000 for a less than average job. Half the pavers had to be redone, then the coping started cracking and each time it takes months. Save your money, hire someone else."

My son-in-law tried a few different attempts to put up nets.  I finally called David and he responded promptly.  He told me he could do it.  It took a few attempts and the pigeons are gone.  David did his job and was wonderful.   He was very professional and no harm to pigeons.
Home Services,3.0,OR,"My wife and I moved here in December of 2014 and moved out in August of 2015.  Our experience was great all the way around.  The staff members in the office were always accommodating and helpful.  When we moved out there was garage work going on but they worked with the movers to make sure they had access where necessary.  They even helped with pet sitting when we were out of town.  

Great location and great staff - not one negative experience."

Home Services,5.0,CG,"After being treated rather poorly, I was told that they would need to make a new invoice and we would be billed the same.

The manager also said that if we tried to file a claim, the bill would be waived and that we would have to file a claim with the office."

It's really everything I was hoping for and more."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Customer service rep was very rude in the first 15 seconds of the conversation. I asked about internet services and his response was condescending. I would NOT recommend this company if that is how they treat POTENTIAL customers. At least hold the snarky til I'm paying you. My inquiry was about their advertised internet services, and was not a ridiculous question. Even if it had been, I would hope for some appreciation that I am even contacting your company offering my potential business (considering it was customer service)."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I needed to install a Tesla Wall Charger inside my garage and called a few Tesla certified electricians around the Wayne PA area. Bill had one of the several competitive quotes, but what I liked most was his responsiveness. The simple act of following up quickly on quotes and questions during a busy thanksgiving / Christmas period made him a standout. The work itself was well done, 100amp circuit to future proof the installation only cost a marginal additional fee for the copper wires. Overall a great experience."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Almost another month of calls have gone unanswered. Amy's response to direct message my contact information has proven useless because I can't seem to figure out how to direct message a business. I called yet again this morning and actually got a human to pick up the phone - only because I selected the prompt to order a new service. The agent promptly said ""let me connect you to our service department"". Guess what? Back in the infinite on-hold loop! My next call is to cancel the service."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I had a wonderful experience from a top notch tech named Bob Blanchette. He had a lot of work to do on my garage door which was explained before work was done. His work was top notch and professionalism was off the chart. Any future work that I need done, I will be requesting Bob to do the work. More companies should have employees like Bob to work for them. Bob is an exceptional Tech. I highly recommend his service and company. Thank-you again for your quality work."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"This company 
a) Does not do through background checks of tenants, despite claiming to
b) Does not make tenants comply with the company's own rules (rule about unlicensed vehicles on property)
c) Is difficult to communicate with. There is no phone number for letting them know about bad tenants or a problem with their property (trying to help them!)
d) Slow to act when finding a problem with their property that affects neighbors

All in all, a terrible company that could be so easily improved if they just did what they advertised."

If they had more units available with washer & dryer , I would have resigned my lease. 

I reccomend  this community"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"We recently had to put everything in storage as our home sold before we found a place.  Joe was very professional when delivering the pod, then yesterday he delivered it back to us at our new location.  He did a very good job of placing the pod exactly how we needed it.  My complaint is not with him but the office. You wait on line a long time to speak to anyone.   The people were very helpful once I was able to talk to them."
Home Services,2.5,OR,I ordered this in October 2013 and received my equipment quickly.  Within 30 days of setting everything up (install was no problem) I received the Kindle Fire and just this week received my Amazon gift card.  I had another company prior to this but cancelled becuase the equipment was hundreds of dollars and monitoring was a rip off.  Customer service with this company has been great.  I needed an extra key fob and they sent it out to me no charge.  I'd recommend them again.
Home Services,4.5,OR,We used Dave Maudlin as our inspector on a home we are in the process of purchasing. He was there early which was impressive. He was extremely professional and thorough. He answered all of our questions and was very friendly. He seemed very knowledgeable but if he didn't know an answer to a question he recommended the proper person to get specific details (consult a roofing expert for example). He was timely with his report and respectful of the sellers house. I highly recommend Indy pro inspection and Dave maudlin.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Our realtor asked them to bid on a few possible repairs prior to selling our home.  The technician called me directly to schedule (when realtor should have been contacted).  He wouldn't leave until he got a call back from the office, even after reminding he we only wanted a quote that could be emailed.  He had the nerve to bill me for a service call and proceeded to tell me ""it's not costing you 
anything ""!  Should have used IFS, the company we normally deal with."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"All I can say is I'm very impressed, Adam did a great job. We really enjoyed how professional and friendly his crews are. We have 2 new puppies that love to run around the back of the house everyday and it was very important that no nails would be lying around the garden as this could be very dangerous for our new puppies. Just as promised the guys would clean up after every day making sure no nails would pose a threat to our little pups. We highly recommend Adam."
Home Services,2.0,OR,No heat since Saturday night. They show up Monday for a service call. Don't open anything don't even try to get the heat back on. $9700 to replace the heater next day $12000 if you wait. You are crooks and should be shut down. Cost of new blower motor and capacitor from supply house $97 plus a couple hours labor and no markup for a friend. Now they have heat. Horizon told them they would die with no testing no diagnostic no combustion test. These people need to be shutdown.
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Don't rent Jerry Edward's properties. He is always traveling so it is hard to get in touch with him about any problems, like say, not getting your security deposit back. I think he has about 12 properties in Tucson, of duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes. They aren't in that good of shape and stuff doesn't get fixed in a timely manner, if at all. Just don't do it, the place you want to rent might be cheap and relatively cute, but you'll thank yourself later. Message me for more information."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"They installed an air conditioning unit. A brand new one.  It didn't work correctly even after 4 - 5 times servicing it.   I called another company.  Only to find out that the unit wasn't even set up correctly.  Humidity wasn't setup, yearly filter wasn't set up and the construction of the ducts actually inhibited proper air flow due to odd angles.  Shody work at best here.  Don't know about their plumbing side but stay away from the air conditioning part of RJ GUILTY."
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Absolutely THE WORST!!!! Commerce bank is an absolute scam!!!!  I will not recommend them to anyone!!!Great job by BEWARE. The office staff is the worst.

I called again and again to see if there was anything else"

The furnace was clean and was very reliable. We were extremely satisfied with the service and will use them again.We had a problem with our water heater.  We called the company and they said they would call me back within the hour.  I called them again and they said they would call me back within
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Santiago is an excellent locksmith. We have used him many times for our home inspection, and he has always been so professional.

Home Services,3.5,CG,Yeah it is a littlebilly. The guys at the front desk are always very nice and helpful.I had an issue with the fence.  The fence was not fixed.  The guy that came to fix it said it was a bit too high.  He said it would be $100 a piece.  I said it would be $300 and he said it was $110.  I said I would have to pay it to fix it
Home Services,3.5,CG,We hired Tor Chimney to replace a part that we had previously installed. They were very thorough and thorough.  They had a lot of information and they provided a great price.

I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new furnace.I will say I have had a very bad experience with the A/
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Jesse Bravo- Our realtor. With the help of Jesse I sold my mothers house that was in St. David, after she had moved out of state. He explained everything thoroughly which I explained to mom over the phone. He was always available to her by phone with her many many questions. The ease of signing the listing paperwork over the computer made the details a breeze. Jesse worked hard for his money, closed the deal and Mom adored him for it. I would definitely use him to buy or sell again."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We have used Luna Pool Service for four years.  Justin is a whiz at diagnosing problems, and we know that when we call him about an issue he will come to the house to take care of it in a very timely manner.  It is a pleasure working with Justin because he is extremely honest and tries hard to save us money.  The technicians who work for Luna Pool are very conscientious and hard working and well.  I would recommend this pool service without qualification to all."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Called this company to come out and check our drain. They did, then said they would write up a quote for a necessary repair. Three weeks later have never heard back. No we haven't been waiting, we moved on the someone else when we called the following week after the worker was here and found out he was on vacation and nothing could be done until the person's return. It's obvious they don't care about customers, since no follow up call was made to talk to us. Horrible company and service!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Date of visit: 7/29/21

I looked up reviews on other businesses and found some not so good. This place has nothing but good reviews and close to home. I was able to make an appointment and drop my car off. Daniel was very helpful with my choice of tints and great pricing on work that would be done. He had the windows done in less time than promised. No issues with bubbling at all. He did an excellent job!! I Would definitely take another vehicle there and I will recommend to others."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"This is the rudest, most disrespectful, unprofessional, dishonest, unresponsive plumber ever.  He started a job for me that should have been two days max.  He worked 2 hours and left.  1 month later he text asking what was going on with the job.  He finally returned to only work 3 hours and wanted full payment and the work isn't even 50% complete.  He thought I was being dramatic when I asked him to come back and finish.  I'm hiring someone else to finish his mess."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I have been using Rogers Cleaners for ten years or so. Their service has been outstanding! Recently I took a handmade item that I had very little hope for saving from an old spill. They took great care  with it and restored it to its original shape.  Another time I need to find a way to clean something that they were not able to take. They gave me a great suggestion on how to do it, and it worked perfectly.  I highly recommend their work and their service."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Awful. Not only do they do a piss poor job of cutting my grass, but they also leave a mess all over my neighbors property EVERY time they come. My lawn never looks freshly cut, it's always uneven with visible spots that are higher than others. The only thing these guys care about is getting the lawn cut as quickly as possible, they take no pride whatsoever in what they do. Their prices are fine, but they suck at what they do.  I'll be hiring another company for next year."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Just observed and worked with them moving my daughter from a 3 br house to a 2 br apartment, and managing to fit it all in.  Very well prepared and equipped with dollies, pads, huge rubber bands, mats to protect wood floors, etc.   They carefully wrapped all pieces, disassembling/reassembling as needed.  Got the job done in less than the 3 hour minimum time block including a 5 mile trek across South Tampa.  No problem with timing or damage, and all 3 workers were good-natured as well."
Home Services,4.5,OR,It's a shame this place hasn't updated their page to reflect the fact that they are NOT open on Saturdays. I sent my son down there because they appeared to be the only shop open on a Saturday and he sat there for 20 minutes this morning hoping that someone would show up. (I updated the stars on this because I don't want the fact that their hours are misstated to impact how people feel about them or their quality - something I unfortunately didn't have the chance to see myself.
Home Services,1.5,CG,What a joke!  Negative reviews on Yelp are very inaccurate. The person who came to my home had a bad attitude. The person who showed up was very rude and hung up. It was clear that he was trying to get me to sign a contract for the remainder of my stay. I did not want to be rude and I was so upset that I didn't sign the contract.
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Joe and his team were prompt, professional and very knowledgeable.  We had a very large tree we had removed and had to replace, which took some time and money.

Home Services,4.0,CG,"I honestly don't recommend this company. The only reason I did is because they didn't make the time to get the job done. The guys that did the job were so great and polite that it was obvious they were in good hands. If you are going to use this company, do yourself a favor and call them. I would recommend them to anyone looking to hire a home inspector.We had a great experience with our new home inspector and they did a"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"What a joke, where do I start?  

From the beginning, I was just a little nervous.  The office staff was very polite, and the first day I signed up, they had everything I needed.  They came out the following day to check on my house, and gave me a very quick and thorough inspection.  I felt like I was being treated fairly.  I went on to have a few items checked out, and"
Home Services,1.5,CG,Terrible plumbing company.  Do not use them.  Not worth it.Had a very bad experience with them. They had to replace a valve that was leaking out of the side of my shower. They had to call out the water heater on the side of the shower to fix it. I had a 2 year old shower and it had a leak in the side of the shower. They told me to call them back and they were there by the time

Home Services,5.0,CG,I came home from work and found the AC running. I called back and asked about the AC. He said it had to be replaced. He then said he would be back in a couple days.

I asked him if he would be back in a few days and he said no.

Home Services,3.0,CG,"I needed old floors removed and an AC system replaced. I chose G&G because of the high quality and affordable price. I am a firm believer that if you are a professional and truly want to get the job done, you will find a company that can do it. They were a pleasure to work with and I will be calling them again when I have the opportunity. We had a great experience with G&G from the beginning."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Possibly the worst experience I've ever had with dealing with a rental company. The management staff is very unprofessional and rude. Countless times would we come in to discuss and issue and the management staff *cough*cough Sophia would turn it into an argument and try to belittle us. They are also very dishonest claiming anything they can to get you to pay extra fees. It's very irritating, frustrating and disappointing. I've lived at many rental properties and apartments and this has by far been the worst experience thus far. Will NEVER recommend."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Walked in here last weekend and was introduced to the GM, Ethan. Told him what I wanted and he showed me some options. He then took me to the remnants section and my mother found the perfect piece of carpet for my daughters bedroom. Had them come and install that and new baseboards just 3 days later. 3 guys show up and installed it all beautifully as well as making sure they cleaned up entirely when done. We will be coming here for our next room remodel for sure! Thanks Carpet Store!!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"This is a brand new living community. Some of the amenities have been postponed, but as a resident I feel the communication from office employees has always been on top of it. With a brand new community opening, it's quite apparent that they would have a lot on their plates and with that being the case, our work orders and concerns have always seemed to be of the utmost importance to the staff. Happy to live in such a beautiful community where I as a resident feel valued. Also, we love Josh!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"My wife and I picked up a Groupon for an A/C tune-up and check. I'm glad that we did. The service was prompt and even though we had to reschedule a couple times, they were very accommodating, calling prior to arrival (extra important with a 5 month old at home). We were given a breakdown of our problems and a list of recommendations and quotes. The interactions were very professional and there was no pressure to buy anything extra. I would recommend them for others looking at evaluating their heating and/or cooling!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Quite a bit of money was spent for Michael Taylor to regrout our kitchen counters. He was here for 3-4 days, finished removing old grout, regrouping, sealing with the 'best', using his patented tool, several of them actually. He told me to only use vinegar and water to clean. This has not worked, not only is our white grout coffee brown in places, vinegar and water has not cleaned the grout. He was to come by Tuesday, and did not show, no call back. I would not recommend this company."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Do yourself a favor and read all these reviews before you sign up for a contract, I wish I had.  There is no way out of your contract even if you're moving and selling your home. You have to give them 30 days notice that you pay for that month and then you have to pay out the remainder of your contract. There's so many better options out there nowadays. You can get and install a Nest yourself and the cameras work great. If you're thinking of buying ADT services DON'T!"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Had Davis install a new heating and AC system in 2008. Of the companies we talked to , they were, by far, the most knowledgeable and professional. They also didn't play games (i.e. ""sign today and I can take $500 off the price"") with pricing, which I really appreciate. 

Just recently, the AC unit didn't work. I called there afterhours line. Their tech got back to me in 15 minutes! They were out at my house the next day and replaced the broken part at a very fair price. That's amazing service."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I called and received a 'binding quote' for my move from Tennessee to Arizona. It was twice that price when the movers arrived (I had to go with it because I was expected in Arizona and didn't have time to go with another company). I've been trying to call and email them to deliver my furniture, but nobody will call me back. I'm beginning to wonder if they keep some of the furniture that they say they will move. I'm very disappointed.

Finally answered and told me his car broke down on I95. Meanwhile I heard he was in  Vietnam , liar. He said he would send his cousin , who did s shotty job and never  come back to do the second coat. Wasted my time and money. I am talking to my lawyer as we speak."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"The worst.  I sit and wait for my first visit scheduled from 8 to 10 AM.  I call at 10:30 only to find out that the ""kid"" that made the sale was from the summer sales program set me up in the summer system and now summer has ended.  So I was never on the schedule.

Unfortunately, they did not have the part I needed so they told me they would be back in the morning to fix they problem. However, they never came back. I called them and they said that the part was unavailable and they did not schedule any further service for me. I wasted a whole day waiting for a service tech that never showed up."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I called this property management to get a little more information on a property that I was interested in. After numerous calls, I finally got connected to Dominique Despointes. I have to say he was one of rudest realtors I have ever spoken to. Horrible experience, Like these people are sales people and they treat their customers with such disrespect. I would STAY AWAY from this property managment. They may have beautiful apartments/condos in their inventory but they do not have the brain capacity to understand the first rule of customer service."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Wow - a great team!!! From the owner to every employee they care about what they're doing. Though it took a little longer then I expected, they were honest, respectful, and caring about every aspect of my move. 
They were running late because of traffic- I received two calls with updates about where they were. A very heavy piece of furniture scratched the wall in a very tight corner (easy to fix), they couldn't have apologized more. They re- assembled everything perfectly!!!!!
Honest, hard working, caring - I couldn't be happier with them!!!!"

I would definitely use them again for any future home inspections."
Home Services,4.0,CG,Not pleased with my window tint. The guys at Roto Door did an excellent job!  They came out on time and did a great job. I would definitely use them again.

He went above and beyond to make sure that everything was working perfectly.
Home Services,1.5,CG,"This is a nice location, but the fact that you can't find a single apartment in the area is unfortunate.  The office staff is also very condescending, and you get to pay to speak to someone else in the office.  There are also several ""tickets"" for residents to get to the office, and it's a sign of the office to not be open all day long.  This is not a nice place to live, but it's"

Home Services,5.0,OR,"This company heard about my fiasco with Boise Garage door, and offered to come out and look at my garage door opener and see if it could be repaired.  They brought  a new circuit board, because i had been told mine was melted.  They ended up just tightening a couple of connectors instead of installing the new circuit board or trying to sell me a new garage door opener.  69.00 instead of 320.00.  I highly recommend them because they are honest and knowledgeable.  Thank you Overhead Door!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"BEWARE! Terrible experience w/ this company. Salesman, Jeff I believe was nice but that's where it ends & my awful experience begins. Purchased honeycomb blinds for my entire house & 4 out of the 10 were defective, they would go back up after being pulled down! After sending out a technician 5 times they still couldn't fix them & would not replace them or refund me. It was a serious hassle. The technician, Bob was truly nice but also a subcontractor they sent out. I will never ever do business w/ these crooks."
Home Services,5.0,OR,I recently stored my life long belongings with this well kept facility!! I was only there 5 months.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"They were great for the first year.  At the end of my contract they said there would be a change in price.  I thought the cost was going to go up a bit, but the quote was for more than twice what I had been paying.  When I asked them about it, the only answer was that it took longer than they anticipated to cut the lawn.  I've stopped using them.  They do great work, but be prepared for a price hike when your first contract is up."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I have updated my rating with Horizon to three stars as they have made good on their promise to address our issues.

C&C was great with communication and always showed up on time. Our leak was properly repaired and has held up after several rain and snow storms. We are very confident with their work and have recommended them to our neighbors. If we ever need a roof job done or need a new roof they will be the company that we will work with.
Home Services,3.5,OR,Living here was fine but leaving was terrible. The apartments themselves were nice especially the large kitchen. Parking sucked but was bearable. The staff was very nice and helpful while I lived there. Unfortunately and what almost completely ruined it for me was moving out. After spending days cleaning and making sure the apartment was spotless we were charged for professional cleaning and carpet cleaning. Additionally they would not provide paint for touch ups so we were also charged for painting. If you live here don't expect to get your security deposit back.
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Please avoid them like a plague. Terrible communication. Terrible service. Had a plumber come out to fix an issue and only broke it even more and won't come back to fix it. Called the next day and they are refusing to send anyone else unless we pay ahead of time. They are also not returning any of our calls and each "" operator"" we speak with tells us they are the manager and don't know why we are calling. 
We now need a new, competent plumber to fix what the other one broke."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"If you're looking for a cleaning service company that does an amazing job, look no further. I've gone through companies that just do the minimum for your money, but A1 Expert is anything but that. The small company is run by a nice woman who is so dedicated and hardworking. She left my house spotless and I had no idea it could look that good. If you're looking for a cleaning company in the Bucks County/Philly area, definitely give her a call. I believe they do offices and deep carpet cleaning, as well."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"They are doing tree work in our neighborhood, which has a narrow road to get through.  I'm just trying to get  out and go to work and I get yelled at with obscenities to ""hurry the F up and go, go, go!! this is F-ing ridiculous!""  I personally will make sure I will never use your company to trim any trees at my house!  I was trying to be careful going through since they were all standing in the road and to get yelled and screamed at is unacceptable."

Not sure if the dishwasher was in the shower or not. We had a very large pool table with 4 tables. The pool was not a big place to have the pool table. They did a great job cleaning up after us. We would not use them again.
Home Services,1.0,CG,"This company borders on criminal. We have had an issue with them in the past, but this one is a different story. The office staff is very rude, and the only reason we signed up for this is because we were unhappy with the way things are going with our lease.

The person who answered the phone was friendly and eager to help. Within an hour (as promised) they arrived and unlocked the door for $200. I would definitely recommend this company whenever you need a locksmith - especially in those emergency situations."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Great company! DUDE was simple to schedule when many other companies needed several weeks notice. They are organized, on time, and efficient. They moved us from one house to another. Not an easy task for a family of four. The guys at Dude are professional and prompt. Moving can be a stressful process, but it's definitely made simpler with an awesome company like Dude I Need a Truck. We loved their service and will recommend them to friends and family who are in ""need of a truck."" 

Mahalo Dudes for all your hard work!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Tom's crew did a SUPERB MAGNIFICENT JOB renovating pretty much my whole apt. Everything was done with precision and perfection.  Israel and his crew took their time to make sure everything was done correctly.  He had to tile both the kitchen and bathroom floors. When he was unsatisfied with the kitchen floor, it was uneven, he redid some tiles until he was satisfied.  I can't rave enough about his professionalism and hard work. I highly recommend Tom Brennan but definitely ask for Israel. He is the BEST AT WHAT HE DOES."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"The plumber was a little late, but at least the company called us and let us know that they were running behind. Our plumber was Clint, and he was very professional and pleasant. He answered all of my questions without seeming condescending, and he was very kind about taking care of the mass of dead bugs we found under our improperly sealed toilet (which I absolutely appreciate). In all, the job was done in a decent amount of time, and he was very thorough in his execution. Added bonus: the price was very reasonable!"

When I come home to a catastrophe or no running water, you can't get anyone. Call/text/email/online maintenance request. It is all ignored till the following afternoon. They are not kind or fair in any way. Hire maintenance people that will pick the phone up after 5pm.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"STL Chimney responded quickly to my request for a quote and booked the chimney sweeping as soon as they had an opening. They called before leaving, arrived 5 min early, and finished 10 minutes before they estimated. The house was spic and span afterward, they were incredibly efficient and professional, and they even gave tips on getting the most out of our fireplace. 

They observed all mask wearing precautions. 

I was left feeling that if STL Chimney was in charge of more of the world, it would run a hell of a lot better."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I have been living here for 8 months now and have had cockroach and sewer fly infestations on more than 1 occasion. 3 to be exact. The front office refuses to do anything about it except schedule the ""exterminator"" for the following Tuesday. All they do is come in and spray some solution in a  spray bottle down the drains. How about actually cleaning them? 6 weeks in and no solution. I tried to discuss a prorated rent for April because of this and management doesn't want to discuss it or answer emails."
Home Services,4.5,OR,We called My Plumber because of the great reviews and availability on a Sunday. Bernie answered our call on a Sunday and diagnosed the problem over the phone and gave us instructions on what to buy and how to attempt to solve the issue to save us some money. He diagnosed the problem correctly (clogged main) but we were unable to fix ourselves and sent someone right over when we called on Monday morning. Everyone we interacted with was extremely kind and helpful. The issue was solved quickly and without too much financial damage.

They kept insisting that they had paid when in fact they paid taxes on the wrong property Id number, to some where in North Carolina I live in Illinois.  Wracked up a ton of fines and the county had my house set for sale and they just kept arguing that they had paid.  I had to get the VA involved before they would help me get it straight."

I recommend him for any job, large or small. Our project was a big one that took two days. His bid was comparable to three others but Brian stood out because of his knowledge and expertise. He doesn't just cut down trees, he sculpts them, makes them harmonious with their surroundings and does what is best for a long, healthy life. Don't hesitate. Hire him and his crew."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"The reason Horizon advertises so much in print and TV is because they charge at least 20% over normal service providers.  In most cases they won't quote prices on the phone but want to get into your home.  I needed a water heater and their price was 50% more than Lowe's.  When I challenged them they went thru a routine like a car salesmen called   the manager who agreed to lower the price.  Although they do respond quickly, I feel sorry for seniors who fall prey to them."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We couldn't be happier with Ray and his crew. They painted out entire condo from top to bottom (literally - ceilings, doors, pantry doors with hundreds of little slats on them, trim, etc) in preparation for us selling it. I have always painted the interior of our home myself as I'm really picky and it's cost efficient. However, I don't plan on painting ever again after using RG Painting! Not only was the work outstanding & meticulous, but we felt he was very fair and transparent in his pricing. Good communication too."

However, in our experience this is not a company you should pick for anything other than a few boxes or light item moves, not even two bedroom apartments.

He was personable, professional and even called the next day to make sure things were working well.  I would highly recommend Boise Dryer Vent Cleaning!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Bent Nail did a fantastic job on our home inspection. They noted everything small and large and provided helpful photos in their report.
They found a water leak and I wanted more information about the possible extent of damage and repairs needed.  Charlie called me and discussed at length the findings and answered all my questions.  He provided extra photos of the area under the leak to which helped me know that the leak was small and not extending into the  crawl space and subflooring.
I will use Bent Nail again and recommend them highly."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"I was driving this evening on Falls of Neuse and the truck with this logo on it was driving erratically. They sped up to the point they were dangerously close, so I turned on my signal to change lanes and they were going back and forth between the lanes not using a turning signal. After I was finally able to change lanes, the driver sped off at a high speed. Not a very great way to advertise a business...

Edit: The truck said Kea and son but this is the page that comes up in a search"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"We have used McGill Plumbing over the past 7 years and we have had exceptional service.  We had Mike L. out the past two days to help with a big leak problem under the kitchen cabinets.  He identified the problem, and worked for 4 hours to tear out the plumbing and replace an old (55yr) drain pipe that was cracked.  Mike is knowledgeable, pleasant, and very professional.  He solved our problem and could not have been nicer.  He is really a credit to McGill.  Thank you Mike, you are terrific!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,They are the best home inspectors around!  I was recommended to them through my employee home purchase assistant program.  Neil was extremely thorough with his inspections and truly walked me through every step of my first home inspection.  Their reports are very detailed oriented and they provide valid recommendations.  They truly had my best interest at heart and saved me a lot of issues that I would've encountered if I didnt choose them as my home inspector.  You get more than what you pay for!  Thanks again Neil & Fred!
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I had the greatest experience with Zippy Shell! I moved from New England to Tennessee and could not have been happier with the pickup, customer service and drop off. The national customer service rep (Autumn O.) was super helpful and followed up with me routinely.  She even coordinated for an out of the ordinary solution at the very last minute on moving day.  The total cost, even with the last minute change, was still less than the other major moving options.  Highly recommend Zippy Shell National to anyone moving short or long distances!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"11/23/2019...After a successful first experience, we hired Let's Get Moving for another move. This was a very large move with an excessive amount of boxes. It took Matt and a 6 man crew 7 hours. Every employee was polite, asked where things went and never complained (only after going up 23 stairs for the 100th time ).  Their pricing is competitive...you get what you pay for. I will pay a little more to keep my belongings in one piece. 

Thank you to Matt and his wonderful crew!!! May we never have to move again!!! Lol"

Home Services,2.5,CG,I had contacted this company and they told me they would fix it within 2 weeks. I said no.  They had to replace the valve and then the valve was not working.  The technician came and told me that the valve was working fine.  I told him I would have to pay a higher price because I didn't want to pay $100 more to fix the valve.  He said he had to install a new valve and replace the valve with a new one.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"The service was excellent from our relentless pursuit of the right shade of gray to the feel of the carpet, they were very patient. Allison was extremely helpful and her grandpa, Virgil stopped by to complete the measurements. I appreciate supporting a local business that is a family operation when the opportunity arises. We brought home samples which we were able to keep for a few days and try with different lighting. They even accommodated our request to install before the new furniture arrived. The installation went smoothly. We were very pleased with the price and quality."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Overall my living experience here is okay.  I like the atmosphere around the grounds and I am pleased with the quick and professional response from the maintenance and staff. I honestly do believe that the price if rent on the high side but after my research of the 1 bdrm apts. in the area , I concluded that  Chestnut Creek was the happy medium although I believe  rent rate is rather high for a 1 bdrm.  I can not  ask for a better atmosphere and accessibility to my daily travels and tasks."

Easy to work with he really works to understand what you wish to accomplish. He's been tinting my cars for over 15 years... 8 cars now - and they have all been flawless...

Hector's  attention to detail is remarkable... each window perfect - nothing but THANKS - GRATITUDE and AWE for a job well done..."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Lived here for 2.5 years.  I was ONE day late in the rent, they revoked my online access to pay and insist on a money order or cashier's check.  No courtesy notice.  No NOTHING.  Apartments need an overhaul for what they charge and it IS true that they go up in rent every year.  Be cautious before you choose to live here.  Some people have posted about parking.  There is a MASSIVE parking problem and the design of the complex is very poor leading to more of a parking issue."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"We were their clients in the past year and here is our experience:
Good: very responsive to emails and text messages, have good contractor list if repairs needed, have nice properties
Bad: moving out is a PAIN! we had professional cleaners and painters doing patching and cleaning, we had pre-final walk through and were able to correct all the items right after, however final walkthrough is done only by Eaton and we got smashed with additional cleaning fee and bunch of other things including admin fee of $85. Just be aware of that if you are renting with them."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I've used EMMCo twice in the past year for repairs to my 21 year old HVAC system. Both times the service was on time and professional. Most recently, Ed came out the same day I called them and was able to get me back up and running in less than an hour after replacing a bad capacitor. My interactions with EMMCo have left me feeling confident in their ability to  solve problems efficiently without selling me something I don't need. EMMCo will be first on my list when I replace my system. I highly recommend them."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I had another plumber in here this morning for a shower that was running pretty heavily. He couldn't stop the water and told me he would come back with a part during the week. I had previously called Kniese's but we hadn't made contact because my phone was misbehaving. So the plumber from Kniese's shows up at my door unexpected, stops the running water, replaces the broken part, and goes as if it were nothing. And now my shower is fixed and I don't have to pay for losing water over the next few days! Thank you!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Service by Ben was excellent, professional, friendly. Pipe at my fathers home was unclogged using their on truck water pressurized snake.

They told us that if we paid for the part we would get a ""free"" refund."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"My mother and I received EXCELLENT customer service when we visited the Cox store on Lapalco Boulevard in Marrero, LA.   Keisha gave us great customer service, assisting us with changing the name on the account from my deceased father's name to Mom's, and untangling an accounting error on Mom's bill.  For that matter, all of the customer service reps were kind an accommodating, holding open the door for us and pulling up a chair for my elderly Mom.  The attitudes of the Cox employees at this location gave the place a friendly, helpful aura."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"After part of our fence fell down in a storm, we needed someone to come fast and replace it. Javier and his team were immediately responsive and gave us a great bid, much more reasonable than any other we received. He built exactly what we described we wanted and the quality of the fence is amazing; we love the way it turned out. Left the job site spotless and was respectful and professional throughout. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Skip the big name fence companies and go straight to Javier to get the job done right."

David gave us great advice throughout the process and communicated with us every step of the way. He was a strong advocate for us, making sure we got the best deal possible. Knowledgeable, friendly, professional- would recommend him highly!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"We've had windows and doors replaced by Power. They arrive when they promise, do an excellent job, and leave the place cleaner than when they found it. 

Having dealt with other contractors--and especially seeing how contractors would either ignore agreed-upon start dates and the like...Power is an anomaly. Their consultants don't try to shove projects down your throat. Their process is consistent and professional. And the final products are sturdy, attractive, and energy-efficient. 

I give Power 5 stars because they exemplify what a home-improvement experience should be. They set the standard from which I judge other home-improvement providers."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Today is Friday the 13th and wouldn't know it my front door lock decided to quit working.  We could like the door from inside the house, but  not the outside.

Ben was able to come out and fixed my door lock today before 1 pm.  What service!!!

Now my family and dogs are protected.  Thanks Ben for your excellent and friendly service."
Home Services,3.0,OR,Gorgeous hotel and located right downtown which was perfect because to get to the arch or botanical gardens everything was only 15 mins away which wasn't bad at all! Looks straight out of a movie. The room was cleaned to perfection & we had a great view looking out into the Forest Park. The only bummer about the whole stay was that our thermostat even though it was set at 65 it was blowing heat & felt like 72 (I noticed a few other people had made this same comment). Overall great stay & would come visit again!
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We were looking to have a fireplace insert installed in our living room. After getting no satisfaction from two other businesses, we called Tubular George. Leslie was extremely helpful and listened to what we wanted, found an insert already in stock (something rare right now given supply chain issues), and within a couple of weeks we had an insert installed. It only took a couple of hours to put in and we're more than happy with the result. Everyone at this business was helpful and professional and we're more than satisfied. I'd recommend  Tubular George without reservation."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We have lived in the Packard Motor Car building (a Reinhold property) for over 4 years.  We enjoy the convenience of the location and many of the ammenities the building provides.

The property is generally well-maintained and well managed.

We do have a FEW gripes - the most significant being the energy-wasting drier that is very, very old and will not be replaced.

Other than that, we love our gorgeous apartment (many units have been recently renovated and look great) and enjoy living here.

The application process was simple and fast, the web portal for paying rent and submitting service requests is great, but, above all else, the level of customer service is exceptional. I always get a response to service requests within a couple of hours and the team is always very friendly about them.

If you want to rent with a property management firm that really goes above and beyond for the tenants, RCP can't be beat."

Home Services,2.5,CG,What is with this organization? We have been with them for two years now and have been through multiple management changes. The management is the most unprofessional and the management is the least responsive to our needs. We have been in a situation where they have been rude and patronizing.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"They can't seem to get their act together, trash is not consistently picked up.
When you let them know, they give you their standard answer: I will pass this on to the person in charge of your area, then you NEVER hear from anyone.
This place is ripping apartment communities off, paying for a service that is not delivered.
My guess: when their bins are full they can't be bothered to go empty them and come get the rest of the trash. If there is room in the bin, lucky you, your trash is picked up.
C'mon people, stop using this useless company!"

The price was extremely reasonable and I would hire them again in a heartbeat.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

While this might seem counter-productive for Red Cap, the truth is this: if we have a plumbing issue that we can't tackle or don't have the time for, we WILL call Red Cap and specifically request Carl."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Moved in beginning of February and the apartments have a ton of natural light and a lot of closet space. The public spaces are maintained and cleaned regularly and everyone I dealt with from the leasing office to the front desk is super pleasant  to work with. When I had my showing, Nick was amazing. He was able to show me a range of apartments and was super knowledgeable and helped. He also helped with the application process all the way through. I would recommend you take a look at this place if you're looking for an apartment."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Extremely disappointed in this company!  We purchased a home in Seacrest Pines, Barnegat, NJ in 2017.  At that time, we received a signed copy of the HOA rules.The first year, we had no real complaints about the services provided by Associa, per the Rules.  The snow was cleared, our sidewalks and driveways salted.  Our lawns were kept. That ended this past Winter.  They refused to clear any snow under 3 inches and salt our walkways.  This Spring, they have refused to weed and mulch around the trees.  All part of their agreement."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"One of the worst, most-unreliable service experiences we've ever encountered. Been a Member of their veterans ""Hero's Club"" for several years. Every appointment commitment made by Scott's has been broken. Always an excuse. Always a no-show or late. Never a follow-up. Their lack of service ethos overshadows any opinion that we might give on the quality of their techs, as their techs simply never show up. We've even run this up their flagpole to their Service Manager (Jonathan) as well as Scott himself. Same story. Plenty of commitments, but always unfulfilled. Strongly recommend you avoid Scotts' at all cost."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I have used Roadrunner twice and I have been impressed both times by their service. 

The first time my car had gotten broken into and they drove to my work that same day and cleaned out the glass and replaced the windshield.

The second time a crack in my windshield grew so large that it spanned across the front windshield. They were completely booked that day and the following week, but April moved some things around they made time to come out to my work again and fixed the entire windshield.

The installer James did a great job too! So impressed"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Take your money someplace else. GTE is a total scam. Charge fees for every little thing and don't disclose. I had to close all my accounts after paying off my car loan and credit card because there were fees charged. And when I got my final check, they took $6 for that check! If the rep I chat online did his job and told me about the fee, I at least would be aware or had an option to go to a branch. And don't even get me started on the craziest security questions they set up for you."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I have gone here many times before.  I am always beyond happy with my sunless tan.  I am very picky and have been to many of the other sunless tanning salons in the city and I will tell you, they do not match up to Baked Sunless Tanning.  I just returned from miami. Its been over a week since I was airbrushed and my tan still looks flawless.  It survived the Miami sun, sand, pools, sweat etc.  Thank you so much. I am obsessed with this place and the owner is just the best!"
Home Services,5.0,CG,They were here today and had an amazing time. I will definitely be using them again!Great job! I had a house inspection done by the HVAC company and it was completed by the same person. The work was done in a timely manner and the inspection report was thorough and detailed. They also responded promptly and did a great job on my garage door. They did a great job with installing a new door and on my new garage door.
Home Services,3.0,CG,"You have to be kidding me. The guys at the front desk are also very nice and helpful.I had an issue with the fence.  The fence was not fixed.  The guy that came to fix it said it was a ""twist"".  He said it would be $100 a piece.  I said it would be $300 and he said it was $110.  He said it would be $50 and he would get it fixed.  I said I would not pay"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Don't purchase!

They won't return your call.

We just moved in and need a new mattress and we have yet to find a bed, so we're running out of time.We used this company to move our family in to a new home.

Home Services,2.0,CG,I recommend using them.  They have the best pricing and are always on time.  I highly recommend them.I had a house inspection done by the HVAC company.  The inspector came out and told me that the water heater was working fine.  He stated that he would call me back to see if I wanted it fixed.

Home Services,4.5,CG,Adrianne who took my first call on the day we moved out. She was very professional and helpful. She explained the process and the cost. The work was done in a timely manner and it was completed in a timely manner. The crew was friendly and professional. The house is spacious and very clean.

Home Services,1.5,CG,The keys were available at the store and the owner was very courteous and very personable. He explained the process and the cost. He then provided a quote on a 4 hour job.

Home Services,3.5,CG,Greatest service we could have asked for!  We just moved in and my husband and I just wanted a move in crew to replace our old HVAC unit. They were so nice and professional. It was a long process and it took a while to get everything fixed. We were very pleased with the crew and will definitely use them again!I lived here for a few years and I had to move to a new place.

Home Services,5.0,CG,"Definitely a high quality tinted & professional tinting. I will definitely use them again!I am a two-time resident of the area and have had a couple of great experiences with this company.  

First, they came out for my gas furnace replacement.  The first time I called them they were the most professional, courteous, and courteous.  They were able to come out to my house for my furnace replacement and a few other things.  "
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I had Bill Frusco plumbing out to my house last week for a major excavation job done where they needed to dig up my front lawn and curb. Not only did they get out right away to diagnose my plumbing problem they where a lot cheaper then the other 2 companies I got estimates from. They also had their A/C tech Anthony come out and fix my AC during the heat wave the same day. I love Bill Frusco plumbing techs and staff and will recommend them to all. 
Thanks again Bill Frusco plumbing you guys are life savers!

Home Services,2.5,OR,"Absolutely the worst restoration company I have encountered. The workers lied to me about what they were doing and never called ahead when coming to do the work. In addition they took days off in the middle of the week leaving me without a place to go while the home was being worked on. I am absolutely disgusted by this company and the animosity they have caused in my life. Stay away from this company at all costs, it's not worth it and being lied to straight faced makes me worry significantly about what they are doing in my home."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Kevin is an excellent granite fabricator. We found him through our general contractor and we were told through a large granite supplier in our area that he is outstanding. Kevin and his team installed granite in 9 different places in our home including the kitchen and bathrooms. Two years later, we are still very happy with his work. We had a small seam separate slightly in front of our cooktop. They fixed it beautifully within a week. Not only is Keven great at what he does, he is a very nice person. Many thanks to the whole 
Intelli Stone team!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"That place is really awesome. I'm just here for a week and I needed a space to work. It was in only place opened on a Saturday. They're actually opened 24/7. They have a huge clean space with a lot of light. The owner returned my call even though she was off in San Francisco. She was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating. I was so happy to finally be productive and get things done. The atmosphere is really conducive for creative work. I highly recommend the place. It's clear people there love serving entrepreneurs. They also have a podcast room."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"This is my second review of Peterman's and I rarely go to this extent, but I think this company is awesome. They had a complicated installation on our new A/C units (two) and spent 4 days getting it right. A few totally unexpected problems came up, and with good humor and hard work, the team kept at it until it was all fixed. We had several crews come out and each team was professional, thorough, and cleaned up completely. I really felt confident throughout that our quirky, complicated system would be handled well. Thanks, Petermans...you have our business for life!!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Well, now i better understand the earlier reviews, now that I have tried to do business by phone....actually in order to get my online access restored.  I called twice, and worked my way through the phone tree to be put on hold twice for over 15 minutes without live response.  So I cannot do business online or by phone....and had earlier been told that any online issues needed to be dealt with by phone.   I have much bertter communication with my primary banker that is located several states away....so much for local bank service and convenience."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Definitely use this company!!!! The same day I called to get an estimate to replace most of the screens that had been torn out of our very high pool cage, I had an appointment the next afternoon. The price was MORE than reasonable and the work was excellent!! Four days after the job was done, I was getting texts from other contractors that I had texted at the same time I contacted Jennings wanting to know if I still needed the work done, uh, no, because I called Jennings, a conscientious company! A contractor like this is a rare find!!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"These guys are aces.  This is the second time I've used their service.  The first time was to have a 70 foot Pin Oak pruned and opened up.  They did a quick and a beautiful job.  Even my neighbors have commented.  

This time I had them come over to remove four tree stumps in my backyard.  Dave showed up with this magical tree stump chewer-upper machine and had it done in 15 minutes!  Afterwards he pulled out the roots, cleaned and racked the area, and he was done.  It was impressive indeed."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"We owned a condo in Philadelphia and live on the other side of the country. JG became our property management company and we barely had to think about the property again. Small problems arose and they took care of them immediately. Any phone calls to them were answered within the hour.
After managing for several years we decided to sell. They were our listing agent. They took care of all of the cleaning and prep. Advised us on what we should and shouldn't do. It sold in 3 days. They did all of the signing on closing. The most painless experience."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Mark Lamerdin is the best mortgage consultant I have worked with. This isn't the first time working with Mark and I don't anticipate it will be the last. We have referred over multiple friends to go work with and they all have great things to say about him. 

Mark is very professional and is prompt at returning emails or phone calls. He makes sure to find the best option for your needs, he's very thorough and will find the best rate their is. 

I trust his opinion and his work. For this reason I feel very confident in his work."
Home Services,5.0,OR,Was browsing Zillow and actually found Team Rossi through that site.  They are a husband and wife team and from start to finish everything went perfectly! We were in the market for a home and saw that they had stellar reviews.  We couldn't be happier with having them help us through the buying process.  Honest and reliable!  Communication was on point and every aspect of the transaction was explained to us by either Justin or Tasha.  Highly recommend them if you are looking for a home or selling!  Great realtors but even better people!
Home Services,2.0,CG,I wish I could give this place zero stars because they are a joke!  I have lived here for two years and I am so glad that I have enjoyed the apartments.  The management is very professional and the rent is very affordable.  I would recommend this place to anyone!I had a 2 bedroom with a 2 bedroom poolette and a 3 bedroom with a 3 bedroom bath. I was very disappointed with the quality of the pool. The poolette was well made and the bathtub was very
Home Services,4.0,CG,"This is my first Yelp review. The only reason I've written this is to help people find their favorite places.  The place is great and the staff is friendly. The only other thing I would like to add is the fact that they have some dogs and cats.  The staff is always nice.  They also do some park visits and have a dog walk out every other week.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice, friendly place to live.We have used the SB Re"

I will definitely use them again if I have any other plumbing issues.We used them in the past for a home repair. They were excellent.

They were able to go to the house and fix a few things without having to do"
Home Services,2.5,CG,"These guys are the shits. They say you can't do business with them, but I have them. They are not the best people, but they're the worst. I have been dealing with them for over 2 years now. I am extremely disappointed. I called to speak with a manager about a maintenance issue. I was told it was a ""complex"" issue with a maintenance contractor. I called again and had to ask to speak with an additional manager. I received no response."
Home Services,3.5,CG,"I moved here one month ago. The guys were friendly, professional and did a great job. The building is small and the staff is friendly and friendly. The building is great and it's a nice place to live. The staff is very knowledgeable about the area and the area is very well maintained. The place is close to the park, which is nice. I think the staff is very nice and professional. The apartment complex is nice and nice too. The office staff is very nice and professional."

Home Services,3.0,CG,"One of the best feelings I have ever had about living here is that my neighbors are nice and we get a great deal. I am a bit of a prude when it comes to socializing, but I know that if I am going to enjoy living here, I will. The residents are a bit too nice to the point of being creepy, and they are a little too loud. I live in a very quiet neighborhood, but the two men I have spoken to in the past have shown me that"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"The leasing office waited until the last minute to call me back.  When I got home, they said that they had to get a hold of the leasing office to make sure it was ok with me.  It was clear that they were not listening.  After some waiting, I finally received a call from a representative at the leasing office.  I called back a few minutes later and he was able to get me a quote from the leasing office.  It was very easy to schedule the appointment for"
Home Services,4.0,CG,What a terrific lighting store. We have used them many times for our work and have always been impressed.I had an issue with the power meter and then the unit was stopped.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"We had an after hours emergency. We were lucky enough to have an experienced, courteous, and professional plumber come out. Services rendered after hours are charged a premium, but it was worth it. Our technician, JR was determined to solve our issue despite the rain he encountered while working outside at night. He got us back in business and even dealt with our landlord on the phone to explain all the work he did. Again, we were lucky to get JR, and even though we hope we don't need their services again, we will call on Billy the Sunshine Plumber again."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Never showed up. Said they were coming one day between 2:00 and  4:00 ...did not show, did not call. The next morning WE CALLED THEM to ask when they were coming to fix door..They said they would be here later in morning. I called at 11:15, left a message..did not get a call back. At noon my husband called them, they said 1:00..at 1:00 we called, and they said they had two more stops before us!! and they were not nice about it...Now trying to find someone else to fix door...waiting a week to get a door fixed is unacceptable..."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Integrity did an awesome job with our move and were very accommodating to our timeframe. They even worked with me when I under estimated the inventory list for a flat rate quote and still offered a very fair price. The crew who did our move was Daniel, Tayrell and Kevin. They were hardworking, professional and friendly. They got our move done prior to starting a long out of town job and I never felt like they were rushing to get my job done or that my move wasn't getting their full effort and attention. Would recommend Integrity Moving Service to anyone."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"The salespersons were courteous and knowledgeable. The showroom had a large selection of floors. We thought we made the right choice until the time of installation. There was confusion about parts needed. The installers did not bring necessary tools and had to borrow from us without asking first. When they finish, they forgot to put these tools back. We still don't know where these small tools are -- perhaps on their truck. There was sloppiness throughout the job. I would still recommend shopping for material there, but when it comes to installation, don't be persuaded by the show. Hire someone separately."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Mark's professionalism and work ethic was one of the reasons we were so enthusiastic about the property he showed us. He was kind and waited for us to see a property, even though I was 30 minutes late. He is very patient and follows through with everything he promised to ask on the property for us. The only reason we weren't able to sign a lease was the commute was a bit further than we anticipated and decided to live closer to work; otherwise, I would have signed a lease with Mark. Definitely recommend contacting Mark for any questions or concerns!"
Home Services,1.0,OR,"WORST MOVERS EVER!!!!! 
BEWARE!! 
DO NOT USE!!! 
Showed up hours LATE!! 
RUDE
Came up with one less man than I had booked!!!! 
They damaged several items of my furniture!!! 
They damaged the place we moved out of and the house we moved into!!! 
VERY SLOW!!!! Had to help them move!! 
Would NEVER recommend!!!! Wouldn't unload truck until we we paid! 
Just threw stuff where they wanted!
They forgot stuff and then wanted to charge us more to go back and get it!!!! We had to pay someone with a truck after to get the things they forgot!!!
They didn't pack the truck right either!!!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I don't know how else I can express my gratitude for this company. I had an interesting and complicated job that I needed to accomplish and they provided A+ customer service from the initial message to the end.

The owner personally responded to all of my Yelp messages in an expedient manner, the crew provided updates to me as they were en route, and even throughout the moving process they were transparent, courteous, and very friendly.

I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking to hire a moving company. Thanks again for being not only an awesome company, but incredible human beings!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I have had mold in my apartment walls for two months because they can't be bothered to fix the problem (which is their fault) correctly. Please PLEASE don't live in these apartments. They may look nice on the surface but that is the extent of it. The management company fails to mange and or maintain these properties while you're in them. We had a broken kitchen sky light for 3 weeks, we had a flooded bathroom and broken hot water heater for three days. We have mold they they have spent months ""evaluating"" as a result of the flood water heater."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"My big toe could run this apartment complex better than these morons. Replace the whole management immediately. They're actually so bad at their job its kind of funny. THEY Never listen to the complaints given by their clients, they just like to give out their number to call like its gonna change something. They also have a nice beautiful heroine addict park located down the street. FOR ANY STUDENT/PARENT considering this place do yourself a huge favor and WALK AWAY. Its a trap , ALL OF IT.Just read the other reviews i don't need to explain myself. This place is poop."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"First and most important, our fence is great.  The lower rating is because of poor communication throughout. Knowing COVID may have been a factor, I gave a lot of leeway during the long  wait to have the fence installed. But once it was finally completed, all communication has ceased. It took several requests before the remaining bricks and sand blocking my driveway were removed over a week after the install. I've sent numerous texts and emails asking for a final receipt for my tax records.  I haven't gotten a single response.  Seems like such a simple request."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I just got charged $ 446. 00 to change a $5 capacitor. I can't afford to take off another half day and I needed my AC working because I have animals, otherwise I would have called someone else. The technician was friendly and he showed up on time, but he spent less than an hour on the entire job. Let's be overboard and say the capacitor ( or as they call it a "" voltage storage device"" ) costs $ 50. 00. That means I paid $394. 00 for a service call that took less than an hour. You can do better."
Home Services,5.0,CG,I had a drippy shower and an unpleasant odor coming from the shower. I called the local store and they said they had a technician out. He said the odor was coming from the toilet. I called and told them that the toilet was dirty. He then said that it was coming from the toilet. I told him I didn't want him to be the one to clean the toilet. He said I didn't want him to be the one to clean the toilet. I said I'm not going to pay

I will also be calling the office to schedule a response and they will not honor their contract.  I will be calling them again and will be waiting for them to return my calls. "
Home Services,4.5,CG,I was looking for movers and a professional movers. I chose G&G because of the great customer service. The office staff was friendly and helpful. I was very pleased with the service and the crew. I would highly recommend them. I had a problem with the machine and a 2 year old was going to be in the house for a month. After I called G&G I had to call them to try to get someone to come out to fix the problem.
Home Services,3.5,CG,"My Ford Focus steering wheel and an electric motor. I will definitely be using this company again. I had an issue with the power meter and then the unit was stopped. I called the company and was told the issue was a ""mistake"" but I was still waiting for the repairman to come out to look at it. I had to call the owner to come out and get a hold of the owner and he was not able to get me back to the owner until later that day."
Home Services,4.5,CG,"We had the motor in the garage and the AC in the basement. When I got home, the AC was not working and the motor was going out the back of the garage. The garage door was broken and the garage door was not working. I called and spoke to the owner who said he was looking at replacing the motor and that I had to call the owner to come out. I called again and had to call him back and he said he was looking at the AC and that he could come out today"
Home Services,5.0,CG,I've taken several vehicles to this place and they are all very professional. They have a large collection of items so we had to get our stuff to the cleaners. There are a lot of items that are either in the truck or in storage. There are also several items that are not in the truck. There is a lot of trash in the storage areas and it is a lot of trash. I just went there to pick up a few items. It was all a good experience. The service was very friendly
Home Services,1.5,CG,Wearer! The company does not know what the customer needs. I will not recommend them to anyone.Great job! Great crew! I am a HOA member and have had great experiences with this company. I have been in business for over 20 years. This was my first time using them and I was very pleased with their service and quality of work. I would highly recommend them to anyone.We had a problem with our gas heater and we called Electric Plumbing. They came out within an hour.

Home Services,1.5,CG,"Total con job! Misdiagnosed.  Not an easy job, but I will keep my word!Very rude. I called them the next day, and they said the service was canceled.

I called them the next day and they said they will be able to cancel my service. I called again the next day and they said they will not be able"

I would recommend him to anyone looking for a great photographer.I have used the All Things Green sign over the past several years. I have been a loyal customer for over a year now and am very pleased with the service I received.  The company is friendly,"
Home Services,2.5,OR,I also have not had a good experience with Next Level when we first moved into our house we had gorgeous thick St Augustine grass.....as time went on it became invaded with Bermuda grass which was all as a result of this company not caring and just cranking out as many lawns as possible we went back and forth for a while to try and work with them to make this right. Long story short they did nothing and liened our property because we refused to pay for their services considering how expensive it was going to be to fix their mess
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Had them come to check a leaking drain pan in my air conditioner.  When the technician arrived he looked at the unit for 2 or 3 minutes and said to me "" man this is the worse news I had to give anyone today.  Your drain pan Is connected to the unit and the only way to fix it is to replace the whole unit.  Quoted $8233 (10%disc for check or cash).  Got a second opinion next morning...$1068 later drain pan replaced.  Don't know how this guy sleeps at night.  Would NEVER recommend them to anyone."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"We hired Synergy for alarm services and committed to a three year contract.  At the end of the contract, they refused to cancel the contract, despite over 20 calls and emails providing them with exactly what they requested for cancellation.  Throughout the 3 years of service, they were unprofessional and disorganized, and consistently overcharged us (charging an auto pay and also claiming we had to pay by check).  Stay away from this fraud of a company.  Once we were finally able to cancel, they continued to charge us even though we have all of the paperwork confirming cancellation."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Been here almost two years! Maintenance is awesome, management is not the greatest, they say their pet friendly, but their not! They were, but that changed. A lot of conventions at hotel, so as a tenant you deal with that. They bring the packages to your door, which is awesome. Floor plans are not the greatest, a tad outdated. The views are amazing! But I would not recommend unless you go into this knowing you are locked in to your lease no matter what! They don't care if your broke, lost your job. whatever! No compassion; I understand a business, but."
Home Services,4.5,OR,Dr a Draft said he would come and seal my home making it look like he wasn't there. Not the case the work he did to seal the air cracks in my home was extremely shotty. Looks like an amateur took a caulk gun and now I have clear weatherstripping on my hardwood floor and my baseboards look like caulk was just put all over them. I would not recommend. Way overpriced and not a professional job that you would expect on what he's charging. It's caused me more work to do and cleanup after his visit. Beware of the fake reviews.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I was so impressed by Richard Caby with The Chad Borah Team!  He was so friendly and professional!  We met right after work and he showed up with bottles of water, snacks and chairs because we were in a vacant house!  He went through every inch of the house.  Found a few pretty major things wrong but assured us they were all very fixable - and they are!  He did a great job of not alarming us with small things, but pointing them out just to be sure we saw them.   I highly recommend them."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We needed multiple ceiling fans installed. Our first contact was Karen who answered the phone and was friendly and helpful. Corey was dispatched and couldn't have been more professional, competent and fairly priced.  He had everything installed in less than two hours. 

He then asked if there was anything else we needed help with. We had grown frustrated with the electrician sent by our home warranty company who after three visits couldn't solve our electrical issues. We asked him to take a look. Within 10 minutes he had traced the problem and had it fixed. 

Highly recommend and will use again."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Came out to fix a couple of refrigerated units in one of our break rooms. He ""repaired"" the units, and told us we should be all good. We paid. (BIG Mistake)
Within an hour BOTH units we had him repair were not holding temp. I called and the wife said Rick would be back out in the morning. Well, of course no one showed. When we called back, she said he was arrested yesterday, and she had NO idea when he would be out to fix his mess. Of course he never fixed it... No refund either. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THESE CLOWNS!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Very rarely do I write reviews. Service has to be exceptional. This company, and particularly Brandon, deserves high praise for going above and beyond. Not only did Brandon explain everything that I needed to know about my geothermal system (since becoming a widow now requires that I  take care of things I've never really needed to know before), but he also picked up and discarded from the basement an unwelcome dead mouse for me. Brandon gave me lots of good advice as well as to parts, & helped me get a missing screw from MiracleCraft. I could not be more satisfied!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I have lived at Elmwood Townhomes for the past 5 years.  With convenient access to major amenities such as WEM, hospital, and transit you'd expect to constantly be hearing traffic - not the case. The onsite maintenance are reliable, friendly, and knowledgeable - any small issues that have been reported were fixed between 1 and 48 hours. The ability to pay rent by debit at the onsite office is extremely convenient - and the management staff are always helpful, friendly, and greet me by name (impressive with over 200 units). The common areas are spacious and well maintained all year long."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"First time I used movers. These guys were great. Best price by far I heard when I was doing research. They really do work quickly to get the job done as soon as possible. 

I thought my massive couch wasn't going to fit into the doorway to my apartment, but they saved the day! They came with their own tools, took the pegs off, and willed it through on their necks and heads to my living room. 

If my lazy Puerto Rican cousins ( so much for not believing stereotypes) can't help me next time, I will definitely use this place again."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Feeling lucky and grateful I found these guys. I've now used Branch Out tree care three times, and am really super satisified and happy. They are a pleasure to work with, on time, do an excellent job and are fairly priced. But what I really like is the experience that can be seen in how they operate. I have no idea how long the owner Chris has been doing this but he moves through the tree with grace, and just  knows what cut to make to get the goal accomplished and leave the tree looking beautiful. They are the best."
Home Services,4.0,CG,"These guys really know what they are doing. 

Thanks again for a great job!Great job! I had a house inspection done by the HVAC company and it was completed by the same person.

Home Services,1.5,CG,My AT&T  wifi went out on the weekend and they charged me $29 for the service call.   I had to call a number to get the service call back.

Home Services,4.5,CG,"I love these guys. I had an emergency emergency and they were able to come out within a couple hours.  They had a great look at the house, and the price was very reasonable.

They were the most professional I have ever had the pleasure of working with.We had a great experience with the company. We were on our way to a wedding and had a great experience with them."
Home Services,4.5,CG,"I drive alot for work and have never had a problem with it.

The person who came to my house had a nice look at the house, and explained to me how it was going to look in the next few days. The one thing he said to me was that I would need a 2 bedroom with a bathtub, which was $150 less than the price I paid. I was quite surprised to see that the guy that came to my house was even very interested in that. He explained that he"
Home Services,2.0,CG,"A man came to my house to explain the situation. He did not offer a fix, he just said that we had to replace our furnace and then the man showed up at my house to inspect it. 

He said that they had to replace our furnace and replace our water heater and a new furnace because the furnace was not working properly. 

I asked him if he could just give me a quote and he said that he could because he had already been there for about 10 minutes and would be"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"I have had a terrible experience with the company and they are a joke! They have been rude to me and have had to apologize for their poor customer service. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.We have been in business for over 20 years. We have always had great customer service. We have used them for our house cleaning, lawn maintenance, and auto repairs. We have also used them to repair our garage doors, doors and windows.

Home Services,2.0,OR,DO NOT LEAVE YOUR LOVED ONE HERE! This facility moved my father without my consent and never notified me that they had moved him to another facility. Three days later when we found out we went to collect his things and found that many of his items had been stolen. And the rest was thrown in a closet full of other people's belongings who were either deceased or were so terminally ill that they couldn't collect their belongings as well. I have video and pictures to support what I'm saying! if you care anything about your loved ones do not send them here
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Terrible place to rent from. Nothing ever gets fixed and they constantly give you the run around. I have rented my entire life and let's just say this is by far the worst experience I have had to deal with. Been there for a year and still after 7 people coming out I wake up once again without heat. Had put the furnace on emergency just to get any heat at all then got to pay $900,$800,$700 utility bills for months because of the furnace not working correctly. Slum lords is the true meaning of American Homes for rent. Save yourself the hassle!"
Home Services,1.0,OR,"My friend and I both had our apartments broken into when we lived here.  I really feel it could've been an inside job considering a few weeks prior I received a note under my door saying ""annual mandatory Maintence check."" Me being young and naive I thought that was normal but everyone I have talked to said it wasn't. Couple weeks after that ""maintenance check"" I was broken into. Then I set up an alarm system and one day it just so happened to be unplugged as if someone with a key got inside and unplugged because the alarm was going off."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Always clean and well organized inside and outside of the property, easy accessibility to all major highways. Staff is always friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The manager Dave is amazing and has helped my son and I so much over the past year. Any customer that comes in is always greeted with professionalism and respect. I would highly recommend this location. I met so many customers that were very happy with U-Haul locations around the US, this one especially. Thanks again to Dave and his amazing staff. I thank and appreciate you all very much. And thank you for working during this difficult time."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"We call Stuart Services with all of our household problems. They schedule very good technicians who address our issues politely and professionally.

Recently we had a plumbing problem and Scott from Stuart Services arrived on time and handled our problems quickly. He even took on an additional issue about which we hadn't told the dispatcher. 

Scott was courteous, very knowledgeable, and most importantly gave us trustworthy advice. He fixed the problems quickly and explained each action he took. He even helped to schedule an electrician to address some other concerns we had.

We'll be using Stuart Services for  a long, long time!! Thanks Scott."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I was very impressed with the level of professionalism exhibited by Leo and Beryl Project Engineering.  Leo's attention to detail ensured that I was purchasing a well constructed and remodeled home.  It was brought to my attention that he is affiliated with an organization that monitors construction on ""flipped"" homes....this added to the level of confidence that I have in my home inspection report.  

I also loved the booklet he provided with general information and timelines for home upkeep and repairs.  The listing agent was very impressed with it too and Leo kindly provided him a copy as well."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"The Install Team was Outstanding!
They maintained Covid 19 CDC guidelines. Sam, Mike and David were professional window installers. What a great contractor Window World is contracting with. The quality of work was excellent. Integrity is hard to find in any company in the area lately. I was very satisfied with the quality of windows and the Install team. Sam, David and Mike work well as a team. Four windows and two patio doors completely installed in five hours. Thank you Window World for excellent windows and doors. We appreciated the Outstanding Install team you employed. Thank you Sam, Mike and David."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"The guys at Carney Tree Service know what they're doing. We felt their pricing was fair. And the service was good. We would absolutely use them again. 

Our project involved 7 large pine trees. It was a big job.  

We had no urgent timeframe, so the Carney guys just showed up when they had enough time left in their work day. They would arrive at 1pm or 2pm and bang out 2 trees or so and wrap it up by 4pm. We had no issue with that, and it helped with their labor efficiency.  

We've used them before. We're very satisfied."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Eager to stay at the Chase Park Plaza after graduating from the nearby Washington U. Medical School 50 years ago, I was totally disappointed.
The decor is drab, dour, dated and depressing. 
Service is haphazard with requested morning newspaper not delivered, scheduled taxi to airport not noted and reordered, bathtub surface slick without grab bar or nonslip surface, and coffee for a very early morning flight out incurring a charge.
My impression is that cost savings are paramount for this hotel. Someone rang the doorbell in the morning asking if I wanted service - that is, removing used towels and making the bed. 
Stay elsewhere."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"So today, I went to DMV and got my new license plates and then drove to home depot nearby to get a screwdriver. That's when I came across two men who works for Desert Air plumbing etc. They were too kind to help me to change my plates on car and gave me two little screws to attach my license plate properly. This is what we need in this world. Help one another, and these two gentlemen did just that. Thank you again guys I think it was a Mark & Greg? My apologies I'm so bad with names. God bless you both!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Once again a beautiful clean up for Spring. We hadn't been able to put pots etc away in fall, so it was a big job for them to fix the yard & mulch!
We are a repeat customer. Much thanks to Colin who took all our requests & came out to check how the work was going. Angel & another gentleman did the job. We walked around with Angel and he was fantastic! He not only did what we want, but he taught us things about our plants and shrubs. They turn on & off sprinklers and do great stone work too."
Home Services,3.5,CG,I can't say enough good things about the guys at Reno Roofing. They were very thorough and thorough.  They had a lot of information and they were very honest. They were able to go over my roof and fixed a few issues that were not covered by our warranty.  The guys were extremely professional and very quick to respond to any questions.  They did a great job installing a new roof for us!  We will definitely use Reno Roofing again.This is a great place to live in Tampa Bay

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Our experience working with Fresh Coat of Santa Barbara couldn't have been better. They were able to start my project on fairly short notice, finished on-time, and exceeded my expectations in several areas. Firstly, the owner (Justin) met with us for a walk-through and consultation of our space. He is a very genuine, great guy who is on-point and efficient. The workers who actually painted, caulked and finished our space were great as well. They left everything very clean and perfected. I have gotten many compliments on our space and I am happy to highly recommend Fresh Coat for any job, big or small."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Had no A/C on Memorial Day, a holiday.  First time I called Progressive and the technician returned the call in 10 minutes, suggested some trouble shooting tips.  He called me back and advised he would be here following his current service call.  He arrived on the scene in 45 minutes, concluded the problem was a electronic part that needed to be replaced.  Once the part was installed, my system is running better than prior.  Reliable, responsive and great communications.  Pricing was very fair, especially on a holiday. Ahhhhh ice cold air once again, thanks to Progressive Air Systems."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"My thermostat wouldn't work so I called for a service call to have it diagnosed. They said they could have a certified tech come in between scheduled appointments but no set time and that it probably would be the next day. The lady was friendly and explained the process. Got a tech same day I called. Eric was polite, friendly, and patient (barking dogs and a crying baby). He was efficient, let me know what happened and fixed it. He waited to make sure everything was working properly. Also able to answer questions about Sierra Air products and services. Knowledgeable and professional."
Home Services,1.0,OR,Crooks!!!! Don't answer the door for their sales people. They will hand you a contract that says one thing and have you thinking u got it made with your bill for the next two years and then a month later they rack your bill up without warning! You already get nothing for your money! Then they tell u the only way to have your price back is to downgrade you tv even more!! Customer service is impossible! I feel like they conned me and now I'm stuck unless I pay double to get out!! My point tell them to go somewhere with their contract
Home Services,4.0,OR,"My outstanding review last week has disappeared! All I can say is you wont find any better selection or service. I was in there three times in the past three weeks and on two occasions there were customers everywhere yet I got excellent service. My tile man forgot to pick up a $40 piece of travertine and when I went back they could have said ""Too bad"". Instead without hesitation Bobby gave me the missing piece. Do not waste your time going anywhere else. Another plus is they allow you to take tile home before making a final selection; try that at Lowes etc"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Garbage disposal quit. Thought I needed a new one and had to get it fixed today or wait several weeks because I am going out of town. Called Mr. B. He was able to come out today, figured out the existing disposal was jammed but could be unjammed. While many would have just replaced the old one and hit me up for $500+, Mr. B was honest and saved me a bundle. Also showed me how to unjam this thing myself in the future and how to fix my soap dispenser. Very reasonable price, very prompt, helpful and professional. What more can you ask?"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Work in Progress but so far, awesome services! The entire team is REALLY good- we have a big project downtown and everyone has been doing a good job.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"I'm only giving them a three star because the staff was helpful.  We actually didn't wind up staying there, although we had a reservation for two nights.

We were looking for a hotel that allowed dogs, so we booked a room, only to find out that we could only stay in a SMOKING ROOM.   I mean, this is California, where no one smokes, and they could have at least posted it on their website if that is their rule.

So we had to find another hotel for the two nights we were there.  :-(

They did give us a refund, which was nice."
Home Services,5.0,OR,These guys are awesome!!!! I had them put my unit in and they did a great job. I had problems with the unit and they came and fixed it right away.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I had a hard time finding a place in Philly.  Maybe it was my brown skin and beard or low credit score.  That all changed when I tried Fishtown real estate.  At first I was skeptical of ""Derek"" he looked like some tall, privileged, typical bs, douchey, sales men.  Like the ones that swindled my ancestors for their land!  However Derek proved to be a cool hard working dude that helped me find a home for both my families.  He even kept things discreet, so my wife never found out.  Fishtown is as real, as real estate gets!"

She never settles when searching for your next home. Her honesty and knowledge keep you fully informed when house hunting. Her years of experience, marketing and connections also come into play when she is getting your home sold.

I would and have recommended Karen to anyone looking to find their next new home or looking to sell their current home or property.

She helped us find our forever home and sell our starter home keeping us informed all the time."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I am extremely pleased with the work done by Umbrella Roofing.  Jose, the owner, came out to look at some storm damage that was done to my clay tile chinked roof.  Not every roofing company can work on this type of roof.  He found the cause of the damage and gave me a reasonable estimate to repair the roof and remove some of the tree limbs near the damage.  The work was done very professionally by Hector the following week.  I am glad I have found this company and I would definitely use them again and recommend them to others."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Our polybutelene pipes were overdue to be replaced - we felt within another year or so they would have leaked on our newly installed laminate floors.
Cummings came in the higher of our bids but did it very much more efficiently than the others were able to do, so we went with them.  {We had newly installed counters in the kitchen so we wanted the cabinets to stay on the wall for instance]!
Very good work, very thoughtful of our need versus their own, and a pleasure to have around.  Excellent value for money, and hard workers who came daily and got the job done."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"These guy really do care about clients, i don't think I've had anyone as honest as these guys...called them in to check out why my room was always so humid and why mold would randomly appear. A week later they came to do the consultation and informed me what the issue was and gave me the solution on how to do fix it! (Quick fix also) well they told me i would receive a quote later on in the day never got one but its been 2 weeks and i have not had any humidity problems!!! Consultation was free so was the advise!! Thank yall!"
Home Services,1.0,OR,"I'm another victim of a poorly run HOA that contracts with this terrible company. Their employees have no respect for personal property. They will just mow over garbage and shred it everywhere. They're always kicking over my solar lighting and never put it back. They don't pick up any of the debris they hack down. They pick and choose what to trim, yet leave most of it overgrown and poorly maintained. My lawn looks awful and is very spotty. They recently did some huge project to dig up old drainage systems, but barely did anything to cover it up. Overall, bad service and communication."

If I need any form of photography, Gerardo is the first and only person I will think of. He's everything you could ever ask for in a photographer.

-Organized
-Talented
-Prompt
-Innovative 
-Passionate

The amazing thing is that he is completely self-taught. I can barely figure out my point-and-shoot... I don't know how he learned everything on his own, but it's a credit to his determination. 

Gerardo aka Herardo aka Gerry is a man of many names and many talents. He's the man, the myth, the legend when it comes to photography."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I highly recommend Serrano's Heating & Cooling LLC.  While out of town we noticed something wrong with the AC Unit as the Nest App read 85 in the house.  My brother in law stopped by our house and was able to determine it was a bad condenser motor.  The next day (within hours of first contacting Serrano's Heating & Cooling LLC) Ramon met someone with our house key and replaced the bad condenser motor.  Thank you Serrano's Heating & Cooling LLC, we were happy to come home to a new condenser motor and a cool home during a triple digit week."

I have used many of these guys in the past, and I have never had any issues. The staff is always friendly, and they are the most professional I have encountered. They are very careful with all of my stuff, and they are able to go to any location they like. They are very efficient, and have the most affordable prices."
Home Services,2.0,CG,"The diagnostician did a thorough job of diagnosing the problem.  

The person who came to my home had a very bright and professional attitude, and was very careful with his work.   

He was able to fix the problem with only a few screws and a small amount of electrical tape.  

I would recommend him to anyone looking for a reliable and reliable professional.  

We are very pleased with the service and will continue to recommend him to friends and family."
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Worst customer service. After being locked out, they re-entered our home for the day and we had to call the phone. The office told us the office was not open and that we had to call the office in person.  The office told us it was still open and that we had to call the office to confirm it.  

They also told us we could not get any key from them and that they would not answer our calls. We were very upset. We had to pay another $75"
Home Services,1.5,CG,I called to request a quote on the AC unit. I was told that the guy was rude and that I had to call the company. He then said he would be back in a couple days. I told him that I am not going to be going with them. He then said that I was going to have to call them and tell them to call me back. He then said that he was going to call me back. I asked him if I could call him back so that he could cancel the order.

I would highly recommend this company.I had an issue with my furnace. The tech said he was looking at a different furnace and needed to make sure the furnace was working properly. After asking for a different furnace he said he was going to go ahead and replace it. I had to go to the furnace company for a refund.
Home Services,4.5,CG,Used old city twice. First time it was an inch above the ground. Second time the sewer line was twice as long. The second time it was half the length of the first time.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"You'll get customer service at Mohawk, until the next customer comes through the door. I walked and explained that I need to pick out a tile that could be delivered within 1-2 weeks as we are down to the studs in our renovation of our master bath. The sales lady helped me for 20 minutes and then dropped me like a hot potato when a male customer came in. Turns out, he was in the market for $2 sq ft tile and walked out without buying. I walked out too, went to Devon Tile, received wonderful assistance and made my selection to the tune of $6,750."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Ken, his father, and their team did an excellent job staining and refinishing our ""vintage"" 1980s basketball court yellow hardwood floors throughout our kitchen, dining room, and living room. To be honest, the polyurethane bubbled in several areas, but they returned the next day to make it right, and even took off an amount equal to the cost of the extra night we had to stay out of the house while the fumes dissipated. The floors truly look amazing. I highly recommend Thomas Hardwood Floors, not just because they did great work, but also because they made it right when things went wrong, which does happen."
Home Services,2.5,OR,This was the worst moving experience ever! I was quoted on the phone by Matt and then when the guys showed up and were done moving it was double the amount! This place is a scam! Guys did a great job moving but the King Bee Matt seems to be a scam artist. Even his own guys that work for him say the same thing! He quotes people before hand then when the guys get done he tells his guys a completely different amount! I called and just told him my frustration with the whole ordeal and he threatened me! Avoid this place at all cost!
Home Services,5.0,OR,Thank you Williamson's Heating & Cooling!  I set up a service for my parents to have their heating and cooling system serviced to provide them with peace of mind that the units were still in good working order in the foreseeable future.  John was our service technician.  I was impressed with his professionalism and polite manner with my Mom.  It is super important to be able to have a level of trust with your service provider.  John explained everything he did during the service call as he reviewed the heating and AC units.  We are very pleased.  Thank you.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I had many quotes for the move and I was so glad to have decided hiring these guys. They are the best. They were very flexible and accommodating to my requests. They moved fast and efficiently yet very detail oriented and careful with the furnitures. They had to climb stairs with heavy loads, yet they had no complaints. They are a quite bunch, yet extremely professional and cheerful. What made me feel really good about them is their attitudes. They even complimented me for doing a good job packing, when they were the ones who did all the heavy lifting. I would definitely hire them again."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"After waking up to water everywhere, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do. My insurance agent told me that I could hire anyone that I wanted. I went onto Yelp to see if I could find any good companies. I contacted IRS and Preston came out to my house immediately. He walked me through the process, started work that same day, and handled everything for me. They worked with my insurance company and I had nothing out of pocket (besides my deductible). I couldn't be more pleased with Preston as he was timely, professional, courteous, and clean. I would highly recommend IRS to anyone!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"When we needed our basement waterproofed in the fall we reached out to several places and they were all scheduled out too long for just estimates. Basement Guru's was able to come out the same day for the estimate and was even able to start work a week later. The job only took two days due to the thoroughness, diligent and meticulous work that was done by Basement Guru's we were even able to recommend them to our neighbors down the street. They had the same exact experience when it came to the estimate and work starting and being completed. I would recommend them to ANYONE!!!!"

Home Services,1.5,CG,The absolute WORST place to live. The only reason I've stayed here is because I was just blown away by the crew and the quality of the work they did. I was very impressed with the customer service and the professionalism of the manager. I wish I had stayed here two years ago.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"Perhaps one of the worst house cleaning experiences one could have. 

Once we went through the debate of what they will not clean and why (they approach the job with serious attitude), they went about their work. 

They spent nearly two hours on the top part of my house and other than making it smell nice for a few hours, I'm still trying to figure out what they did for two friggin hours. 

They told me that my family room would have to be done on a separate visit. 

What?  I paid you to clean my house, now you're doing half the job and walking away???"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I would not recommend renting here. The staff is just flat out incompetent.  Ethan I believe his name is, was a horrible leasing agent. Not only did he make my wife extremely uncomfortable I heard him refer to other tenants as ""fags"" which I felt was extremely unprofessional. My wife and I were ready to lease a 3 bedroom unit upon our arrival but after the comment that was made we never want to step foot back at this place again. The complex may appear to be pleasant but once you deal with the staff, or at least this agent it was just a horrible experience."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We had an outside pipe break and they sent someone over within the hour. Their plumber was courteous, sympathetic and very competent. It was very cold out yet he worked in the dampness, digging down three feet to get to the pipe. He had to leave to get insulation and came back late afternoon to surround the pipe so it wouldn't freeze that night.

I'm very impressed with this company, from the owner to the employees. They're helpful and Rick was absolutely affable in the face of cold, cold water and the prospect of digging.

I would absolutely call this company again. In fact, I wouldn't call anyone else!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Searched the web. Home Advisor and Angie's List. Was not impressed with what I found. Searched window replacement. Found Beautiful Homes Nevada. Called and set up an appointment. 
Adam came out and made his presentation. WOW! What a thorough presentation. Answered every question my wife and I had regarding the windows and installation. 
The installation crew arrived, and with-in two hours, the windows were installed, the left-over debris and old windows were removed and the inside and outside of our home was as spotless as it was before the installation. UNBELIEVABLE!  What a crew and what a company. 
Very, very impressed. I recommend this company highly!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Pros: 
Love the look of my apartment and the maintenance staff is wonderful. 

Cons:
So loud! The walls are paper thin and since floors are concrete there is no cushion when walking around and I could hear my upstairs neighbors walking around and every time they dropped something. Also, if you love the sound of trains all through the night, then this is the place for you. If not, avoid living here. Three different tracks run near the apartment and you can hear them at random times. 

The saw dust was also bad. My allergies would randomly flare up because there would be sawdust all over my stuff."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We were looking to have some vents moved, a exhaust hood run outdoors, a new humidifier, thermostat etc.  Travis scheduled us quickly for an estimate and provided a detailed itemized estimate within 24 hours.  After choosing them to do the work it even got better!  The way the office staff contacts you is exceptional!  The 4 men that came to the house had never seen the project and worked quickly and efficiently.  They all were great people.  And finally they were patient in showing us how to use our new thermostat!   If you need HVAC work check them out!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"UPDATE - Horizon followed up immediately following my initial review. A third technician was sent to look at our system.  He took the time to take photos and while there was indeed some rust from the flooded humidifier, the system is not in danger of failing us. In speaking to the third technician to show up, I believe that the difference in what I was told reflects personal bias of the other two technicians and what they would do to remedy the issue, if anything. I commend Horizon for sending a third person to resolve things and I do feel my original issue was adequately explained."

Home Services,3.0,OR,I had my system for over a year and its been the best decision ever.  Its amazing how easy it is to install at your home with no money down.  Plus how amazing it is to have one payment throughout the year and not get surprised by TEP with $300 in the summer.  I was very skeptical about doing this until I had a consultation at home and saw all the benefits.  I did do research and saw all the bad reviews and decided to do this one that way you can see how simple and beneficial it is to go solar. Thanks SolarCity.
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I would not recommend these Apartments to anyone but especially if you have children. The water is shut off all the time, repairs/maintenance takes so long and even when they come half the time the issue doesn't get fixed. It took them 6 hours to get the water out of my apartment when one of our neighbors flooded. Also this is the second time our car window was smashed in. There is suppose to be someone going around for security but now other windows are getting broken and no one has seen anything. I'm counting down the days till I can move. I'm really disappointed in these apartments."
Home Services,5.0,OR,My review is way overdue but I had both my vehicles fully tinted here some years ago the first was about 9years and more recently about 3years ago.  Excellent work and they stand behind it on some of the sharper corners they had me come back a few days after pick to smooth out and resolve any bubbles that didn't on their own(tiny). On my SUV superb larger more square Windows no no deep angles but beautifully balanced and cut no fading no peeling A+ .  Very uniform work and quality 3M & SolarTek materials as well as invisible shield for your front hood or fenders.
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Customer service is awful. Will not be back to this location. There were about 40 people waiting to talk with an associate & there were 4 associates total in the store. But one guy just stood there and was not helping any customers. The other associates would stand around and talk in between customers instead of getting the wait list down and helping the next person in line. After waiting for an hour, the man who had been standing around not helping anyone announced they had been all out of the product we were there for, and that there was nothing they could do for us. Very disappointed."

Through out the project his communication was outstanding, offering numerous recommendations that enhanced the appearance and functionality of our home.  Jason also gave us great advice on where there were opportunities to cut cost and where we should go with higher quality materials. 

We highly recommend Jason for any consolation project. He and his team are professional, reliable, honest and extremely talented (and he is a pretty good pool player too).  Check out his website to see pictures of his quality work."

I've also used them for installing new outdoor security cameras, which all required electrical connections. I relied on their expertise and they made great recommendations for both the selection of the cameras and the best viewing places around my house.  I am so pleased to know I have a local company that I can trust with all my electrical needs."

Then I had a problem with my filter and I didn't know how to fix it.  Contacted Dax and he had my pool up and running in a few days.  Have used Blue Knight ever since and it has been Great!
Home Services,2.0,OR,"When this was called Stonybrook, the management company was bad yet at least the management company's name was visible. Since bought by the new management company, their website does not even mention what the name of the company is. They changed their name, seemingly to hide from Stonybrook's horrible reviews. 
Since bought by the new management company, I have not received a water bill, but am encouraged to pay last month's amount for water with the rent. The rent does not change but the water should. I have not received a bill for water in three months, but have been repeating previous bills by request of the office."

I had a really bad experience with another local moving company when I first arrived, so I was nervous about True Friends, but they exceeded my expectations. They were efficient and friendly. Ron and Jerry did a great job with everything and finished the job of moving my many, many boxes within a reasonable time frame. I am in a short term rental while I look for a house in the area, and I will definitely hire True Friends again because Ron and Jerry were excellent."

However after a week, I noticed the unit (which is outside the house) is making a lot of noise, and wobbling a lot & noticed there was Radiator damage. I complained, and a new technician came over. He said, this is the best we can do, and if the AC is working you are fine. The faulty workmanship is something you should ignore and move on :(
One more unsatisfied customer !!"

Josh, Rob and Austin were absolutely amazing! They were in and out in just under 3 hours. I couldn't believe the care they took on our items,  even wrapped all the big stuff. Talk about 5 star treatment. They will be storing our things until our home is done then they'll be delivering to us.

By far, 6th man movers provide the best moving experience. I have used them three times now. They show up on time. They are considerate and careful in avoiding any damage. They are good-natured and hardworking. Thankfully, they do not so silly things like smoking on the clock. I have been impressed with their professionalism. The manager always calls to follow up and to assure a good experience and to reconcile any issues with the move."

We called Black Tie to discuss this and they said simply that the movers were running late, nothing further, just that they were running late. They finally arrived at noon (an hour late!) which was too late because we had booked a freight elevator at our new residence at that exact time. Needless to say this is extremely unprofessional and do not use this service if you want a good professional moving company."
Home Services,1.0,OR,Horrible customer service.  They don't complete all agreed to services - they charged me full price and treated half my property all season long.  Asked the guys who actually came to the house why - they told me they were only to do the front.  NEVER agreed to that especially at $68 / visit.  Was constantly promised someone would get back to me about the service and restitution...no one ever called.  I do not recommend this company to anyone and will tell everyone I know about their bad business practices and service.  If zero stars would register - then i would have selected that.

Beach could not get closer and the place could not be more beachy.  Loved the free bikes to take whenever you want and the room was clean, smelled nice, and made me feel at home. Great staff.  I came from the other side of the state to get a weekend on the gulf side, for a lil stay vacation,  and I will be staying there again and again for more. Cute studio apartment I highly recommend"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Stayed here in a single room for one night. The hotel manager was very nice and welcoming. The room was very clean. The housekeeper left only one set of towels, so had to sort that out. And no fruit, which I think was supposed to have been left in the room. But the room and bed, plus TV and accommodations were so clean and nice that it was refreshing to stay here. Don't take a room near the pool, since teens like to hang out there in the evening and talk all night. Overall, the room was very nice and much better than our room the night before in SLO."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"On March 29th I had EZ Brothers meet me at the Pods location in Hudson, move the contents of my two containers into their trucks and move me to Fort Myers. Quick and easy. They were very efficient, very friendly and very careful! In fact, one of the legs of my wife's bedroom dresser buckled while in the POD. Chris Conner had tools with him and he was able to insert a screw and fix it for us. He and the rest of his crew (Jonathon Remy, Gee Simeon and David Allen) did an amazing job. I thoroughly recommend EZ Brothers for any and all moving needs."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Had an amazing experience working with Haley. She listened to everything I really wanted, the location, the budget, the bedroom space, even the balcony I really wanted :) and somehow made it all happen within a matter of hours. I only was able to come to Nashville for one day and she found several apartments that fit my needs. She scheduled the tours that day and went with us to tour them. Haley did a great job and was so hands on. She even asked the good questions at each leasing office that are important for me to know. I highly recommend Haley to anyone trying to find an apartment!!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Arthur Perez recently moved me for the third time over the course of 25 years, each time as professional as the next.  When I decided to move to an apartment this year, I was so delighted to learn that they were still doing business in New Orleans.  A well seasoned 4-man crew showed up on time -- they were polite, well-mannered, patient, efficient, and professional.  They actually came in under the estimated time, saving me $$.  They take credit cards as well as cash or check and you pay when the job is finished.  They are the only movers I have or will ever use."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Branden at Ace is a true pro in every sense of the term.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I ordered a home cleaning for my mother as a Mother's Day gift for Saturday, May 11. She received a text message from Antoine the Thursday prior asking for her address, details of the cleaning, etc and she was confirmed for Saturday at 2pm. She then received another text Saturday morning confirming her appointment for 2pm. 

It is now 5:30pm and the cleaners never showed. We were unable to reach them via text and phone calls were sent to voicemail. This is the most unprofessional experience I have ever encountered, and will never use them again and would not recommend them to anyone."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Do not buy from this place.  They do not honor their guarantees.  Their customer service, installers, and material is very poor.  Strips on carpet not placed properly and door stops not replaced after installation.  Carpeting wearing after 2 years.   Their laminate is coming up and they refuse to replace it because we used Swiffer Wetjet to clean it.  We were never told not to use it on the laminate or what we should be using to clean it.  I feel they are still responsible because we were not informed of how to take care of the laminate.  Just overall a distrustful company."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I wouldn't recommend this company for any type of HVAC or sheet metal work.  Used to be good, but lately have resorted to overcharging for services.  I had been a maintenance agreement customer until I was charged for a visit that was 1 week after my unit had been serviced.  There are many other HVAC companies out there that would not have charged for this visit.  I also had a situation where I was charged for two separate visits when any other shop would have completed the work properly the first time.  Apparently they only want big jobs and don't seem to care about the customer."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"5+ stars all the way. Response time was immaculate. I put in a request at night (late night) thinking they would get back to me the next morning, but received a response the same night. Spoke to a guy named Kit in the morning for scheduling and he was able to get me in right at opening!

Everything was done extremely with precision and I loved the finished product. I was in and out within a few hours. I enjoyed watching him do his work. It seemed like he really takes pride. Price is reasonable too. I will make sure to recommend this place and always come here from now on out."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"The gentlemen that moved us to our first home were absolutely amazing. They made the experience so smooth and seamless. They are very experienced and work very quickly. The quality of their work was great too. They made sure to wrap delicate furniture, the walls were untouched which is amazing trying to get big furniture up the stairs. They arrived at the our first location (in Sarasota/Bradenton area) early and ready to go. To top off their great work, they had a great attitude! 

Very very pleased with them and I would absolutely recommend for anyone looking for movers. I am definitely coming back as a loyal customer for future moves."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I used this company for a long distance move. If you think you will empty the pod right away, they might be fine to deal with. 
If you depend on them to deliver the pod after a few months or a year, good luck. They are fairly unreliable for delivery currently. Some of it could be the labor market in 2021. 
I called to schedule delivery in late November and their first available delivery date was December 8th. The 8th came and went and they no-showed. It caused me to cancel movers. I had to scramble to find movers with short notice..and that was IF they showed up the next day."

We saw so many houses and my husband and I had a hard time finding 'the house'. Nicole kept assuring us that we would find it, and she was absolutely correct.
She is smart, patient, and fun! We instantly felt comfortable with her and I almost want to house hunt again just so I can keep working with her!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,This is the worst apartment building. I currently live here in a 2x2 apartment and it is a SCAM. Ive had termites and a flood in my apartment in less then the 6 months of me living here. The apartments are horrible quality. The staff is rude. It looks nice from the outside and it looks like they have all these great amenities. But in reality half of their stuff is broken and doesn't get fixed. Their pool is dirty and really never gets cleaned. Their maintenance goes into your apartment without permission or you even being there. Horrible apartment even for the price. Pay a little more and go somewhere else.
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Outstanding quality work and excellent customer service.  Blake refinished our 1934 floors and installed hardwood over concrete in two rooms a year ago.  After about 9 months one of the floors over concrete came undone, started to raise up and created a large bump in the room.  Michael Blake came out, looked it over, investigated and found out the the problem was with the glue used.  It was not Blake's faults, as the glue vendor reported having the same problem in their showroom.  This company does outstanding work, stands behind their installations and does beautiful refinishing and installations.  Trust in them, a relative rarity these days."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Whoever the moron was that made the decision to start work at 5:45pm on a weekday, on a main thoroughfare, and close that road, should be fired on the spot. What the HELL would possess someone to block off Springfield Road (one of the most heavily traveled roads in Delaware County) at the peak of ""rush hour"" and send hundreds of cars FLYING down into neighborhoods and small backstreets? This was literally a nightmare for residents who could not get in or out of their homes, for over an hour and had to watch people squeeze past each other on narrow streets, avoiding parked cars by millimeters. Dumbest decision I've ever witnessed."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. They promise a better quality of renters, but during the 10 plus years I was with their company I never experienced this. When I chose not raise my rent on my property, West End Management dropped me from their services and proceeded to tell me that the costly damages to my property were my fault because of my rent amount. They never did inspections on my property and allowed the tenant to change the locks without my consent. Then never told me until the tenant moved out and I wanted to see the property and they did not have a key to the house."
Home Services,1.5,OR,This company needs to learn about real estate and that time is of the essence in a contract and learn to become responsive.     My management company had been doing their own docs for 50 years and all ran very smoothly and then they hired Homewisedocs in July and we have had continual delays in closing escrows.     This is causing Buyer's to lose loan locks and seller's delayed in the closing on the next property....not only are all parties in a transaction very frustrated but we have escrow officers and lenders involved.      Something needs to be done about this company!!!!
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Worst move ever. They are just a broker and no oversight or management. Gave me a bid then moved it up $2000 three days before I had to be out for house closing. Had me against a wall so paid it. Then packers showed up hours late for packing (7 pm start and left almost midnight) Then delivery was for only a third of my belongings. 11 days later ""found"" and delivered supposedly the rest. But lost a lot and damaged more including a TV, a blackened, twisted mattress, lamps, rugs...list goes on and on. This gets no stars at all but had to put one. Save yourself and don't use them!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Unprofessional and expensive. 
Jarrod stated he would arrive at my home at 5pm to provide a quote for the move.  I had to call him to see if he was going to still make it and he finally arrived at 6pm.  He has a 3-hour minimum and the clock starts when they leave their business and ends when they return to their shop.  This means you are paying for 30 or so minutes for their commute time.  The attitude was not so friendly either.  I suggest reaching out to other well-rated movers.  We did and we got a much better price and with a friendly attitude."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Highly recommended! Great communication, workmanship and a fair price. We had a leaky sink drain pipe in the crawl space and Jack arrived when he said he would, provided a clear explanation of the issue and provided two options to fix it. As the faulty pipe was behind a wall, Jack recommended abandoning the old pipe and running a new pipe as opposed to a more expensive fix that involved removing part of the wall. His ""workaround"" was up to code and I verified a dry crawl space and evidence of his quality workmanship a month later when in the crawl space for another reason. Low stress experience and high quality work!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Similar experience to most other reviews. I got assigned this company through my American Home Shield (AHS)warranty when I was having HVAC issues. Jason showed up and diagnosed the problem within five minutes. The next day I got a quote for 1,200 worth of repairs not covered by my warranty and would need to come back in a week. 

I called someone else out who spent three hours trouble shooting my issue, came the day after I called him, diagnosed it as a completely different issue, and charged me only 135.00 as he walked me through each step as he was trouble shooting. I called back AHS to cancel my follow-up visit."
Home Services,3.0,CG,"Got to say this review is an absolute joke.  I will admit that my apartment was pretty damn nice before we moved in.  There were some things we didn't like, but that's part of the fun of living in a rental property.  This is a rental property, and I don't think I've ever been disappointed by the apartments I've rented out.  They are awesome.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"DO NOT RENT AT ELLISTON 23

I know what you're thinking -- it's close to Vanderbilt's campus and tons of other students rent there, so it can't be too bad, right?

Wrong. Elliston 23 and The Connor Group will do everything in their power to take all the money they can, and then some. They blatantly violate TN law, and when you call them out on it, they'll come after you anyway. 

Legal issues aside, this is no way to treat your renters. Elliston 23 and The Connor Group lack any shred of human decency -- they only exist to suck students who don't know any better dry in order to fuel their own greed."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Geeks 2 You is now our IT department and they have done an excellent job over the past 4 months. They are smart, pleasant to deal with, affordable and have an honest can do/will do attitude. Our company had gone through five IT managers and personnel over the past four years and we were reluctant to try an IT service provider. So far it's been one of the best moves we've made, operationally, and we are much better supported than in my previous four years. Geeks 2 You delivers an exceptional value for an extremely affordable price, as well as being an amazingly responsive and experienced company."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"If it was up to me, id give them --5 stars. hsl is quick to take rent money, but they arent quick to render services that they provide. They are quick to hand notices and evict, but cant hire good and friendly staff. (office and maintance) after they receive  it, they ghost you until next month when money is due. HSL i dont (i do) understand, how you guys get so many negative reviews, but.you guys dont do anything to fix th problems. All you guys say is, go to the office so we can discuss it? You guys arent fixing the problems. You guys need to start listening to your rents."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I needed a new heating system for my house and got three different, of the three this company I felt the most comfortable with.  Everyone on their staff was extremely polite and didn't rush me at any parts of the process.  The sales man tried to find the system that worked best for me, and did not pressure me into getting the most expensive system. The technicians were extremely knowledgeable, showing me what everything did and how it worked. Even though I went with the most baseline system, they still used high quietly parts and fittings.   I am completely happy with my system and love how it turned out."
Home Services,5.0,OR,Wow is all this review needs. I will go into more detail though. First let's start with how quickly they got me an appointment at a time that worked for me. Great customer service. You get what you pay for is a great saying. Sure you can go to some bootleg place and get it done for $99 but from my experience the quality was horrible. These guys busted out an amazing job in a little under a hour. Such a clean look. They have a sweet waiting room with nice couches and a tv. I'd highly recommend them if you are looking to get your windows tinted. Thanks for the great job!
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Absolutely the worst financial institution EVER! They are unorganized and unfriendly. I was the victim of fraud and these clowns act like I did it all myself! They are all idiots. .Never have I experienced such incompetent employees. No one explains anything to you because they don't know themselves. And never have I had to deal with rude unfriendly employees both on the phone and in person. 
.I filed a complaint against them with the Federal Reserve for not informing me of the fraud process, for not providing me with information on fraud, for lack of communication, ,for saying one thing and doing another. How they are still in business is beyond me."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Wow, what a terrific idea. The vet comes to you. Got a cat that won't go in a carry box? Pet too sick to take in the car? This vet (and her assistant) come to you with just about the same stuff you get at the vet office. I didn't see an x-ray machine in the back of the SUV but who knows? :D 

Dr. Lori was very professional, very complimentary about both our home and our dog (neither of which is showroom quality) and she and her assistant were very comfortable handling our squiggly Jack Russell. They made us feel very comfortable.

Surprisingly, rates are not that expensive considering it's a house call."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I had a contract with Bill Hallston of Easy Bath Solutions to remodel my master bath.The shower enclosure & backsplash was fine.The floor has been a different story. He laid Congoleum tiles and the spaces between the tiles were wide. So he filled the spaces with caulk. During the initial cleaning of the floor , a great deal of the caulk came out.I have been trying since November of 2016 to have him correct his workmanship but to no avail.He made arrangements to come out twice but never showed up or called to say he couldn't make it.He says he guaranties his work but getting him to return  has been a nighmare."

If you are a professional, or student, or any adult who needs to sleep at a reasonable hour for work, this is not the place for you.

 And the fancy gym downstairs? More than half of the equipment does not work and is crap.

Home Services,2.0,CG,Do NOT live here! I had an emergency emergency and they did nothing. When I called to say they were doing an emergency they said they were going to come out to check it out and that it was a no show. I called again and told them I had to call them again. They said they could come out and check it out but the emergency call was so bad I could not do anything. I called again and asked if they could come out to check out the issue and they said no they just wanted to leave a message.
Home Services,4.5,CG,"This review is too far and will be leaving it in the cold.

The person who came to my home had a bad attitude. He then said he didn't have enough time to go through my home and that I needed to call him.

There is also a pool on the side of the building.  The two restaurants are all close to each other.  The office is open about 1-2 hours a day, which is great,"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I had US Inspect stop by to look at a home I am to purchase. They sent David Weikel. I was nervous about the whole process, and he was awesome to work with. He suggested that I follow him around and ask any questions that I might have. Even when I didn't, he made sure that I had a full understanding of everything in the house, how it worked, and what this would mean for me as the homebuyer (and a first-time homebuyer at that). He took his time, and was able to write up an extremely detailed report before the evening was over. I couldn't recommend him (and vicariously the company) more thoroughly."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I would have given them  a 0 but that is not possible. I scheduled movers to arrive at 9am at 9.15 am no one had showed up.  I called the company and was informed that one of my movers had called out and they were looking for a replacement. They offered me a discount for the wait and would call back as soon as they found someone. Apparently they never fever found someone because after calling them back twice nobody answered the phone, responded to my voice mails or showed up for my move, which is the worsed thing you can do to someone moving on Saturday needing to find new movers."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Bill came over after my outside lock stopped working- the key went in and turned, but wouldn't un-lock.   It wasn't an emergency so he came a couple days later, when he said, and on time.  I was so embarrassed when it worked!  He explained what happened- it was really hot, and suggested I hose it down if it happens again when it's really hot an humid, and that would contract the metal a bit. And when I asked how much, because he did fulfill his obligation by coming, he said ""no charge"".  He was so nice.  I put his number in my phone in case I need him!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We hired Sparkly Cleaning based off of Yelp reviews and were extremely pleased from booking to cleaning! Fast, honest, thorough and efficient communication on the front end was highly appreciated during the booking process. 

On the morning of the cleaning, the staff was extremely friendly and trustworthy. I felt comfortable leaving them in my home while I left for work with my pup still at the house. They were even nice enough to let him out of his crate before they left so that he wouldn't have to stay cooped up for too long. When I got home I loved finding a truly clean and sparkly apartment! I will definitely be booking again soon!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"When we moved into our new house, the backyard needed a lot of work. Our neighbors used Amazing Scapes for their backyard renovation and we knew we needed to give them a call. Felicia came out a few times going over the scope of our project and answering any questions we had. They were able to fit us in super early. The team got here early in the day and spent all day working on what turned into a flawless patio area. Amazing Scapes is a professional, quick (without compromising quality), locally owned family biz that's worth calling. They're our go-to for landscaping now and we will be telling all our friends and family."

No one offered help. We approched the desk and asked for design help. We looked through different products. Samples were small, no person really had answer to questions, lack options. Oh my goodness. i could go on and on. Forget this place. Go to floor and decor. Go to The Tile Shop. Go to Tile Gallerie. go."

They were late with the installation and found out after that they had broke the granite and glued it back together, hoping we would not notice!  We found 2 areas broken.  One, across the sink area from front to back and another on a corner, which immediately broke off when leaned on.
Khalid promised to replace the granite, but to this day has still not released the slabs to us and has not worked with our contractor to get the job finished.  Beware- he will make many promises, but uses the bait and switch method very easily!  Do not trust him!"

They left without finishing, as they didn't install the 2 gates. It's now 7/22 and we still have two gaping holes in the fence where the gates should be and have not heard from anyone!! Terrible!!

Home Services,3.5,OR,"The door they installed is good quality - it was pricey and took over the two months originally quoted even with a very early design change.  However, I asked for a re-key before I signed the contract and paid half the amount, and they didn't include it in the price.  Despite spending thousands on the door, they refused to honor a small re-key fee.  Their lack of customer service on this issue and repeated comments on how they didn't care about any referrals I would've sent their way really shows the true character of this company.  Watch out for bad customer service and refusal to acknowledge any issues on their end."

The extra facilities (pool, gym, theatre room, etc) are a great plus and always looked after. The building entrances are well lit and secured. The snow and ice is looked after in a timely manner in both the parking lots and the sidewalks. My building manager Lucia is very responsive to requests, is very prompt and organized and is always very friendly and greets me with a smile. I have had no issues in dealing with her about anything at all. I would recommend to rent Midwest!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,If you need to move you need to call these guys! They probably have the best prices in town and they are very professional and courteous. Corey got everything set up for my move and kept in contact with me so that everything would go off without a hitch. Josh and KJ showed up on time and got to work immediately. They moved everything out of my house (including a piano) andand were on their way to our new place in 38 minutes! And they are very personable to boot! Very impressed! Hopefully I won't have to move again anytime soon but if I do I will definitely be calling these guys.
Home Services,5.0,OR,You'll be happy you found Joe and Tree Guys! I found them on Yelp and I am grateful for all the reviews so here's my personal experience. Joe met with me in the pouring rain to look at 8 different trees. His quote was reasonable and less than competing bids from other companies. His work was exceptional. Everything was done as promised and as expected. He was very considerate of our neighbors. He had to reschedule several times due to weather conditions and always communicated with me to keep me posted. The sites were cleared and restored after his work. I'd use him again in a heartbeat. Great guy. Great work. Great company.
Home Services,3.0,OR,I've enjoyed getting back to some normalcy and finally shopping for my move. The office person was really helpful actually a number of people made me feel welcome. I saw two apartments today a model and a empty apartment. I've seen the Gardens of Canal when on the trail and wanted to check them out for awhile. First I had a video tour sent to me and I really like seeing first hand that the video was accurate. Pleased that the office was open today and I was invited  and was impressed with the stainless steel appliances (I think they were new) and  modern finishes- chrome . I'm making the commitment today. .
Home Services,1.0,OR,"This company is a joke. Worst product and support I have ever experienced. On-going problems with our services and account for months on end. Their customer service, which they outsource to Asia, is clueless, aloof and inept. How government allowed the sale of Verizon's network to this rinky dink operation, I'll never understand. They clearly aren't capable of operating it. For business solutions in Saint Petersburg, I only hope Google will enter our market with fiber soon as is rumored. I have zero confidence in Frontier's ability to seevice our market reliably. At least their company is aptly named - they sure make you feel like you're roughing it out on the frontier. Horrible experience."
Home Services,2.0,CG,"I read positive reviews of this place and thought it would be a good place to stay.  The owner, B.B.C., took pride in his customer service and his workmanship.  We were happy to have a manager who can deal with our complex issues.  The residents were extremely friendly and very friendly.  We would definitely use them again.I've had great experiences with my apartment complex and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable apartment complex.

Home Services,5.0,CG,"I never knew how much time it took to finish a job.  When I got home, I noticed that the flooring had a ""tint"" stain on the outside, and that it was extremely hard to get it out.  I asked if I could get it cleaned, and they said they could come out the next day.  I called on Monday and they said they could come out the next day.  I called on Wednesday and they said they could come out the next day.  I called on Thursday and they said they could come out the next day."
Home Services,2.5,CG,"This is the worst building in the whole area. I will not recommend this building to anyone. I had an issue with the fence. The fence was not fixed. The guy that came to fix it said it was a bit too high. He said it would be $100 a piece. I said it would be $300 a piece. He said it would be $60 a piece. I said that was too high and that I would not have to pay for the fence. I said no, I will get another fence."
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Impeccable service, highly recommended.

Wanted to go back and forth with him for a few months, but I just wanted to make sure the phone calls were answered and the work was done.  I was so pleased with the service and the cost I paid for it.I had to call two times for the install.  First was to the office, which was over the phone with a sales rep.  I was told there was no problem with it and they were doing it right away.  The second time was to the house where the installers"

They are awesome.  I have tried to contact them on numerous occasions over the past two years, and have received no response.  I have been contacted multiple times, and they haven't responded to"
Home Services,4.0,CG,"Good local rental yard with a great selection of materials. I will definitely be using them again!Great job! Great crew! I am a HOA member and have had great experiences with this company. First, they came out for a service call to find out what the problem was. They came out and showed me the problem and gave me a price. They did a great job!  I was happy to go with them!

Second, they showed up to my house on time, were polite, and did a great job."

Home Services,5.0,CG,"We had Bent Nail conduct a number of inspections and decided to hire a professional to do the cleaning. We had an excellent experience with our installer and his crew. We would definitely recommend Bent Nail to anyone in the area.Our AC came out yesterday. I called to find out what the problem was. I was told the problem was a ""plumbing issue"". I was told the plumbing problem was caused by the leak from the ceiling fan.  I called a tech and he said that it was a ""plumbing issue"" because he had no idea what it was."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Excellent Service. I am a very satisfied customer. I had hired Ricks Construction Services to do a facelift on my carpeted stairs that were in dire need of repair. Rick removed all of the carpet and carpet tacks. He repaired all the holes and cracks along the stairs. He did a fantastic job sanding and priming. The stairs look fantastic after it was done. After The final coat of paint was applied, he installed some stair treads. I would definitely use Rick again in the future for any work that I need done. I didn't feel like I was gouged on the price like with some other guys would charge. I highly recommend ricks construction services."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"What an amazing job. I am not quite sure why they have received such low reviews as the service they provided was superb. I wake up at 4 am everyday and to my surprise they answered to confirm an appointment with me that day. However, I wasn't available so I opted in for today. Immediately after confirming my appointment, they requested pictures to assist with servicing my shower. They also texted me when in route to my home. They were extremely pleasant, quick, knowledgeable, and made several recommendations. Overall, they deserve much higher ratings because their service stood out above the rest and trust me I called many companies to fix my issue in the area."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"We used Move Crew in August.  They seemed like a good alternative with fair pricing. Not a good choice. Arrived 4 hours late with a variety of excuses, without professional moving equipment, truck was too small even after they walked through our home 2x before the move. Move ran past 10pm, with no time for putting beds together, which was part of the deal. Some minor damage. We paid the full price and tipped the guys (they were very nice and hard-working)We requested and were promised (in writing) our deposit back and we have not received it. Owners have not responded to our emails, calls, or texts. In the end, very unprofessional and a disappointment."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"It's a low grade Residence Inn

So this one of the worst RIs in which we've stayed...and we stay in a lot of RIs because of the availability of 2BRs. That said it wasn't bad...just OK. If we had to stay in the immediate area and needed a 2BR I would stay here again without a qualm. But if I just wanted to stay 'near Philly' I would choose a different RI.

From our what it's worth COVID department, they did not provide coffee packs in the rooms. And 'breakfast' was coffee - regular or dark, no decaf - and packaged banana nut muffins. Again, not up to the standards other RIs have managed to maintain during COVID."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"BEWARE!! Grossly incompetent and negligent. Due to misdiagnosis of problem significant damages were sustained. The owner of the company got extremely hostile with me when I began to question the work done and losses incurred. Unethical. Didn't honor 100% Money Back Guarantee which designates money back if dissatisfied with work or problem was not resolved. Losses sustained were in the thousands, problem was not resolved, and no reimbursement of the $600 paid for services. I was able to find someone else to solve the problem in a timely and much less expensive way. Don't take your chances with this business. There are many better alternative exterminators out there to choose from who take their work seriously."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"This is my family 2nd year living here and I soooo regret ever signing a second lease!! We got transfered to an updated unit so I thought things would be better. We moved in May 9 2021 and We still do not have mail keys . Everytime I call its excuse after excuse and no one can ever even tell me if they have been ordered!!! Or they say ""the post office is backed up and we havent recieved alot of key"" which is definetly a LIE!! I called the post office and they said they are not back up from may !! So that means my keys HAVE NOT BEEN ORDERED!! just a joke !!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"As with everyone else, they came out to rune a 49.00 dollar diagnostic test on my water heater.  They guy did not even check my pilot light. He placed his hand on the blower and said its warm its shot. Then went on to tell me I need a new water just on the fact that it was old. I told him but it is working. He said yes but COULD go out in three years so I should spend five grand to fix it.  He was clueless about the water I had. Again my story is similar to everyone else's on here. What a useless company. I will report to BBB in am."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"hands down the WORST customer service i've ever dealt with. bought a livingsocial coupon and they refused to clean my carpets with the coupon because they were ""too dirty"" - except the carpet was brand-new one year ago, and we hardly ever wear shoes in the living room. so he just didn't want to clean the carpets because he's lazy and incompetent. his immediate comment to me was ""get your money back or pay an additional $60 for me to clean the carpet' bahahaha. what a joke! i've never written a poor review, because I feel like customers should make decisions based on their own experiences, however I couldn't help but post this....RUN FOR THE HILLS!"

Home Services,4.0,CG,"One star rating due to the fact that the materials are very smooth and the workmanship is top notch. I had a lot of headaches with the workmanship, so I decided to give it a shot. I found a local cleaning company that is very professional and gives you the best price. They have a great team and are very thorough and thorough with the job. They are very professional, very pleasant to deal with and they do a great job. I will definitely use them again. I'm going to leave a review because they were awful."
Home Services,3.5,CG,I made an online appointment and it was an appointment. I emailed back and asked for a quote. I called the company and they said they would get back to me within a day. The next day I received a call saying I would have to call again and again to get a quote. I called back and was told the phone number I had to call was disconnected and they had already canceled my appointment. I called and they said it was on hold. I called again and got a call back saying I would be charged $250.00 for the service and it was not canceled.
Home Services,5.0,CG,Called and explained my emergency and asked if they could come out and replace my furnace. I said no.  They had to replace the furnace and then the next day the furnace was going to go out.  It was fixed in a matter of days.  After some waiting they came out and gave me a quote.  I called them and told them they would call me back later.  They did.  I called them and asked if they could come out to replace the furnace and they said no.  I called back and was told they would call me back tomorrow.

Home Services,2.5,CG,It is validating to read that the professional and knowledgeable folks at the office are very hard working and thorough. I had a friend who was also in the office who had a very large family with many pets and she was very understanding of the situation. This is a very good thing. They are very experienced and the office staff is very helpful and professional. I really appreciate that I was able to get ahold of them and they did a great job. I will definitely use them again. I'm going to leave a review because they were awful.
Home Services,1.5,CG,"The staff here is incredible. We have had an awful experience with them. When I moved in, we had two employees that worked for a company that is running out of money. I had to go to another company and get a refund. The one I dealt with was the one that was the best. The place was clean and it was a great place to live. I've had great experiences with my friends and family and they are all extremely nice and friendly.

Home Services,3.5,CG,"My wife and I met with an electrician and a plumber. Both were very friendly and thorough.  The plumber explained the process and then provided a quote. The plumber was very professional and detailed.  The electrician came out the next day to check on the work and was very professional.  He explained the process and explained how the work would be done.  He was very professional and very pleasant to work with.  The electrician was very professional and very attentive to his clients.  The plumber was very knowledgeable, professional and pleasant to work with."
Home Services,2.0,CG,"This plumber is a scam. We have had an AC unit for about a year now and have not had a problem. The technician, Eric, is the most honest person I have ever met. He is friendly and professional. I would highly recommend them. I will be using them again. I have used this company for the past 3 years and have never had a problem. I have been a customer for almost 5 years now and am extremely happy with the service. I have had no issues with any of the maintenance guys, they are friendly, professional and professional."
Home Services,5.0,OR,I had a leak in a PVC pipe in a new house I just purchased. I didn't know any plumbers in Philly so I did a Yelp search for plumbers. I read the reviews and requested a quote from Philadelphia Plumbing Services. I received an immediate response from Mary and was able to schedule the service two days later (this was not an emergency). Julio and his teammate were excellent. They explained everything to me thoroughly and worked very efficiently. They also left the workspace very clean. I felt the price was very fair and reasonable and appreciate the email invoice and on-line transaction. I will call Philadelphia Plumbing Services for any future plumbing issues. Very impressed.
Home Services,2.0,OR,DON'T MOVE HERE!!!!! It was all good until MCM Management took over. They got rid of the maintenance staff on site and now nothing gets fixed. How do you run an apartment complex and dont have maintenance on site? They continuously lie about sending maintenance out to fix your problems and they tell you that they paged them but dont know why they didnt show up. I've been waiting for over a month for my heat to be fixed and they have the nerve to overcharge me this month. Save yourself the trouble and stress and look somewhere else. I've spoken to other tenants that live here and they all do not plan on renewing their lease.
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Jim was great to work with from the start. After multiple calls to many landscaping companies for quotes, Jim was one of the few that came through and was the most reasonably priced. He worked with us to bring the cost down to where my wife and I were comfortable. The work was phase 1 of 3 for our curb appeal project! The work was very labor intensive, and they got it done in 3 days. Proper irrigation (sprinklers attached to hoses) was critical to this establishment and totally worth the extra cost to do it right. Our neighbors have made many positive comments to use about our yard. Do not hesitate to hire Second Nature Landscaping!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Our newly purchased home needed some glass in a window replaced. Also, several windows had water spots that we couldn't remove. The technician referred us to a product to remove  the hard water  Also, when he saw that  the window that was removable, he suggested bringing it into the shop to save money. It took a little while for the glass to come in, but we dropped the window off, had lunch and Bam, it was done! All for a much lower price than any other company quoted us. The product to remove the hard water was frickin' amazing!!!! Lots of elbow grease, but we're so happy to have a clear view."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"These guys are top-rated for a reason. Emailed at 1030pm, got a reply from Garrett at 615am the following morning. Got my quote and it was lower than other 5-Star places I reached out to. Both Garret and Vinnie were a pleasure to deal with. They tinted 2 brand new cars for my wife & I and we couldn't be happier with the work they did. These guys are awesome. I'm looking forward for these guys to put the protective film on both our cars because unfortunately, we had ours done through the dealership and it was subpar work. Keep up the great work, Garrett & Vinnie. I will definitely recommend you guys to friends and family"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Hey,  I'm planning on moving my family to Woodberry Woods Apts.  All of these reviews are worrying me because I have a 5 year old son, Hunter, and he has some beautiful extra special needs .  He can't live in a mold or AC problems because of his chronic lung disease.   But the layout of the 3-bedroom floor plan is perfect. I have 3 children.  Sara is 9, Hunter is 5 and Jeremy 2 years old. What are your honest opinions for a mom who needs help with finding a 3-bedroom apt that accepts vouchers... Thank you and God Bless You All! Have a very merry Christmas and happy new years!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"BEWARE! This was an absolutely terrible job. We paid $850 for what was supposed to be a privacy screen. As you can see in the photo, the material is completely transparent and the wood beams are unfinished and unstained. They are cheap materials, it was only 2.5 hours of labor, and the goal of the project was not accomplished. We were willing to work with Jim and we called to see if we could come up with a solution together. He was rude and refused to help any further. His customer service is awful and he was aggressive and argumentative about our dissatisfaction with the job. The photo clearly shows that the project is unfinished and unacceptable."
Home Services,3.0,OR,I had Matt come to my house and give me his idea about remodeling my kitchen and my bathroom vanities. The appointment went well I thought we had a good plan and he was going to get back in touch with me. We made an appointment but unfortunately my dog came down with valley fever and was very sick and I had to get her to the vet emergently so I had to cancel that appointment. Ever since then I can't get Matt to call me back I've even gone to the show room and asked to see Matt and ask that Matt give me a call but for whatever reason Matt has chosen not call me.
Home Services,3.0,OR,"This has been my bank for many years. I'm judging it by today's experience at this location. There were only 2 tellers, and both were conducting lengthy complex transactions with customers. THEY TOOK TOO LONG. I waited and waited and waited. Over 20 minutes. I should have been in and out of there in 3 minutes. The host/greeter guy was doing nothing, just standing around; he could have called for more tellers, or manned a window himself, I'm sure he had the authority. An unexceptable level of slowness. Long transactions should be handled by someone else in the bank. Or there ought to be a ""speedy checkout"" window, just for cashing checks and making deposits."
Home Services,4.5,CG,I moved to Nashville from Tampa. The guys at Reno Roofing did an excellent job!  They came out on time and did a great job.  They even took a picture of the roof and had it covered in paint so it looked better.  I highly recommend Reno Roofing!I was looking for a quick and easy way to get my water heater running without damaging my vehicle.

The inspector came and told me the problem was a leak from the fence.  He stated the problem was with the fence.  I called the inspector and he said he did not have the report.

They were scheduled to arrive on time and the day of the appointment was no later than 10:30. They were a bit late with the appointment and I was told that the office would call back within the next couple of days. When I called the office to confirm that they were at the property within a week, they were told that they would be at the property within a week."
Home Services,1.0,CG,I knew I was in a bind and needed to make a decision. I called the local branch. They said they had a technician out. He said he would call me back and get back to me within an hour. I called back and he told me he had to call me back. I was confused as to why I was being charged the $150 fee. I called him back and he said he had to call me back and tell me he was sorry. I asked for a refund and he said he would send me a copy of the technician's bill. I was just so appalled
Home Services,4.5,CG,"I had a stellar experience with this company.  We've had a lot of problems with them.  Their solution is to charge a higher rate for the service, which is very reasonable.  They are friendly and efficient.  We will use them again and will recommend them to everyone.I have used them for a few years and have had great customer service.  They have great customer service and great customer service.   I am very pleased with the prices they provide and will use them again in the future.I would give them 4 stars if I could.

Home Services,2.5,CG,"This is a review specifically for an AC system, which is a complex that is complex and expensive.

I had a technician come out and get the unit running. The AC technician was very professional and thorough. He explained how to do it. I appreciated his time and he was also very helpful.

I would highly recommend him and his crew to anyone looking to install a new heater.I had to start looking for a plumbing company after getting a call from a company that had just moved me from a previous home to a new one. I called one of the plumbers, he said he would call me back"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"This company came to my house yesterday and replaced my entire air system, to include my AC and furnace, and cleaned out my air ducts. I have been suffering from headaches for as long as I can remember now, and this morning is the first time I woke up feeling healthy and without a headache. They went above and beyond to make sure that all of my needs were met at a reasonable monthly payment. I look forward to better sleep and a healthier air quality from this point on. And I will definitely always call this company for any of my heat, air, or plumbing needs. I can't rate them high enough!! 10 stars from my family!!"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I have been here for several months and love it here! The staff, from management, rental office, maintenance and grounds are courteous, friendly, helpful and professional. The residents are all pretty quiet and pick up after their dogs.  It has been a wonderful experience so far even in trying times with the Covid crisis. The staff have sent several emails of virtual events, as well as giving encouragement and empathy where appropriate. The complex has a community lake with a walking path, a mini dog park, a playground and a pool overlooking the lake with a mountain background.  I would highly recommend this community to anyone looking for a home, not just a place to live."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I highly recommend BAS. We needed the house cleaned top-to-bottom, and Abdul came through right away. Very reasonably priced, and most importantly, did a fantastic job. There were a few small places that were missed--for example, someone in the kitchen didn't clean a few parts that we expected (e.g., the stovetop). This kind of oversight was minor though and 99% of the house was thoroughly cleaned. It's very rare to find a cleaning company that has attention to detail, but Abdul does. He cleaned the smallest things you wouldn't expect--a stain in a hidden spot by a door; a scuff on a baseboard. He is very, very good. Everyone was professional and I would definitely use them again."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I have been dealing with company for the past few years now.  They are the worst property management company I have ever dealt with.

For the most important of things, they don't call you (or email!).  For those of us on the road a lot for work, it's impossible for us to read standard mail.  I've been screwed by these guys numerous times because they try to reach me only by standard mail.  I've been away from home for two months at times.  How are you supposed to service those folks Victorian Property Management??

Get on with Technology folks!  Improve your service and you won't have so many people in conflict with you guys."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Can you believe it?  A warranty that really works!  After 10 years, our car's window coatings still look amazing....except the rear window started to get distorted around the rear defroster grid.  Robin stood by the product's warranty and replaced the coating without charge.  Even though it was installed in New Port Richey.  AMAZING???  We were floored.  Many times one gets a warranty and the company fails or leaves after a few years.  Robin's company has been around for a long time.  And she stands by the product she uses!  Shows good business sense and excellent customer service.  I'd like to give her more stars!  Ken S."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I would have had a better experience, by going to the homeless shelter and hiring a group of guys off the street. These ""professionals"" dumped my boxes in a pile- didn't read the clearly marked labels, broke my furniture, and I keep running into pictures of items from my old house that never made it to my new house. I should have requested to look in the truck before they left, but at the end of a very horrible day stressful day -- I just wanted them gone and off my property- they were so careless and disrespectful. I would have felt better by setting $1500 on fire and watching it burn, than giving it to this company."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"We had Hartman Glass install a glass shower enclosure in our remodeled master bathroom.  Our tiler was meticulous in laying out the tile so that the glass would line up with and sit right on the grout joints, and so the measurements for the glass had to be precise.  We chose the door hinge that attaches to the wall at the top and sits on the sill at the bottom.  The glass was a perfect match and fit into the tile shower enclosure perfectly, right on the grout lines.  There were no gaps anywhere, and the enclosure is beautiful.  Tom was very pleasant to work with and the installers were knowledgable and courteous."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"The Mark is Not a safe place at all. The garage has no security, hallway doors are open at all times. Anyone has access to this building. The elevators were disgusting. With this pandemic I would have expected some arrangement by the management team to keep up with the hallway floors and elevators been clean up constantly. The smell of garbage is strong when you walk through every hallway. I will not rate this place as a student luxury building. Where is management? If there is anyone working at all. 
With all the other places to live in Tucson. Please go somewhere else and I guarantee you will be better off. This place is not worth your money."
Home Services,4.5,OR,I just called for a quote on moving services to see if it would be cheaper to move with a Uhaul or hire someone. James answered and the customer service was unheard of. He could of easily taken my money but instead talked me thru my options with Uhaul and explained why it would be better financially for me to just hire movers in the area when we get there. He took time to explain things to me and answered all my questions. Very pleasant man. Didn't talk down to me because I'm a female which is awesome. If it was cheaper for me to use them to move across the state I would in a heart beat.
Home Services,2.5,CG,"Counting the months until my lease ended, the tenant never called me back, never got a call back.  I had to get a call back by the next morning to find out that the tenant was having problems with the heater.  The previous tenant had come to my house and was also having problems with the heater.  I called the manager and the manager told me that I needed to get my lease refunded and that I needed to go to the office to get a new unit.  I called back and left a message.

Home Services,5.0,CG,"James was a pleasure to work with and the workmanship was exceptional. Highly recommend!Very disappointed. We had an old dishwasher, a small refrigerator, and a new dishwasher. We had to take our dishwasher outside to get it repaired. This was our first time using this company and it's been a long time since we have had a dishwasher. We've had issues with the main breaker, but not the unit itself. The dishwasher came out when it was supposed to and was working fine. The next morning, we called to schedule an appointment with the maintenance."

I would recommend them for any landscaping needs.I have lived here for several years and have been very happy with the quality of service.  This time I chose to go with Calvary Home Management.

Home Services,4.0,CG,"CAUTION DO NOT USE MODERN FORCES!!We just moved in and had a very nice experience. We had an old dishwasher, a small refrigerator, and a new dishwasher. We had a great experience with Jason and his team. They are professional and friendly. They had the entire kitchen cleaned before we even got the phone call. They did a great job getting everything set up. They were professional, courteous, and extremely helpful.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"First, the owner, Anthony, was extremely responsive and gave me a bid immediately based on the size of A garage. When I called him back he increased the bid based on the larger size garage I gave him. I asked to see his work, I met him at a Commercial building where his company epoxied two offices. They were striking. I received another bid where the company rep said would complete the job in one day and would guarantee their work. Anthony also guaranteed his work for life. The price was a lot more for the other company.
Anthony completed my job today. It is out standing, too beautiful to be a garage floor. I highly recommend Nevada Custom Coating."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"We have used Tri-Care Services since 2015 and I can't imagine having a different plumber or service. Kelly and they office team are professional, accommodating, and communicate well! Prices/fees are clearly explained. Each plumber has been timely, professional, and always completed the job. We had some laundry room repairs during a remodel that needed rapid response to prevent the remodel from slowing and they came same day! In our new home the dishwasher leaked everywhere on the first night of our move in. They arrived the next morning 830 am. With other services like the water softener, we set a mutually agreed time/date and as in all instances 2015-2021 on time and on budget. We highly recommend Tri-Care Services."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"It was over 100 outside and my air conditioner went out. Of course it had to be a weekend, Saturday afternoon! I had one a/c company out and they said it was an electrical problem and they couldn't help. I called numerous places, no one was open, no one returning calls. Then I called Samson and Sons, Mark answered and within 30 minutes Jose was at my door! In less than than 30 minutes of his arrival, Jose had cold air blowing through my home once again. It wasn't what the first company said it was at all. These guys are my heros! Fast, kind, efficient and ready to help. Great job! You are my A/C-guys for life now."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"What a bait and switch move you made on me Eden! Your crew comes out late, and then wants payment at the beginning with hidden fees. I call you and you tell me OH WELL! Then the most insulting part is I agree to pay and you tell the crew to LEAVE because I have a 2 person hot tub. Guess what genius I could of had someone else move it. You lost $85 truck few, and at least 5 hours @ $110/hr. Must be nice to turn down money and screw people. Thanks for screwing this single mom! Your company is scum and your crew even spoke negatively about you. I hope Karma kicks your ass you POS."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I dread hiring contractors in Tucson.  Have found it difficult to find reliable people.  Found AABRITE online and checked them out with BBB and here. Estimate seemed reasonable,  but it was higher than the other bid by about $175.  Rob was personable and the painters were neat (mostly).  Rob said they would return in about a month after the job was finished.  Five weeks later the lead painter came back and walked around looking for anything that might have been missed as well as a couple of minor things I found.  Wasn't a perfect job, but it was much better than my usual experience here. 4.5 stars but rounded up to five."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"True professionals at this tinting shop. I've heard mixed reviews of other tinting shops, so I was wary when I went to get my car tinted. I was greeted warmly, and educated on my options. I found out the tinting has a lifetime warranty against fading, peeling, bubbling, cracking... pretty good! Nice waiting area as well.  They had to take my car seats out, but were kind enough to let me hook them up (insurance reasons) and load my kids inside the shop, as opposed to in the oppressive heat outside. The tinting looks great, and my car is shady and cool in the back.  Go here, don't waste your time with fly by night rip-off places."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Jared was very helpful and prompt with our request for a relocation from Lompoc to Goleta. He sent 3 guys who were very helpful, efficient, fast and friendly. Sterling was the lead and kept checking in with us, did a couple of walk-throughs to ensure what was staying stayed, and to load everything that was coming with us. When they took a slightly longer lunch break, Sterling contacted me via text to provide us with an update and an ETA. Once they had off-loaded everything, they asked if they could help more by moving around boxes to specific rooms/areas. The price was also significantly lower than another bid. We most definitely will recommend their services to family and friends."
Home Services,5.0,CG,"From the moment I called, I was greeted with a response that was more than I could have asked for. I had a friend who was also in the office, so it was clear that we were both in the same room.  The receptionist then proceeded to tell me that I would be a bit more careful with the phone call, but I felt like I was being taken advantage of by the staff.  I asked if there were any other issues with the apartment, and she said ""no.""  I left the apartment feeling like I was being taken advantage of.  She then continued to"

Home Services,3.5,OR,Our drains backed up on a Sunday. Called and was quoted $99 a drain. Joe arrived within the window given and was extremely knowledgable. He walked us through each step and explained everything. He worked for over two hours and unclogged the drains. He then used the camera snake to find out why we were having issues. He determined roots were growing on the city's side of the pipes and reported the issue to the county. He returned the next day to place a clean out valve because he didn't have the parts but didn't charge us an additional call fee. We were super happy with our service and price. We will call these guys again if needed.
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Lived here for a little less than a year. Apartment itself was fine.  Management was not. We had a neighbor with a dog that would come under our balcony and rip our screen door. The dog was in our apartment multiple times by breaking through the screen. Management was told 8+ times and did absolutely nothing. Additionally, they tell you no water or sewage the first month. Don't be fooled by this - they'll charge it to your account after you move out. Finally, lots of hours long unnecessary water shut offs and accidental fire alarms that completely disrupt daily routines, especially when everyone was working from home during quarantine. Overall, wouldn't recommend, especially for how high rent is."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"My wife & I have had the pleasure of working with Matt on two separate occasions. He was with us every step of the way on the purchase of our first home, and answered all of our questions accurately and thoroughly to conclude any doubt we had. When it was time to purchase our second home, Matt was the first person we thought of to contact. He is extremely knowledgeable, even when pitched questions that may be outside of his realm of responsibility. We've referred him to friends and family already, and wouldn't hesitate to refer him again in the future. Matt is by far one of the most genuine & professional individuals in the industry. Thanks again!

Home Services,5.0,OR,"I contracted with Arnold Inspection Services to give our new home a once over.  We were coming up on the end of the 1-year warranty period provided by the builder so I wanted a qualified professional to look over the house top to bottom.   I found Arnold Inspection through Yelp and called them over to do an inspection.   

Brock was the inspector and he was wonderful.  Super thorough, well-experienced, and careful not to make a mess of things.   He found a number of items that I would have never discovered in our daily use of the house.

All in all we are very very pleased with Arnold Inspection Services and highly recommend them!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"DO NOT RENT from this company! They have the most unprofessional staff, with absolutely NO customer Service Skills! Their maintenance men are instructed by the owner, to leave bags of trash in front of resident doors, I've had merchandise stolen out of the garage, and after filing the complaint, was never called, the elevators and Garage doors barely ever work, and to top it all, they have the most disgusting attitudes. Then again, if the owner instructs his staff to leave trash in front of his tenants doors, in a luxury apartment building, I guess you can't expect much from the staff! Don't waste $1,500+ on an apartment here. Get your money's worth somewhere else, where it's appreciated! Buyer Beware!!!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"The company and product came highly recommended.  The Installer called me right back, as the receptionist had promised. The installer was able to estimate the job over the phone. 

The service provided met and exceeded my expectations.  The install team called me prior to their arrival to let me know they would be right on time. They took their time, listened to my concerns and explained how to use and care for my home in relation to the humidifiers they installed. I was grateful for the tutorial and appreciated their patience when I asked questions. 

They wore their protective shoe booties when entering our home and even had a sense of humor! I would highly recommend this company."
Home Services,4.0,OR,I'm looking to move into Varela Westshore. I was greeted as soon as I walked through the office doors. The team was very interactive with me prior to viewing the 2 bedroom - which btw is FABULOUS and after I was done viewing the community. Each person in that office asked me what I thought and how the community made me feel. The only thing was they didn't have availability at this time for me since I'm looking in September. The budget I have was met and I look forward to being apart of Varela in September. Nolan was the best part - he's there after the office closes to give you your package! He's better than the mail man
Home Services,3.5,OR,Regrettably I have an annual service contract with servicemark (which I will not be renewing).  Our heating system broke and the service technician assigned was extremely rude.  When I asked for another technician to be sent to the house because I was uncomfortable having this person in my home (I have 3 small children) they couldn't send another technician over until the following day.  This happened in February during 30 degree weather.  Annual contracts should provide emergency service and it should be delivered by technicians who know how to talk to paying customers.  There are many heating and cooling companies out there and consumers in Philadelphia would be better off seeking services from another company.
Home Services,3.5,CG,"Sorry way over priced. We have had the best experience with them. They are very responsive and do an outstanding job. The office is very friendly and the owner is very courteous. If you're looking for a service to replace your AC, this is the company to call. I would recommend them to anyone.

I called again and he said I had to go to the inspector.  I called again and he said it was a leak from the fence.  I called again and he said he had to go to the inspector.
Home Services,3.5,CG,Awful. We came here after hearing a report of a leak in our kitchen that needed to be repaired. We called the company and they said they would get back to us within a day. We had to call again and they were still not able to get back to us. We called again and they said they could come within the hour and would give us a quote. We called again and they said they would get back to us within a day. We called back a week later and they said they were still not able to get back to us.

Home Services,1.0,OR,I really like the service but needed to cancel. I called their representatives and discussed canceling. I paid my final bill and scheduled termination which was two days into the new billing cycle. I confirmed multiple times I would only be responsible for payment for the two days. Fast forward a month and a bill arrives for my full amount. I call and am told that their policy is to charge the full amount on the first day of the new month even if cancelled. I politely explained my conversation about getting my bill prorated due to canceling two days into the month. To make a long story short they were unwilling to reduce the bill. Stay away from Verizon fios.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I experienced intermittent problems with my 2.5-year-old heating system turning on once the cold weather kicked in and wanted a general servicing and diagnosis of the problem.   I called B&B Heating and Air given its stellar reviews--assessments that I found to be spot on. 

Aaron arrived on time, informed me about what tasks he'd perform and when finished apprised me of everything he checked.  He identified the problem as a dirty flame sensor and told me he'd welcome a call if the problem persists.  He was friendly, informative, professional and best of all, enthusiastic about his trade.  It's very inspiring to see such professionalism in a young man.  I highly recommend B&B Heating and Air."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Excellent plumbing company. We had a laundry room sink installed, and a  new garbage disposal,  as well as additional plumbing for a -new kitchen sink and faucet installed by Don. Don was extremely professional and Don did an outstanding job. We highly recommend Roman plumbing for any of your plumbing needs. Especially Don he is an outstanding employee and is to be commended for his exceptional personality and outstanding pride in his work.  He left the work area completely clean and very very neat when he was finished with his work. He checked all of the plumbing after it was installed to make sure there were no leaks or any problems. Roman plumbing is an outstanding plumbing company."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We used the Yelp mass request for quotes when we were looking for a locksmith to change the locks in a home we just purchased. Carlos responded almost immediately with a breakdown of his charges. His prices seems fair and he could come out the next day. 

Carlos came out as promised and immediately showed his ID and license. Carlos changed the locks for us but also had the correct style, color and brand of 2 more locks that could be keyed on the same key so we had him install those as well. Carlos worked very quickly and without a hitch. His price was very reasonable. 

I would highly recommend Carlos and I will be using him in the future."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Greg is AWESOME! I had several people come out for an estimate on a job I needed and not only was Greg's price right, he is such a nice guy! The job wasn't huge but he treated like it was his priority. He walked me through everything he was going to do to make sure I was satisfied. 

The work could not be better. Our front yard looks like a brand new home! Greg took the time to make sure everything was to my liking and after his perfect cleanup, it looked like a magazine cover! We could not be happier with Greg's work and great personality. We will use Greg again and again and I would recommend him to anyone!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I would give them zero stars if that were an option. We were previously with Quicken Loans (a wonderful company, very customer service focused) and our loan was sold to My Loan Care. They are the WORST. They have lots of hidden fees and never miss an opportunity to take advantage of their customers (unlike Quicken which seemed to bend over backwards to express their appreciation for your business). My Loan Care seems to have intentionally set up a website that is, by design, not user friendly. I suspect their business model is to purposely make it difficult for customers to make payment so that they can collect fees.
Unfortunately we are stuck with them, but avoid this company if you can."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Jeannie Caro was absolutely amazing to work with! From start to finish Jeannie made the process of selling my out of state home extremely easy. She took the time to explain every step in great detail and offered great tips/advice on how to stage my home. She went above and beyond to work with my tenants to schedule showings, worked with my HOA directly to gather pertinent information that was needed and met with/coordinated with the city inspectors to make sure that everything was taken care of. 

Thanks to Jeannie, the entire process was smooth and I did not have to worry about anything! She was a pleasure to work with and I hope to work with her in the future."

There you have it!
Dropped it off last Saturday and 3 hours later,
There she was!!  I even got the front windshield  with the heat resistance... so nice!
I babies the car and kept it in the sun the next day, and in the garage for a few days... the rear window had several air bubbles, but I called and he took a few seconds to smooth them out. 
Now it looks perfect. Will go back in the spring to get our 4Runner done!"
Home Services,1.0,OR,"I initially bought a groupon for them and it took forever to make a connection (like 2 months) then they finally contacted me and we agreed on a time and date and guess what they never showed up , no calls, not anything.  So I spoke to Groupon and they refunded my money and made note.

So then I see them adverstised on the Living Socail site and I emailed Living Social to warn them of the issues I had and to be aware.  i see by reading the other comments that they did nothing except to sell more services.

I can't imagine how these people stay in business!  Glad to know I was not the only one with issues."

Then we just sold that home with her August 2020, Again she was amazing and worked so hard. We got 27 offers on our house and were in contract within 1 day with an above asking price offer!! She was there every step of the way, answered all of our questions and made it so easy! We wish Corissa could travel with us to our new state to help us buy a new home. Thank you again Corissa for making this process so easy! We wish you nothing but the best!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Unbelievable how unprofessional the so called owner Alesha is. Chip on her shoulder with already existing customers. I paid over $1000 for tile cleaning and sealant on 800 sq ft. Job was okay, they were supposed to be back to clean the carpet, I had to wait two weeks for them to return, but the day of the scheduled service they switch my tech. I called to find out why and to voice out my discontent and she said she was not obligated to service anyone. I ended up hiring a different company for a much better price with a more complete service. I called corporate to complain and they really could not do much. Don't over pay. It's not worth it!"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! 

This company is a COMPLETE joke!! They scheduled us and gave us a time frame, and took our deposit money. The day of the move I called them an hour before the window they gave us and said they will give us a 30 minute heads up when they were on their way. We did not hear from them for hours later until I called the owner and he said they can't move us. REALLY???? They did not give us ANY heads up what so ever that they were behind! We had everything out of the storage unit ready to go, and they can't do it. They offered us our deposit back and that's it! 
Total Joke!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"What a super team!!!! We had an emergency, our original movers were in an accident. I started calling every company in the area, superior movers just happened to have a cancellation and took on a move from PA to CT! They saved me and my 94 yr old mother! I wish I called them first. The guys were so personable and responsible, we just stayed out of the way for them. We finally all made it to CT at 1am, they set up all the furniture and even hooked up the cables to the TV!!!!!  I'm sure they didn't make it back to Philly before 6am.... No additional charges!!!!! Thank you so much for saving us, I will be recommending you!!!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"The absolute worst. I had to stand there and give him pointers. He said he needed to remove the tile around my roman tub which is not covered under a home warranty. The tile removal was in fact not required. I reached out to the home warranty company and they agreed to get me another plumber to fix the leaking faucet.
Also, the plumber did not even cover his shoes and tracked filth in to my home before I even noticed he wasn't wearing covers. Also, on the second visit (while he was trying to figure out how to fix the problem) his COVID face mask was removed when I went to check on him in my bathroom. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!!!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I toured probably 10 different apartment complexes before I decided on Aurora. I have not experienced any of the issues or concerns from the other people leaving negative reviews. 

Greg, the Assistant Manager, has been extremely helpful and caring throughout the move-in process(a month ago) and afterwards. He sold me on this place, because he gets it. Not once did he try and forcefully sell me on Aurora. He gave me the facts, answered my questions and genuinely cared about my decision. The other employees I've encountered have also been kind and helpful. I have NOT encountered a disgruntled employee here.

I can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion, you would be happy and have no regrets making Aurora your new home."

I called back on September 9th and was told that they had already been called. I had to leave a message and an email stating that I had to call back within 24 hours to get another reply.

Well, it's been a month and a half. I have not heard back from them. I haven't seen them since. I called them several times over the past month and they said they will get back to me within the next few days. I called again and received a very unprofessional response. I called back on April 1, and was told they would not call me back until the next week."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"This place is no good by any means. Sky high rent and electric bills.  Faulty and very old Comcast wires. Maintenance steals from you and the office workers are rude liars. Very nasty people overall. Nasty place. Appliances take a year to come in, I don't know why we pay so much. The pictures are an inaccurate depiction of the homes. I don't know where they got the pictures of the nice kitchen and spacious living rooms but those are not in these homes. I wish these people would stop lying to make a buck. I got out while I still could living in a great place just out of town. Take heed, and do not give this place a second thought."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"It was such a pleasure working with Master's Tree and Lawn Care for landscaping that involved concrete work, rocks, sod and moving irrigation.  Jeff is very punctual, professional and nice.  His quote was fair, and the job actually came in under budget!  He coordinated very well with his sub (for concrete) and took practical considerations into account.  (My lawn was a bit wet, and he realized that wheel barrows could cause damage, so he advised me to let it dry out overnight and he pushed some work back a day to accommodate.)  His crew was friendly and professional, and Jeff was on site enough to make sure the job was done right.  I highly recommend this firm."

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES THE PLACE FOR ANYONE! 
1.) We have mold in the house, maintenance has been comd at least 10 times they have dine NOTHING!
2.) They turn off the water woithout notice regularly! Sometimes just the hot water isnt working which means cold showers
3.) The heat in the place cannot keep up! The apt drops to 50 degrees!
4.) The fire alarm has gone off over 5 times with no fire and no notice of a drill, which is EXTREMELY dangerous as people no longer leave their apt!
5.) The place is FILTHY
6.) There is one elevator which often doesnt work
7.) All the gyms havent had cleaning material in them. Disgusting!!!!!!!!!

Stay AWAY from ALDEN PARK APARTMENTS"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Truly 3 1/2 stars! 
When we moved into the town-home side the choice of resident was young professional, quiet respectful, great community. The occasional rich parent sending their kid to USF but nothing bad. After staying for 3 years we watched the steady decline of resident, loud parties, almost fraternity like, tons of people coming and going, shifty drive byes, thing that make you go ""why am I paying this rent for this crap?"" "" & how in God's name can these idiots afford it???"" 
Seriously had to call the cops multiple times! 
The property is beautiful, the apartments are amazing, if you remove the bad element & new maintenance staff (80% rude only 1 nice guy) maybe get close to 5 stars!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"As long as there are no issues with your documents or any corrections needing to be made then this company has good customer service. However, my husband and I had a misspelling on our deed that needed to be corrected before we could do the signing on our refinance.  Twice a Notary was sent out with the wrong documents for us to sign and we were running the risk of default on our current loan. I placed multiple calls to their customer service lines to get resolution, but it always seemed to go nowhere. This was a time sensitive issue, but it didn't seem very important to Freedom Mortgage. In the future I will not be inclined to finance with this company."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I've been wanting an outside outlet on the house and tree lights for a long time. John Yeomans from Gen3 came out, assessed the electrical needs, mapped out a plan, and advised me on the best way to proceed. There were a lot of things I didn't think about. We ended up with two new direct lines from our panel, one going to second floor and one at ground level. Once I purchased the lights he came back and spent hours doing the work - so impressed with his attention to detail and the artistic way he wrapped the lights. It really was perfect. Maybe a small thing, but it made us so happy. Neighbors loved it, too. Highly recommend him."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"The worst customer service!! My can was missed on Monday so i called Tuesday, and then again everyday because it was never picked up as the customer service rep promised every day. On Friday I asked to speak to a supervisor, who assured me it was on the schedule again and would without fail be picked up by 6pm. After 6pm it still had not been picked up, customer service was closed, but automated system says the pickup has been deferred to Monday. My regular pick up day!! If I'd known that all week I'd have just put it back in my garage and saved myself the aggravation of all those phone calls. Good example of how monopolies don't need to provide service!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Yes, yes, yes!  These guys came recommended by another moving company that was booked the weekend I wanted to move, and I couldn't be happier with their service!  Riqo and Malachi arrived on time and worked quickly. They secured my furniture so there would be no scratches, moved my boxes, and even helped me throw out items I didn't want to bring with me. The whole move--from start to finish--took 2 hours. 2 HOURS. Therefore, the entire bill was $240--and I would have paid more (shhh!). Riqo and Malachi were super-friendly, as well. I highly recommend this company. They made my move impossibly easy. (Note, however, that I think they only move one bedroom apartments."

In that time they couldn't even successfully wipe down kitchen counter tops or sweep a floor clean in a brand new home which was also empty. Complained to the owner and even sent pictures of the dirt wiped up on the counter BY ME right after his employees left and pics of my dirty floor that I SWEPT, he suggested I should have paid for more time. My suggestion is if 2 of your employees can't sweep a floor clean and mop it as requested as well as wipe down kitchen counter tops in 2 hours more time is not the problem, your business is and how you run it.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"Extremely unprofessional and rudeness that bordered on outright hostility.  The company sent techs on three separate occasions and failed to fix our AC unit. After spending several hundreds of dollars to ""fix"" the unit, the company suggested we purchase a new one. When I called to ask about the failure to fix the unit despite the money spent, the rep was rude, unprofessional and told me the soonest anyone could provide a quote would be after the weekend. After the rep literally hung up on me, I called a competitor and received a call from a tech within an hour (after hours on a Friday evening) and a text about a quote the next day. I'll be taking my business to the competition."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"This apartment complex and their management are complete trash. The entire complex shares a single hot water heater, so water pressure and temperature are gone if someone else decides to shower, use the faucet, or flush the toilet while your showering. There is a recurring history of black mold in EVERY apartment. The prices constantly rise without notice. If your neighbor smokes meth or pot, the smoke WILL travel into your apartment, and neither Mary Zdraljevic
the Property Manager or Alison Gorelick the owner will do anything about it. They steal your security deposit to ""recarpet"" the apartment with no proof of who carpeted it or how much it was. Gorelick Real Estate is all con artist and liars. Read the reviews, do your homework."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"This company, in association with Amerigas, has horrible customer service and business practices.  After a year of good propane prices, suddenly the price per gallon doubled without notice.  After days of attempts to reach customer service, I reached someone who I could barely understand and the connection was poor.  Lots of apology, no resolution.  Had to go to the local office in person.  Apologetic again about customer service but we asked to stop delivery.  A month later, while we were out of town, they made another delivery.  Not authorized at the new double price.   Again, we cannot reach anyone and will have to go in person to complain.  Don't go anywhere near this company."

We were a little bummed because we booked a flight over the downtown area and didn't find out until we arrived that there was a flight restriction over the downtown area due to a game at the stadium so our flight was rerouted to the Opry mall area. The scenery wasn't as pretty and it was mostly flying over residential houses. It was fun though, and I definitely think we will fly again when we can actually fly over downtown. Our pilot was great. He was chatty, calmed our nerves, and gave us great recommendations for ""things to do"" in Nashville. I definitely suggest calling before you book to check flight restrictions :)."
Home Services,3.5,OR,My AC stopped working last year and it was the fan not starting but didn't look into it too much at the time.  I had these guys out and they quoted some outrageous prices only AFTER the guy had done the work so there was no way to say no.  I opted for the lowest option which was still $395 to replace a $10 capacitor that took 10 minutes to do.  After looking into things myself i then figured out how easy and cheap a fix this really was and feel totally ripped off. If you call them make sure you get their quoted price before you let them start working and I'd be highly suspicious of their grossly inflated prices.
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Response from owner was always very prompt and courteous.  They were also prompt at arriving the day of the move.

Honestly, I was worried sick about any service charging by the hour since my funds are quite limited. But, to my relief these movers did not dawdled - they worked carefully and steadily in both the unloading and unloading of my belongings.  They were also very attentive and careful with anything marked as fragile. They wrapped the furniture well and with great care. 

The final charges were more than fair... Especially considering the care they showed in handling my things.

VERY PROFESSIONAL FROM BEGINNING TO END. I will definitely be calling them for my next move, and will recommend them to friends and relatives."

James George answered all my questions, advised of their use of high quality - American made parts, arrived on site less than an hour later, text me photos of the issue, and called to confirm a final out the door price before commencing work.  He even advised me that a portion of their profit goes to Awaken (a charity to fight against sex trafficking in our area).  So far I am thoroughly impressed."

In 2020, once the pandemic began to take hold of my business I was quick to eliminate all non-essential items in my budget to weather the storm.  Knowing that the pest control is mandatory in Florida, I retained that relationship and cancelled my lawn maintenance in April of 2020.  Much to my dismay within about 6 months despite all my extra efforts, my yard had noticeably deteriorated. I am resuming my service and impressed with the 'special treatment' that they have provided me when welcoming me back."

I found Breeze Heating and Cooling on Nextdoor, talked to Kam late this morning, and by this afternoon he replaced a broken piece and had our unit up and running again for a total of $200 including parts and labor. Needless to say, I am thrilled that we can get some more use out of this unit and we have Air Conditioning again. Thank you Kam for your knowledge, honesty, quick response time and repair! Definitely a business I would highly recommend and use again."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"They were hired by my agent, to inspect a house we were looking to buy in Bala Cynwyd.  Listed all sort of stupid things like, couldn't open windows.  Also reported that the gutters were not draining and that the roof didn't drain correctly.  We decided to hire a roofer.  He said that the gutters were fine and that the roof had another 3-5 years left on it.

I climbed up on the roof with the roofer, to look for myself.  As for the gutters, they had some leaves and twigs in them.  Nothing terrible!  And the roof looked good.

Oh, and the windows; our 8 year old was able to open them.
We bought the house.

Will never, ever use them again."

They love my dog in the office, the staff is exceptionally friendly, the parking is flexible and allows visitors much better than basically all of my friends in the area, and any issues I ever have are dealt with immediately. There is a ton of green space which is especially nice for dog-walking. It's a 5-10 minute drive (depending on West End traffic) to the furthest end of Vandy campus and ~ten minutes to Green Hills, the Gulch, Midtown, Edgehill. Can't beat the pools and with the upgrades I truly couldn't suggest a complex more!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I hate this service and the people that run it. They will swindle your money, cut your service off and tell you you are months behind on payment when you can visually prove otherwise. They do this in small amounts to avoid litigation. 

Their customer service is absolutely horrific, I had better when I was on a ship in the middle of the Suez Canal. Their call centers are based in Craplakistan and you cannot understand their agents when they are robbing your account. When you do get an American, it is typically some man that tries to sound hard and bully you into paying unwarranted charges.

Inferior service and they do not care for their customers one bit.ROTTEN TO THE CORE! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"

I had to replace a key and then the key was not working.  The technician came out and said that the key would be working.  I asked for the technician to call me back.  He came out and said that the technician had not called me back.  I called again and had to ask him to call me back.

When I called them the next day, they told me the move was scheduled for 4pm and that they had no way of knowing when they would be. This was obviously a joke and I would not recommend them to anyone. I called them several times over the phone to confirm the move was being held. When I finally got a call from them on Sunday, I told them I had no idea what to do with my belongings and they immediately offered me a $99.00 ""fine"" to move my things and put them in storage"
Home Services,2.5,CG,"U haul has really gone down. The guys at Reno Roofing did an excellent job! 

I am very happy with the work they did!I have had a lot of bad experiences with this company. 

I was referred to them by an excellent online salesman who said he was looking to get a quote for a new roof. 

I was told the quote was $8,000 and that I would need to get a quote from another roofing company before I could get another one. 

I called the owner and she said she was in a rush and had to call back. "
Home Services,4.5,CG,"We had two shower/tub combos that were the only two in the house. The shower was a bit older than the rest of the house, but they did have a couple of great spots to use it. We were happy with the size of the shower. I was also happy with the location. We moved in about a month after the shower, and the shower was clean and well maintained. They did a great job with the insulation, and the two men who came to clean it were very professional and friendly. They did a great job. I highly recommend these guys!We are so pleased with the service we received from Our"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"The man that inspected the home we bought also inspected the home we sold. He made an inappropriate comment to my wife about getting into the shower. My wife did not react how I think he hoped.

I don't know if that exchange prompted all of the issues following but it was enough to make us wonder. The home we sold had a couple things on the report that we had to pay a plumber and another company to look at the gas shutoff. Both were found not to be issues at all, just as anyone with even basic home knowledge could have guessed. 

Almost three years later at our new home we're dealing with issue after issue that should have been in the initial inspection report."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"My daughter and I recently visited The Village at Terra Bella and were quoted a price for an apartment. She then applied on-line and called the next day to say the price was not what was quoted. They said it would be fixed, but was not and ended up $50 more per month than the quote. The manager was extremely rude and said they would not return the $75 application fee. It was a bait and switch. Taking advantage of someone applying for their first apartment and just stealing their money. I would not recommend leasing from these people. If this is the way you are treated prior to moving in, I'd hate to see the customer service you receive once you've moved in."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"The worst at customer service, where it counts.  Any company can monitor you, a lot of them farm it out to the same place.  When you need service, they not only suck, but the representative was rude and sarcastic.  The, of course, they try to stick you with a bill for a contract that extends itself into infinity.   
You do not want them; there are better companies for security monitoring.  All they want is your monthly payments. When they can perform, they hit you with a ""contract,"" even after ten years of steady payments.  Bad, bad, bad.  Stay away.  If you get stuck with them for some reason, renegotiate your contract so it does not automatically renew."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"We used college hunks moving for our move last week and they were very receptive and prompt.  The scheduling was easy and the quote was competitive to other local movers.  The ""Hunks"" did a good job of following up on my upcoming move and the gentlemen they sent out arrived early and when they realized they may not finish within the quoted time, they had 2 more ""hunks"" sent out to help unload the truck at no additional cost to me.  If you are going to use a moving service I would recommend College Hunks they were definitely interested in securing my business and satisfaction with the work completed and the ""Hunks"" were polite and worked hard to stay within the quoted time."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Used Thompson to troubleshoot a heating issue with my radiator as well as inspect the old boiler in the basement in my house in Fairmount.  Vince the owner answered each time I called and was very helpful over the phone.  John showed up on time and was extremely knowledgeable, courteous, and personable.  He was able to fix my radiator and provide an honest assessment of my heating system.  He's got 30 years of experience, is very knowledgeable, and took time to explain the entire heating system to me.  Both guys get an A in customer service, & the job cost exactly as what was quoted over the phone.  I highly recommend them, and will definitely use them in the future."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Brandi! First it doesn't matter that it was a month ago.  I just now had the time to express my concerns regarding your lack of quality service.  By the time your person contacted me it was to late to come back because I took care of the ""Cleaning"" myself!  Plus she DID NOT offer to come back!!! So that is a lie!!  I did not expect your crew to make the condo look new, just CLEAN!  They didn't!  I will NEVER use your service and I suggest anyone looking for a cleaning service to pass you up.  How dare you come back at me like lack of service is my problem.  No customer service, no quality, NO GOOD!"
Home Services,4.5,CG,"It was one of the few things I thought about when I saw the trailer for the move. The owner, B.B.C. took pride in his work and was very courteous and professional. It was a very nice move. I would definitely use him again in the future.We used them for a house cleaning and they were great! They did a great job cleaning up after us and had our apartment cleaned up right away. They did an excellent job of cleaning up our carpets and cabinets. The price was reasonable too.We called for our first time cleaning in a while and it was a long time coming."
Home Services,1.5,CG,What is even the point of an AC system?  I will say that my AC was not broken.  I had a leaky valve and then the tank was filled with water and that tank was leaking.  I called a local company and told them I had to replace the valve.  They said they could come out and replace the valve but the tank was leaking so I called another company.  This time I called a local company and told them I had to replace the valve and it was leaking again.  The tank was leaking again and they said it was not leaking.  I called another company and told them that they

We've had two different tenants and the most recent one is the first one to move in and we had a huge issue with the outside of our apartment. I called and spoke to the manager who said she was looking into this issue and would be in touch soon. She told me that she'd be there when she could and I would be there by Monday. I called a few days later and they were still waiting on my number and they said they were out of the city. They said they'd be back by Tuesday morning.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"My husband and I used Dave's Carpet Cleaning today, and were very happy with the results.  We live in a rental home so the carpeting isn't  ""top of the line;"" however, Dave and Ricky did an outstanding job of making them look pretty good. I asked Dave if he could clean a spot on my cedar chest (top is cotton cloth), and he did the entire top and it came out looking great!  Dave and Ricky are true professionals and it shows in the quality of their work. I highly recommend Dave's Carpet Cleaning not only because of his reasonable cost, but because of his professionalism.  When he quotes you a price, that's the price you are going to pay..........no ""hidden"" add ons!"

However, these guys are amazing.  They mean what they say and say what they mean, which seems to be quite rare in these parts.  I got another estimate and Louisiana Tree Company was much more competitive. They cleaned up after themselves and provided service beyond the call of duty.  I nicely asked to poke some holes in the stumps and they graciously offered free of charge. They also did an excellent job on trimming my palm trees.  The whole team was excellent & professional. Now if they only do paint jobs...."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I highly recommend this small local business for your carpet needs. Completely professional and courteous with everything. I needed my carpet restretched back to my tile as the tack nails were poking out and cutting knees, fingers & toes on my kids. They advised against transfer plates due to the risk of tripping and installed a latex that helps keep the carpet sealed to the tile. I was able to test all of my doorways to my satisfaction before they left and if I need anything they will put me as priority which makes me feel valued as a customer. James all around cares and does awesome work with his assistant Eric. Both very stand up guys and I highly recommend as their pricing is also unbeatable!"

I have never gotten any noise complaints for playing an instrument in my garage completely considerate of other people.

They are polite and fix the issue at hand.  How ever the office is a total disaster they never repay service calls on time they aren't knowledgeable about the apartments they rent. There just sales people. And last but not least PARKING is awful for 1300 a month you think I would have a parking spot but nope we all share with vehicles and trailers, which aren't aloud fyi. But dare you curb park or on the grass or handicap spot you will be towed that night with no empathy. Been here 26 months.  Absolutely cannot wait to leave."

For months after our sale, Jessi and Emily worked around the clock, our crazy schedules and our specific requirements to show us houses. We finally decided to build and moved into our new home less than a month ago. Jessi was available to us through it all. I recommend Jessi and her team every time I get the chance."

I felt comfortable knowing he was going to do a great job and him and his crew delivered! His crew was upbeat and happy, a pleasure to have around.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"This place is awful, 
First parking, you only get one spot for 4or 5 people. The rest have go look for parking in IV which sucks. And sometimes the only spot u get is taken by someone else and management doesnt care.
Second you cant pla music after 10 pm on weeknds or u could get kicked out,wtf with that this is a college city. Management is super strict  and u get evicted after 3 complains, which depends if the dumb security guys tall on you and ur roomates.
Then they always have people working outside with their loud machinery and at 8am and if u are like me u shoukd be sleeping at that time

Conclusion this may be cheap rent, but this place sucks. Try to avoid it."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"This was our first time using SK Heating and Air Conditioning and I am thrilled.  Saki, the owner of the company, came to my home to diagnose a problem I've been with the heating unit and to service it as well.  He took the time to explain to me how the system worked and thoroughly investigated all potential issues.  The solution he proposed involved some simple fixes to my existing system instead of a complete replacement as another company suggested when they came out to look at it.  He was patient in answering my questions and cleaned up everything when he was done working.  On top of all that, their prices are very reasonable.  I couldn't ask for more.  Very satisfied."

We used a Latter and Blum agent who rented us an apartment owned by another agent. They misrepresented almost everything about the apartment - and the landlord proved to be completely unresponsive to our needs during the duration of our rental. Both the agent who showed us properties and our landlord, both Latter and Blum employees, proved to be unethical and unprofessional. Now that we are looking to buy a home, we will not consider using any realtors from Latter and Blum as two of their representatives have already proved that they're not a trustworthy company."

They didn't have masks on and broke our leg of the couch. Not professional at all.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Team Hustle moving helped our family move. There are three things I love about them. First, they promised two people; but brought three! The extra set of hands helped us move quickly. Second, they had blankets and saran wrap. They wrapped up our furniture so that it did not get scratched. Something some of their competitors do not do. Third, they did not waste any time.  We lost the keys to our new home and were frantically looking for them. Instead of waiting around and wasting time, they unloaded the items while we looked for them. They did not waste a minute of time. If you want people that truly hussle and don't go slow to charge you more, then they would be a great team to contact."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"After getting five other bids ranging from ridiculously high to competitive, (an incredible $1,300 range) a neighbor in my condo insisted that I give 'her guys' a call. I'm $o glad I did.
Brian answered all of my questions over the phone and provided a solid bid to beat all others by $200.00! And instead of a lesser known brand... AMANA!
His installation crew arrived EARLY (so rare in Florida) and completed the meticulous installation by 2:30. Great team work by installation pros. 
Before you make a decision, you owe it to yourself to get a competitive bid from Brian. As one of only FOUR Amana dealers in the entire county (Pinellas) you can take comfort (pun intended) in relying on them.

Home Services,3.0,OR,I wrote a review on this company a couple of weeks ago. They contacted me right away of course so I would remove my review. They said I would be refunded my service fee by the end of last week. Still no refund. So my review is back up. I was left in the heat on July 4th weekend because they opted for the choice to make more profit rather than do the right thing and fix my unit. My husband found the part himself and another company fixed it in a very short time in the same day after Total HVAC mad me wait 4 days. Now they won't refund me when they said they would. It doesn't take that long to refund a credit card. Shady company.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Six weeks before our move from California to Tennessee, we contacted Ethan Lanagan. After supplying him with our home preferences and preferred locations, he immediately sent us emails of property either on the market or soon to be that fit our criteria. The emails had the ability to make comments and ask questions to which we received prompt replies from Ethan. Ethan was also helpful in the sale of our California home because he is licensed in both states. He helped us successfully navigate property inspections, real estate documents and disclosures, etc. Ethan's calm demeanor during what could have been a very stressful time was reassuring particularly considering California's 45-day and Tennessee's 15-day escrows. It was a pleasure to work with such a professional agent. We highly recommend Ethan!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,This is by far the worst security system you can sign up for.  They do not do service calls to support the system.  You receive an email on the 24th of October that the tablet will no longer work with the system by 10/31/17 and to please verify your shipping address.  Done immediately only to fine out it takes 7 to 14 days to receive.  So if it takes 14 days you have to pay for 7 days with no security because the pad in not compatible.  You would think a great company or at least a good company would have gotten the email out before October.  Their support is the worst.  My 3 years is almost up and I cannot wait.

I love the fact that they are a family owned company.  My husband and I have lived here for over two years and have always been very happy with our experience.  Our house is very clean and we really love living here!  They are very responsive and super friendly and we love the amenities and amenities that are
Home Services,2.0,CG,"I recently moved out of a house and needed to make repairs.  When I got home, the owner called me the next day, said that he had a ""good"" day and that I needed to call them in a few days.  I called and got a call back from the manager.  He was quick to respond and said that he had a good day and I needed to call him in a few days.  I called him and told him that I needed to call him in a few days and that I would have to call him in a few days.  He said that he had a good day and that I was doing it"
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Very great service and value. We will be using them again for all our plumbing needs!Very disappointed. We had an old dishwasher, a small refrigerator, and a new dishwasher. We had to take our dishwasher outside to get it repaired. This was our first time using this company and it's been a long time since we have had a dishwasher. We've had issues with the main breaker, but not the unit itself. The dishwasher came off when I got home from work. I called the service company and they said it was a fault with the system. They said it was fixed and we will have it back up in"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
I had an issue with the air conditioning in my house for about a week. I called the company and they said they would get back to me within a day. The next day I received a call saying I would have to call the service to get the heat back on. They said they would come out and get the heat back on. I called back and got a different phone number. They said they were not able to get the heat back on because of the heat bill. I called back and the next day I received a call saying the heat was out. I called back and got a different phone number"
Home Services,2.5,CG,"Does NOT tell the truth. We have had the same issues for a year now. I have been in a two-story apartment for over a year and have had to leave a lot of items that were not there. I have been charged for multiple items (skeletal items, carpet items, a 2 bedroom bathroom). I have also had issues with the office staff (they have been very rude to me). They have not even responded to any of my requests for information regarding the repairs that they have done. I have been told that I will be charged for maintenance, not just for a rent increase. I have had no luck with the maintenance"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Customer service and price are unmatched! My insurance company (one of the 3 large companies in St. Louis) doesn't cover windshield repair, but Tedd, Shawn and team worked with me to quickly get my windshield taken care of. I would recommend this company to anyone after requesting a quote yesterday and getting my windshield repaired in less than 24hrs! And bonus they come to you! At first I was going to go with the largely marketed company you hear about, but their quote seemed high so I continued my search and I'm so glad I did! I was able to get 8 chips repaired for less than the other company quoted for one chip. The work is also guaranteed and has a lifetime warranty. I'm thankful I found these guys!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,Frontier has the worse customer service there is! My elderly parents have issues with their internet for 4 days...once I was able to get through they finally decided a technician was needed (after trips to swap out routers). Then they schedule an appointment for September 23rd stating this was the earliest available appointment. The was 2 weeks away. So they are supposed to go without all their services for 2 weeks. When you are signing up with the company it's amazing how they can get someone out next day... But if something goes wrong with the service you can't get someone out for two weeks. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced. If you cannot use frontier that would be your best idea. Frontier is an awful company.
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Another 2/10 warranty A/C repair. First visit was prompt and said they needed to replace leaking condensate pan which they had to order. Nine days later, keeping in mind this is Tucson in the summer, they came to replace and, after several hours working on it,said they had ordered the wrong size and they would reorder on a two day rush basis. A week later I called them with no return call. Called again several days later and they said they hadn't returned my call because they had ""nothing to tell me"". After four more days I called 2-10 and now there is a different company coming out Monday (it's Friday). Hope they are better. Original request made to 2-10 on7/27 and its 8/19."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Great work by Eric.  

He sent a courtesy text message letting me know he was on his way and arrived on schedule for both of his visits, the day he came to measure and order, and the day that he came to do the installation.

The only pain point i have is way beyond his control, they had to place a custom order for the right size pane for the job, and It took 15 days from the day that he came to measure, until the order arrived and he installed our broken pane.  

All in all, great work, good service, no complaints, i'd say i would work with them again but i am not looking forward to any more broken windows any time soon.  knock on wood."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Taylor and his team at Northern Nevada Window Tinting did a phenomenal job on my car. He was readily available to answer all my questions over the phone prior to my appointment, and was thorough with his explanations and recommendations on the day of my appointment. 3 days after my tint was done, I noticed a small imperfection in one piece. I told Taylor about it, and he immediately and without hesitation had me come back in to get the piece replaced. He knew I was headed out of town soon, and wanted to make sure I was fully satisfied with his work. I can not recommend these guys enough on the great job they did and their excellent customer service. Will recommend to my friends and family for sure."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I have know Josh for several years.  He is one of the top agents in the country.  I have masterminded with him several times, and he is pushing the real estate industry forward.  He is very progressive, and always looking to grow.  From the time I have know Josh, I can tell you he is an all around good guy.  He cares about the client, client experience, and doing the right thing.  He is not out there to make a buck, but to create relationships and always looking at how he can help others.  He has been a great resource for me and my business, and is always willing to share great ideas to help improve the real estate industry as a whole."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"We ordered a 2nd POD, since we ran out of space, once we were 1/2 way through loading it, we noticed a large split in the ceiling. We called PODS, the guy on the other end of the phone was not apologetic, said he can have another sent in 2 days (mind you the POD yard is about 15 mins from our house). We decided to patch the large crack in the ceiling with duct tape, since we hired people to help us load & they were only available Saturday when we were packing up. Thank God we paid for indoor storage, so our stuff won't get wet if it rains, but they never offered a discount. Very unprofessional. The delivery guy Ryan was a gem, very sweet & kind."
Home Services,2.0,CG,"This is the most outrageous and unprofessional company we've ever dealt with!We have been using this company for over a year now.   The staff is friendly, professional, and does a great job.    We will use them again if we need to.

They were a bit pricey for what I needed, but they did the job with a smile and professionalism.    We will definitely use them again for any project.I have been using this company for about 6 months now and I have been extremely pleased with the service and service.  I have a great feeling about their services.   They provide a great price"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Heat went out on Saturday. We had the AC running in two hours. When it came time to install the water heater the AC broke, and the technician said we had to take it out. After we had it fixed we called the manager and he told us he had to charge us for the water heater. He said he would call me back and we would be reimbursed. I called the manager again and he said he would charge us for the water heater and that he would not be able to come out to fix the water heater. I called the manager again and he said he would call me back and I would be reimbursed."
Home Services,3.0,CG,This is THE apartment complex that has the worst reviews. I will not recommend this complex to anyone.I had an issue with the power meter and then the unit was stopped.

After a week of waiting, they said they would be here within a week. They had no idea what was going on with the dishwasher and they had to call me back to come out. They didn't seem to care and they were rude and rude to me. We are very disappointed.We had a very nice young couple come out.  They were very professional, courteous and very professional.

Home Services,5.0,CG,Called today due to compressor issues. The technician was very professional and polite. He explained what happened and what we needed to do. The technician took the time to explain the problem and made sure it was fixed in no time. I would highly recommend them. Very professional and professional. The guys were extremely fast and very quick to respond to my request. I had to wait 3 days for a technician to come out to install a unit and to install a new one. They came out within 2 hours. I would highly recommend them. Will definitely use them again for our next system!I'm a student living at St. Pete.
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Currently paying $245 a month for an AC unit, which is a lot for a small town, we had an extra $100 for a ""free"" AC unit, which is very reasonable. 

The only issue I have is that there are no cell phone service. The tech said he would call me back within the hour, which was a little on the pricey side, but I didn't mind. 

This place is on a busy day, so I had to drive about 30 minutes to get there, so I was stuck in traffic for about an hour.

Overall, it's a great place to live, but it"
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Totally unreliable!!! We never left a voicemail with them. I emailed them my name and email and they said they would call me back, but they never did. 

We sent pictures of the house and we were told it would be repaired. I called to ask if they would be able to come out to look at it, but they never did. I was so upset that I called again and had to leave a message with them. 

I feel very sorry for them and their employees. I hope the future owners will use this company for all of their future needs.I needed an estimate for a home that needed some work"
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Just wanted to thank Michael, the owner, for the great service he provided us. I would recommend him to anyone.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"As an out of state income property owner with an emergency plumbing issue, you want a company with excellent customer service and professional ability to handle tenant issues with reasonable respect and decorum.  After calling the owner, Jasper, myself it was clear he was not willing to hear our concerns and for lack of a more appropriate term, he was a bully and threatening. It is not my nature to write negative reviews, yet while attempting to have a ""meeting of the minds"" - communication went from poor to disastrous. This is a situation where it is necessary to post my experience and would not recommend due to aggressive tone and non-flexibility. It is unfortunate we could not come to an understanding which was equitable, rather than posturing and abusive."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"T&H Realty manages my properties in Indianapolis for the past 2+ years. As an out-of-state investor, having a property management team I can depend on and trust is crucial. I've been very pleased with the responsiveness, efficiency and reliability of T&H team. Whenever I contact the T&H team, not only do they respond in a timely manner, but also address my questions fully with an understanding of the ""why"" behind the question. I can trust T&H to handle any issues, carry it across the finish line while keeping me informed each step of the way.

I have and am working with other property managers across the country, and T&H is the high bar that I measure my other property managers against. I couldn't be more pleased with T&H as my property manager."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"My experience with Real Property Management was great.  I recently rented a home for over a year and always had prompt, courteous and professional interactions with the office team; Mary Lou and John.  My only regret is I wasn't able to stay in the home longer as the owners wanted to move back to the property.  Although I had very little issues with the property during my lease, any time I had a question or concern a response was always very prompt.  I hadn't rented a home in over 25 years prior to this experience and was a bit nervous due to horror stories I had heard about management companies.  With the great experience I had with RPM, I wouldn't hesitate to work with them again."
Home Services,2.0,OR,Unfortunately I just moved here without reading yelp. I recently just got a call from the management stating that I have yet to pay my rent. And I was just so flabbergasted by that statement only because when I moved here they said the rent that I'm paying is for January. So instead of calling me in the beginning of January they decided to wait till the 18th to say I have to pay it now. But not only that we have to pay it on the 1st of February as well. The only thing I'm really frustrated with is the lack of communication and no written copies for the tenants. So it's our word against theirs.. I just wish they would actually be more professional about how they run things.
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I didn't realize how solid this hotel was until I stayed at a vastly inferior one the following weekend. All in all, it's a very swank place that convinces you the splurge was worth it. The rooms are fantastic, with great bedding, wonderful bathrooms, and enormous televisions.  (Nice bath products as well.) Both the rooms themselves and the lobby have character. They really drive home the fact that you're in Nashville (in case you'd forgotten). The staff was pretty friendly and helpful (especially the cleaning staff). Conference rooms were a lot larger and more AV-friendly than places I've been in the past. The fitness room is decent, with towels, water, and apples available. A good place to stay if you've got money to burn or are expensing  the trip."
Home Services,1.5,OR,Worst hotel room I've ever stayed in!! We traveled all the way from upstate NY and paid $150 for one night!! It smelled like somones musty basement! The cabinet doors were hanging from the hinges in the kitchen. The inside of the dishwasher AND stove were dirty. There was a baby cockroach crawling on the bathroom wall. There's black mold growing in the bathroom. My girlfriend didn't even want to lay on the bed (the mattress was hard as a rock) She even slept in her jeans and jacket she wore to the concert we went to. Our complimentary breakfast were some granola bars and shitty coffee. Best believe we complained and threatened to call corporate. We were then issued a full refund! I will NEVER go back to this place
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Sunset Vista Apts. Only cares about the almighty dollar! I have lived here 3 years and there has been 4 managers. They say they are pet friendly but there isnt any grass and unless the residents take care of the watering of the grounds, everything would be dead. There is homeless people that come onto the property at night because there is large holes in the fence. Alot of drug activity! The new manager this month, Stephanie came to my apt. to yell at me and tell me to get rid of my patio table and barbeque. I had never even met her before. She was so rude!!! There is alot of retired people that live here, the owner keeps raising the rent and water every year."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Hands down the best contractor we've ever dealt with.  We started with our designer/salesman, Dominic, who made the process of designing our pool easy and exactly what we wanted. Then the construction manager, Paul, and the entire crew who came by on a regular basis (Warren/ Taylor/Todd) and made the construction go more smoothly than we ever thought possible. And a special thanks to Sara for handling all of our questions and calls. The whole process from beginning to end exceeded all our expectations and then some.  From every design detail to all the finishing touches they worked with us without any hesitations.  They are an honest company that puts customer satisfaction first! They were true to their word, budget, timeline and commitment to a beautiful quality product."

I had a leak on my well, wasn't an emergency but Chris still quickly got me on the schedule and came out to fix my issue.  Turns out that the leak must have been going on longer than I though by the number of roots they had to work through but Double R is nothing but professional!!  I am very happy with their work and felt their fee was honest and fair.

It'd be nice if I never had well issues again but if I do, Chris at Double R is my first call, I trust him to take care of me and you should too!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I have lived in this building for almost a year. I have watched the transition from old management to new management and I must say that there has been a great improvement in both the environment and atmosphere ever since. The members of the Charter Court team are both helpful and pleasant, especially Ms. Carla who always greets me with a smile and asks me about my day. There has been some noise due to the construction, as new windows are currently being put in, but how else can management truly improve Charter Court Apartments for the better? I think new management is doing a great job. They have changed and improved so much in the past 6 months and I can't wait to see what they have in store next :)"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"The Morris is gorgeous, inside and out! As soon as you walk in the lobby, you are greeted by the friendliest concierge in Nash, Jules! Stop by the office and say hi to the leasing team, they are awesome! The apartments are insanely pretty and the floor to ceiling windows give each room an amazing view of the city! I'm lucky enough to face the 7th floor terrace, which is the perfect spot to hang and grill or play ping pong! So many restaurants are nearby so grabbing coffee, a happy hour drink, any kind of food or dessert is super simple. Another plus to living at The Morris is that it's dog friendly and it's location is perfect for taking my pup on long walks down Music Row or through Vandy."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"They came out the same day I called them to give me a quote and provided a fair price so we decided right then to hire them. They took care of getting the permit within just a few business days. Once we got the permit they were out just a couple of days later. They showed up on time to get the job started and Ryan and his crew worked fast. We had an Elm and Norfolk pine as well as a couple of small trees that needed to be removed, and a large oak, palm trees, and a couple of Japanese plum trees that needed trimmed. The whole crew was very polite, worked hard, and they thoroughly cleaned up all debris. I definitely recommend this company and will hire them again."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Be Aware; Read the lease VERY Carefully! 
We had a bad experience when moving in and out of the apartment.
Moving in- the apartment was not ready the day we were told. In addition, when we moved in, it was dirty, needed to be painted, and had leftover furniture on the porch. Moving out- we had stayed the entire term of our 12 month lease. 
Unlike most apartments, when the lease renews, its for another 12 months. NOT month to month! If you move out when your lease ends, you have to give a 90 day notice.
Basically, you have to know exactly when you're moving out or they keep your deposit. I gave it a 2 star because maintenance comes within the day or next day of your call- their only saving grace."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Lived under a lease with MKC Properties for a total of 3 years. Unless you sign a multi-year lease, they will raise your rent every year. Started off at out place at $1200/month, but was going to be at $1450 if we signed for a fourth year. Current management was great, but MKC owner is notorious for having absurd turnaround, so be very, very cautious.

They still managed to take money out of our security deposit for ""apartment touch ups""... which certainly never extended past normal wear and tear and even after having a walk through with management before vacating. Be cautious of Google Reviews. Current management has been great, but the building owner will likely turnover the employees very quickly. We went through 5-6 different managers during our 3 years with MKC."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Cut the tree down making a mess of my front yard. When they ground the stump, they left large pieces in the yard and threw grindings all over the place. The guys who were supposed to do the finish grade just covered over the large pieces and didn't even put any top soil on the area. It took several weeks for them to get somebody out to do the job at least marginally well. To top it all off, when I initially called for the estimate I mentioned I had a coupon I received in the mail. It was not reflected in the invoice. I called the office and they said I had to ""hand it to the estimator"" for it to be valid. So they wouldn't honor the coupon. Stay away."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Kristopher was a no-show to our appointment. This was after having me confirm multiple times (it took about a week to get an appointment with him, and his policy requires a confirmation text 2 hours prior to the appointment time).

20 minutes before we were scheduled to meet, he sent me an text about his car having been towed. I sympathized, waited a few hours, and then sent him a text asking if he was able to find his car, and if we could reschedule (I had a month to find a place, and units move quickly in Philly). Never got a response from him.

I understand that shit happens, but it is very unprofessional to not reschedule. Especially when you have a policy that is so inflexible to schedule changes on the client's end."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"We had a great experience working with Amerifence to finish off the fencing in our back yard.

The salesperson was professional and quick to give us an honest estimate. After getting two more quotes, we chose to go with Amerifence. We asked that the dirt hauling be included in our final price. 

The morning of the installation, the two men arrived on time and got to work promptly, completing the job in just two hours! Granted, it was only a small section of fence and a single gate, but I was nonetheless impressed. The custom-sized gate works well, the fence is very sturdily built, and they even fixed an old, warped section of our existing fence without being asked. 

Overall, we were impressed with the entire experience: the price, professionalism, speed, and final product."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Heating and Air Conditioning are things we all need to keep ourselves comfortable in this miserable Missouri weather.  To keep my heating & cooling equipment in tip top condition, I use Martin - Jetco.

I started out using M-J for my seasonal check-ups and when it was time to upgrade my system it was almost a no brainer. Even though I knew the end result, I still got other bids for both new heating and air conditioning. I was right, Martin - Jetco beat everyone hands down. 

I love my new system, I've experienced both seasons and have been both toasty warm and chilly cool. Of course I have them come prior to every cooling/heating season to make sure everything is performing at its best. 

Hometown biz, excellent customer service and quality work."
Home Services,3.5,OR,BEWARE: They do not honor their window tint warranty? They tell you lifetime guarantee.. but went there today because the top left corner was peeling off the window. They told me it was a tear so the it was not covered. I explained to them that I cut the peeling part off so it didn't get worse since it went up to the window frame. Didn't matter she told me I should have brought it with the peeling film because they send it to the manufacturer for evaluation??   Extremely rude people and lacking any attempt at customer satisfaction. We are under a mask mandate from the state and not one employee was wearing a mask! DO NOT GO HERE!! The tint i had put on was less than a year old..

Elliott, Chris and Shane were the 3 men that moved me and were the best movers I have ever had as well !!  I will hopefully be moving again sooner then later and will positively use Sam's Moving again as well as Elliott, Chris and Shane!!  Nobody else will do!!  I was so happy with this move that 2 of my friends will be using Sam's Movers very soon.  Thank you for making my move such a pleasant experience!!

Home Services,1.5,OR,"Another customer who wishes there was a zero star option.

Short version: Heating problem on 1 floor. Action did a bunch of diagnostics and said we needed an entire new boiler system ASAP, ours was dying, unsafe, quoted us $11,700 and up.

Second opinion quickly determined the problem was a faulty thermostat, which was fixed for a total of $220 including labor and parts. Heat now works perfectly.

Net saved by *not* using Action to solve our heating problem: $11,480. True, we do not have an entire new boiler....but we do not need one. Some day, when we actually do need a new boiler, we absolutely will not be getting it from Action.

Quick service and nice guy came out, but that is really not worth $11,480 more...especially when the second opinion was quick and nice, too."

Home Services,1.5,CG,Awful!!!!  It's 6+ weeks old and the only way to fix it is to have the person who came out and checked the dishwasher run.  The dishwasher was not working and it was causing a huge leak.  The next day they called me and said they would be coming out the next day to repair the dishwasher.  I had to call them back to come out the next day to get the new dishwasher.  They never called me back.  I had to call the office to get my money back.  I called the owner and she said she is still working on the dishwasher but will not come back to fix it

She knew just how to let our dog get to know her and gain trust. Kim, Mojo & Fam go out of their way to make it a positive and loving environment for the dogs and do the same for us fussy owners.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"I recently had Randy Rodriguez tint my 07' gt mustang.  He does stunning work at prices that others will not match. His craftsmemship leaves others in the dust, once you have Randy or any of his men do your tint you have no worries. Don't hesitate,  Mr. Rodriguez is a very nice individual,  he will answer any question you have before, and after the jobs done. Mr. Rodriguez did such good work I entrusted him with my 68' camaro to tint, I was blown away at just how amazing my 68' camaro turned out as well. Heck, I may as well have him tint my house next. Do yourself a favor, hire the best TINT man in TAMPA,  other so-called tint experts suffer by comparison.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"After our normal repair guy threw up his hands because he didn't know where to start with our refrigerator that was not keeping cold, I gave Mr. Appliance a try. The technician, Andrew, was very friendly and worked diligently to determine the potential problem. He was always professional and worked quickly. Unfortunately, our problem was multi-factorial and required a few parts to be replaced, but Andrew kept coming back and finally got the refrigerator working. The last part he installed for free. Sure it would have been nice to have it fixed with one trip, but the fact that Andrew kept coming back and actually fixed the refrigerator is a huge plus. I imagine other people would have given up. We are so happy to have a cold refrigerator again."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I can't believe I'm changing a review, however after unpacking for over a week I am finding some issues that I wasn't aware of.  They were so nice and I was in such a hurry to move I overlooked certain things.  When I mentioned the breaking of specific items at the new house, I did get an attitude of ""it's ok."". But discovering they tweeked the doors on my washing machine was the final straw.  I was never even given the chance to list damages.  With big name companies although more expensive they give you a form to note damage and a time frame to notify them of damages.  That didn't happen.  When asked they did take special care of certain items, but in retrospect, everything was special."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I feel the need to update this review. One would think after they were told not to come back to my neighborhood not to come back to our property we posted no solicitation signs that they wouldn't come back right? Wrong! They sent another solicitor today who was very chirpy and her response when I asked her why were they back and she said ""we come back every year""

If you research them the reviews are still not good for them for the most part and if you research them you will also see they keep repeat soliciting and addresses who are not only posted no solicitation, but whoever asked them specifically to put them on a do not solicit list.

This company does not respect customers or potential customers. It's just about churning the sales."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I called US Inspect on Monday after getting a recommendation from Talk to Tucker Home services and spoke to Ric, the manager. Ric picked up right away and was very personable and friendly. He asked if we are first time home buyers - which we are - and took the time to help explain things a little bit further.. termite, radon testing and etc... I was able to go online and schedule an appointment for the next day with their Senior Inspector John Burns. He arrived early with a mentee, Jeremy. They were very thorough and explained different things throughout the process. They have a 100 day guarantee and got the inspection report to me via email on the same day! I would highly recommend them to others looking for a quality home inspection."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"A little disappointed because I heard such great things. The staff was very nice and the salon is really clean and cute. But the organic 8hour set tan itself was not what I hoped. I'm very fair, like as white as it gets, so I explained clearly I wanted a subtle, light tan. They suggested a 3-4 because anything else would be underwhelming. Im wishing I got like a 1-2. But I sorta did, on just one arm. Parts of me are a good color. But my legs are sooo much darker then the rest of me. There's a lot of build up between my boobs, around my armpit, ankles, knees. She didn't spray my feet at all.

They said it would be another 24 hours. Fine, at this point I just needed it done. Thursday someone is suppose to come, and then I get a call that the guy didn't have the right equipment and that it had to be ANOTHER 24 hours. Meanwhile my basement is flooding with sewage. I would NEVER call them again. Absolutely HORRIBLE company. The lady that answers the phone is literally useless."

The actual apts are clean, nice. not the most modern, but not old by any means. carpeted and well lit. the hallways are wide and everyone i encountered who lived there was super nice.

security was also super understanding and very nice.

They came out same day, were very knowledgeable and luckily the issue turned out to be not too serious, so the cost was very reasonable.

Unfortunately, my property manager dispatched them to resolve my issue, only to be charged an absurd premium for a simple cable & jet service (something a 10 year old could accomplish). Additionally, the plumber either did not care, or did not have the skill set  to completely free the drain of grease because I still am experiencing issues. I think this time around I will teach my 8 year old brother how to spray high pressure water down the drain rather than give CODE BLUE PLUMBING hundreds of dollars for not even completing a simple task.

They were slightly tricky to contact and also quite late each time arriving hours after the arrival window.  And they were not particularly apologetic about it.  The lack of value of my time (or the person that was there) was extremely bothersome.

I had a horrific time explaining that some work had been completed to their phone answer lady.  I provided details at least 3 times and I'm still not certain that she understood.  That was a tad frustrating.

The plumber that they sent over, Jesse, was great.  He dod fkne work rather quickly and was very personable.  Weeks later everything is working better than when I moved i to thr place years ago."

The front desk is very busy, and there are a lot of people with family members in the office. I would suggest you stay away from this place. The staff is always a bit rude, and the most common complaint is that the office staff doesn't really care about your concerns or the security of your belongings. The only reason I have a good experience with this place is because of the young couple who were there. I moved in last year, and I was very happy with the apartment.

At 9:30am I got a call saying they would be closer to the end time of 11am and would call 1/2 in advance to let me know they were on their way. I called at noon because I hadn't heard from them and now they made excuses and said they could be there at 2pm. I wasted my entire day waiting for them. No respect for my time whatsoever. I called a different company after reading the reviews. They are coming out tomorrow between 8-9am and assured me they would be on time. I got Suncoasts name from Home Depot and I intend on writing a review there so no one else has to waste their time. Read all the reviews before doing biz with Suncoast.

She was very thorough and straight forward. The price of the window was also very comparable to other places. I feel like we got a great deal with a great warranty. The window does take a bit to make, roughly 6 weeks.

Installation was today. The guys showed up on time as stated. All 3 men introduced themselves, they were nice and respectful. They did a great job with the install and cleaned up after. Not just sweeping but vacuuming. The customer service here is some of the best. If you need windows or doors this is the place to go. I will continue to support this small business."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"We would strongly recommend against using this company to clean your carpets. We are currently re-cleaning ours because after they were cleaned by Sunshine Cleaning they were worse. A black, oily residue gets on our feet and shoes since they ""cleaned"" them and it looks awful on our light colored carpet and shows more as the weeks have gone by. It took a few days for the carpets to dry. Our wood stairs have nicks caused by the person dragging his equipment down the stairs. The cat urine smell was mostly gone after the cleaning but that was not worth the negatives. We are not the type to argue or complain so we paid him but are angry and disappointed and don't want others to have this horrible experience."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Efficient, courteous, friendly, accommodating, prompt in setting up quick appt. for pick-up, I can go on and on.  I just had Issic and Brent from the Reno location come out to our lake cabin.  They called first to give approximate time for arrival and were spot on and were amazing in everyway. They worked quickly and went on their way to the next pick up,  I have used this service before elsewhere and will continue to use them again!  5 star service for these guys and the Reno location. Big plus is that they do donate your items if they are in good condition which mine were.  So they will give to a non-profit and then send me the receipt.  It can't get much better than that!!  Thanks guys!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"So...we had them pump our septic which to our knowledge went well.  Unfortunately, the driver of the truck hit our gate and caused damage that needed repair.  He was unaware of the fact he hit the fence, I guess it is difficult to feel in such a big truck.  When we mentioned it to him he contacted his boss and we all took pictures of the damage.  The company called the next day and the ball was in motion to fix our gate.  They sent a repair man that works for their company and it was fixed and fixed well.  I understand that accidents happen but I appreciate the fact they took full responsibility and fixed the problem quickly and professionally.  I will use this company in the future!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,One of the worst places i have lived. The area is nice but the people who run the buildings have terrible communication skills they never get back to you. Issues in the building take extremely long to resolve. We have had leaks coming from the air vent damaging everything underneath it with little help from the managers. We also have had mice that took 2 months to get someone out to even begin taking care of. The managers are not very kind when there are problems at hand they are very ride at times. Ive also called the corporate offices with no return call from them. Im also moving out soon and seam to be neglected for those reasons. Look elsewhere folks and save some money this place is way more expensive then it is worth.
Home Services,1.0,OR,THE worst place to live! All the landlord does is harrass! Her name is shanisha! Literally a horrible person!  Tries to charge you for things to get fixed and pay a pet deposit when you dont even have a dog! Just to get money out of you! Doesnt give notices when they are doing work...meaning they wont let us know when there wont be hot water or when they are doing LOUD work on the roof! Literally the worst place ever. Nothing close to feeling at home.  When I moved in the place was a mess! The bathroom was sooooo dirty and the carpets smelled disgusting and since we signed the lease she said there wasnt backing out! The worst decision to move here. And they have the worst insect problem. I hate it.
Home Services,1.5,CG,"I signed up for service and it took me about 15 minutes to get my furnace installed.  The other two guys had to get a hold of the technician and he had to say ""oh, we need to call him back"".  The technician told me he had to call me back because I was calling them with a different phone number.  I told him I was so sorry I could not do that.  I asked him if he could get me an estimate on a new furnace and he said he would call me back.  I called the other two guys who said they could not get me an estimate on a new furnace because they had already left.  I asked why they"
Home Services,4.5,CG,They were a bit on the pricey side as well. I will definitely be using them again and will definitely be using them again.I had a very bad experience with this company.  We had a valve issue with our heater which was fixed within two days.  I called them for a quote and they sent me a quote and they did the same thing on the same day.  They did a great job!  I was happy to go with them and will definitely use them again.  They are very professional and the price is very fair.  I would highly recommend them.I had a great experience with GotoGator.  They were very professional and did a fantastic
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Absolutely the worst property for a realtor. 

We lived in a complex for 4 years and had an excellent experience. The office staff is very professional, courteous and nice. They had no issues in the past, they were very responsive and always communicated well. The office staff was very friendly and helpful. 

I would recommend them to anyone looking for a realtor.This company has been a pleasure to work with. I have a hard time finding a service that is friendly, professional, and quick.  I know that I have a lot of time on my hands, but this is definitely a different story.  I can't say enough about how"
Home Services,4.5,CG,"We had Groutsmith come out and do the job and they did a great job. I would recommend them to anyone. 

I will definitely use them again if I have any other needs.I had a great experience with your service. I had a gas leak that was coming from the drain. I called with a quote and they came out to fix it. I was very impressed. They were professional, courteous, and extremely helpful. I will definitely use them again.I had a leak in my garage that needed to be cleaned out. I called Home Depot and they were very prompt, and provided a quote that was very reasonable. I would highly recommend them"
Home Services,1.0,CG,"It's been over a year since I've ever paid a mortgage, and my credit score has not been growing. I had to get a hold of the lender to get a hold of me. After a month of waiting, I called a number of other lenders and got a call back from the BBB. I was told the BBB would not be able to help me until I paid the loan. I had to pay a claim and get a hold of the lender to get a hold of me. I got a hold of the lender, but they refused to answer my phone call. When I finally got a hold of the lender, they said they would not do anything to help"
Home Services,1.5,CG,"The two stars are not enough. The guys at the front desk are also rude and rude. The owner is not very nice. The office staff is the worst. I have been dealing with this company for over a year. I am extremely disappointed.I had an excellent experience with the Plumbing Company. They have been the most professional, courteous and responsive to my needs. They have always made sure to take care of my plumbing needs and I have always been very satisfied. They are very friendly, helpful and prompt. They will do anything to help you with your plumbing needs. They are always there to answer any questions you may have. I would highly recommend Plumbing Company"
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Amazing experience! 

I have moved here a couple of times and I will definitely be using this company again. I had an issue with the fence. The fence was not fixed. The guy that came to fix it said it was a ""twist"". He said it would be $100 a piece. I said it would be $300 and he said it was $110. I said, ""What?""  He said it was $200 a piece and he said it was $100. I said, ""I'll pay you $50 a piece"". He said he had to do it for $100."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"This was the first time I used 'Request a Quote' on yelp.  I posted that I needed a couple of trees trimmed and got a response in less than an hour.  We talked on the phone, I texted a picture of my tree, and setup an appointment for a quote the next day.  He walked my yard and had quote immediately.  The next day, he performed the work while I was at work, texting me pictures of the finished product.

As you can see for from the photos, he did an amazing job on my most troublesome tree.  The others were small trim jobs to keep them off of the roof.  If you need this kind of work done, you can't go wrong with this business, very professional, quick, and quality work."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"First off, I did not hire them. Part of the reason was after a month of people cancelling appointments, not being available and flat out being flakes, I NEVER saw an estimate, or rendering. The owner called me to apologize for all the unreturned calls and miss communications, and to tell me their contractors are very busy and the BEST, I decided to give them a fair chance. Then their designer, Megan, tells me the contractor thought I was rude (which I absolutely not) when he was the only one who showed up TWO WEEKS after the original commit date. My feeling is this company lacks customer service AND integrity and I have cit my losses and moved on to a more local company who doesn't think Carson City is too far away for them to go."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"We just had 2 area rugs cleaned by ChemDry of Hillsborough County today. The results were amazing!  They use a specialized solution that kills bacteria in your rug and even have a solution that works on pet urine. Since they don't use traditional methods which use water and make your rugs and carpet very wet -- they were dry within in an hour of them leaving.  The carpets look brand new!  Seth and Jake were early for their appointment, personable, knowledgeable and professional.  They worked neatly and efficiently and were able to answer all of our questions. In addition to the quality of their work and their professional demeanor their pricing was reasonable and fair. The whole experience was stress free and I would highly recommend them.  Thank you Seth and Jake!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"While planning a move from South Orange, NJ to Philadelphia, the proprietor, Rob, could not have been more helpful. Besides being totally honest, upfront and forthcoming with information, he was generous and very helpful. We're moving a grand piano and sofas to the second floor. He expertly explained that a scissor lift is ideal. Rob also provided a link to reserve parking for the move.  At this time, SafeGuard Moving does not offer storage as part of the process, but I understand this is changing soon. As a result, we were not able to use Rob. Most unfortunate!!! Rob provided all this information and spoke to me many times, without me being a customer! Should our plans change, I'll will contact him immediately. If you're moving to or from Philly, you must give Rob a call!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,In my other review of Window World everything been great. We have had 11 window put in and never had had an issue until now. We order 6 more windows and was schedule to put in 10-13 they called us and said they had an opening for Saturday10-8 we took the appointment because that way we did not have to take off work. We were going to miss a football game we were planning to go to but thought if they came early we could still make the game a little late but that was ok because I was getting my windows in.  Guess what they did not come or call.  If they at least of called we could of still made our plans.  Our time is just as valuable as there. Really disappointing.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Benjamin from Magnolia came out for a home inspection. The house is perfect for us but because it is older we had some concerns going in as the potential buyers. Benjamin was very thorough, taking us step by step through what he found. He patiently answered a long list of questions and walked us around to specific problem areas. He also allowed us to take our time walking around the property. Because we are first-time home buyers, we really appreciated his willingness to cover the kinds of questions we had. In the end, we felt much more confident in our purchase because of the information Benjamin provided. He even promptly answered follow up calls and text messages when we were in a time-crunch. We would highly recommend Magnolia and Benjamin to friends and family for home inspections."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Everything done same day. We wanted to re-key our garage entry to match our front door. Not as simple as we hoped for technical reasons, but they explained what needed to be done and helped us find a way to fit it in our budget. Went back to the shop for some parts, came back and finished the work quickly. Everything works exactly as we wanted it! 

5 stars for the actual tech who came to the house; 4 stars for the office staff. I put in a quote request online and received three separate phone calls, none of whom knew that we had already been called, and not all said the same thing regarding estimates and prices. Very happy with what we did, but almost didn't use this company as a result of the phone calls!"
Home Services,4.0,CG,"My basement flooded. I had to leave the garage door open for a couple of days. I called the owner and told him I would be out of town the next morning. He said it was just a matter of time. I said, ""I'm going to call the police."" He said he would call the police. I called them the next day and they said they had already called me and had not heard anything. I called the manager. He told me that I would have to call the police again. I told him I would call the police again and he said ""well, why don't you just call the police?"" I was still not satisfied. I called the owner and"
Home Services,4.5,CG,"Great customer service, we are happy with the quality and quality of our work!We have been using the BEST Moving services in the Philadelphia area for the past 3 years.  They were reliable, professional, and friendly.  They were able to move us around and to some extent had the best price.  They also came out and did a great job of cleaning our garage.  They were very responsive and had all the necessary equipment and tools.  I will definitely use them again!We had a very nice young couple come out to our house, they were very nice and professional. We had a couple of issues with the kitchen sink and it was only after we gave them a chance"
Home Services,2.5,CG,"I NEVER EVER do reviews, but I thought it would be a good idea to do so. I had a friend, who lives in the area, who was very nice and helpful. He said he was working on a new roofing company and that the roofing company could come to the house and install the roof and repair it. He was very friendly and pleasant to deal with and provided a quote for a quote. I had him come back the next day, and he did not charge me any extra. The roofing company that came was a very nice company."
Home Services,4.5,CG,This rating is based off of an estimate by the owner of the property who provided the estimate and we had an estimate the following day. He then provided a quote on a 4 hour work day and completed it on a Friday. The previous owner had provided an estimate on a Saturday and no call to schedule a time to complete the work. The estimate was received on a Saturday. We were told the estimate would be completed on Monday and no call to schedule a time. The owner of the property gave the estimate on a Sunday and no call to schedule a time. We are told that the work is done on Monday and no call to schedule a time.
Home Services,4.5,CG,"I had a leak under my bathtub and the pool was full. I called the local store and they said they had a leak, but they said the leak was not a leak and that it was a leak.

I called the manager and he told me I had to call him first. I called the manager again and he said they had a leak, but he said that was just a leak and he had to call him first.

Home Services,4.0,CG,"The view is nice, but it's not the best. I will admit that my apartment was pretty damn nice before we moved in. The office staff is awful and the apartments are very large. If you want to live in a large apartment, you have to be prepared to deal with staff with no respect. I have to constantly leave things in the apartments and they are always so busy. They make you feel like you are not there and that they don't care about you. I have to leave items in the apartment because the staff is too busy to deal with it. They just sit on their phones and nothing happens. I have to go to the apartment to get things to get moved"
Home Services,4.0,CG,Chapman has serviced my company for over 20 years and has been a true professional. I would recommend him highly.I had a house inspection done by the HVAC company.  The inspector came out and told me that the water heater was working fine.  He stated that they would call me back if I needed to do anything.  I called the office to speak to him.  He was very nice and pleasant to deal with.  He told me that I would have to call him back to get my house inspected.  I called the office and was told that I had a problem with the heater.  I called back and was told that they would call me
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Unprofessional. 

I called Tuesday night around 11:30 pm to get a key extraction, along with a replacement key. Stephanie told me that my appointment would be the next morning at 11:30 am, Wednesday, June 2. 

I waited around all day. I was called by 11:28 by Angel and he told me that he was caught up at another job and he would be there ASAP. That never came. I called, left messages and no one called back. I called another locksmith company , America's locksmith. Got it taken care of within 1 hour. 

I just received a call back from Pop-A-Lock this morning-Thursday, June 3. It was Stephanie stating that my appointment was today, as if yesterday NEVER HAPPENED! I've attached a screenshot, proving that the tech was aware of our appointment yesterday. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"DONOT book with this company , supervisor (Jennifer) so rude, with a bad attitude toward customer. Prices quoted with you Will never the same .  I was quoted for moving 1 bedroom apt in the amount of $1150 . But when they come and pick up my stuffs they just pack n load n did not say anything . After 1 hr everything got loaded to the truck .

So crazy they just want to raise the prices and charged you whatever they want. UNBELIEVABLE . Do not book with A1A movers company"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"We've had All-American's pest control service for a few years now, and they've been great.  I decided to take the time to write a review, because it's becoming more apparent to me, how crooked and ineffective so many companies in the service industry are.  We so frequently hear all the bad reviews about companies and I think it's important to send praise for the good ones.  All-American's technicians have all been professional, friendly and knowledeable.  Their office staff are the same. They are quick to respond and have always helped us with our wide and varied creepy crawler concerns.  It's refreshing.  I would absolutely recommend this company.  I have no idea how their prices stack up to the competition, but I will give my business to a trust-worthy company any day."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"We worked with Alex Roman as a buyer's realtor and it was a good experience all around.  Alex was very knowledgeable about the purchasing process and all of the different facets involved.  After some mixed messages were received regarding an HOA pet policy, she was meticulous in making sure our 3 dogs would be allowed at a property we put an offer in on.  She also worked hard to help deal with some unreasonable demands that our lender made.  In the middle of the whole process, the COVID-19 pandemic issues arose and despite the craziness of the world, Alex kept everything on track and we closed on the date originally planned for.  I would recommend Alex if you are in need of a realtor who will advocate for your needs as a buyer."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I have lived at Georgetown Apartments for 3 years now, and the amount of negative reviews they have received on here is shocking. The staff has been more than kind and professional each time I have spoken to them. Maintenance is prompt and while the apartments are older, they are comfortable, safe and worth the price you pay. 

The last few months since moving from an apartment into one of their town homes, we have had a few issues. Including bugs and the shower not working. They have handled these issues well and have made us feel like a priority. Specifically Crystal and Josh have been more than helpful and a pleasure to deal with. So thank you Georgetown. I don't think you get enough credit for the positive things this apartment complex has to offer this community."
Home Services,1.5,OR,I had cable and internet for about 7 years.    2 years ago I called to cancel the cable but kept the internet.  No problem......   called to cancel the Internet this time and I got a bill for $165 cancellation fee.   They said I got that because I cancelled before their contract was up.  I had been with them a total of 7 years and apparently the contract for the internet alone started it over again therefore I had to pay a cancellation fee.   I think that's bullshit.....   I can't get out of it even after talking to a supervisor.   I wish when I cancelled the lady on the phone would of told me that instead of just getting a bill in the mail.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"A backed-up basement sewer drain is no joke. Thank goodness I checked Yelp reviews before I called someone else, because I found a gem with Able Rooter! 

At 7:30 am, I was surprised to get a real person on the other end of the line. Tom was able to work me in to his busy day, texted me when to expect him, showed up 30 minutes early, and was finished fixing the problem in less than an hour. A routine fix at what I consider a very fair price. Good communication is the sign of a great business in my book and Able Rooter excels at it. Tom even texted me to thank me for my business when he left. I hope I don't need them again, but if I do, they are the company for me."
Home Services,3.0,CG,"I originally lived here for a year and a half. I had a lot of problems with the management. There was a lot of noise throughout the complex, and the apartments were very large. I was told by the manager that I would have to move out and that I would have to pay rent. I did not. I did not want to be the one to live here. I will never live here again. I highly recommend this property.I was very pleased with the quality of service and professionalism of this company. I would definitely recommend them to anyone. 

I had a difficult time finding a good realtor that was willing to take the time to explain to me how they came"
Home Services,3.5,CG,"When replacing my garbage disposal, I had an issue with the water pressure that my furnace ran off. I called Bowery and asked if they could come out to assess the issue and they did. When I called them back, they were very helpful. I will be using them again for my next cleaning.

I would recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable, reliable cleaning service.I went with them for a few items and they did a great job. I had a very small problem with the cable that the house had, but they did an amazing job. I was very pleased with their service and will definitely use them again.I've used them twice to get a new ceiling"
Home Services,2.0,CG,From the beginning the rental was an easy move and they did a great job. I would recommend them to anyone. From the start they have been great to work with and were very responsive. They have a very large pool and gym area so you can have a great workout. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great apartment. I will say I have had a very bad experience with the A/C unit at the very beginning. The technician did a great job cleaning the unit. I called the owner and she was very nice and answered my questions. I am glad I called A/C and would not hesitate to call them again.
Home Services,4.0,CG,"I hired Jim to remove some of the paint on my carpet.  He did a thorough job.  He was very thorough.  He took the time to explain the process and made sure it was completed in a timely manner.  The carpet was then placed on my new carpet.  Jim was very professional and quick to respond to any questions I had.  I will definitely be using him again for my new carpet.  I highly recommend Jim.I moved from New Orleans to San Francisco last weekend. I'm not sure if I've ever lived in a better place, but I'm glad I did.  I have used many different companies in the past, but this is the first"
Home Services,4.0,CG,"Seriously, better than I expected. We had the worst experience. I emailed her yesterday and she said she would call me back the next day, but since she said she didn't, I sent her an email. 

We called her again today and she said she would call me back the next day. I was also told that she would call me back on Monday to check if the plumbing was working properly. 

This is the second time I have had problems with this company. 

I've been using this company for over a year and it has never been worse. 

They have a good customer service team, but when you have a customer service company"
Home Services,5.0,CG,"Billy was incredible! Not only was he professional and knowledgeable in all areas of my home, but he was also extremely prompt and accommodating. He was also very knowledgeable and honest in answering any questions that I had. He was also extremely knowledgeable about the materials used to make our home look and feel great. He was very professional and knowledgeable about our items and our needs. I highly recommend him to anyone needing a home or furniture restoration!I called Plumbing a few days ago to have a leak in my shower. The plumber was very nice and professional. I was able to call and speak with him quickly. I have used him a couple of times in the past."
Home Services,3.5,CG,"I recently received an estimate from an electrician and they said they would charge me the estimate and we would be fine. The technician, Eric, then said we needed to call him again to come out and look at the problem. The technician told me he had to call me back the next day to come out to the house and tell me how the problem was resolved. I called Eric and was told he would not be there. The next day he arrived and said he was going to check the system for a few hours. I called Eric and was told he was here a little while later and would be there that day. Eric was not there that day."
Home Services,5.0,CG,"After two moves in less than an hour, we decided to move back in just in time for the new year.  The house was maintained and the windows were clean.  The movers were very professional and helpful.  I would highly recommend them.

The property management is friendly and professional, very accommodating, and the staff is very helpful.  The property management staff is very helpful and helpful.  The property is beautiful, and the property is well maintained.  The staff is great and the property is very quiet"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"David was the only plumbing service in town that answered the phone on a Sunday evening. He was prompt, thorough, and honest. After an inspection and initial attempt, he got us draining again so we could at least not be afraid to flush. There was more work to do (roots) so he gave us our options and worked with our landlord (property management) to get approval for the work. He was back the next morning to finish the job.

This was dirty work for a Sunday evening. I appreciate a plumber that isn't afraid to dive right in and comes out with options for his customer. When we buy a house, Dave will be the first one I call for maintainence and service. If I was a property manager, I would get Dave on my accounts. Reasonable, honest, and experienced."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Our hard drive crashed and we lost most of our photos and videos from a few years. I was so sad to think about all the videos and pictures of our kids learning to walk and talk that were lost.  We took it to one place that said they were unrecoverable.  Another lady we called wanted thousands of dollars to try to get the information.  Then we found Geeks 2 You!!!!!!  They were very reasonably priced and said they have a 95% data recovery success rate.  Teresa worked on our hard drive and was able to recover everything!!!!!   I'm so happy with the work they did.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Thanks Geeks 2 You for being honest, reasonable, and hard working.  So glad to have my files back!!!!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Justin did a fantastic job in selling our house. I initially wanted to sell my house alone because of everything available to homeowners online and knowing that I would be a difficult client to please. Justin instead showed me why it would be beneficial to use an agent and he was completely right. He was persistent in making sure all of the contracts were correct and followed yet flexible when I requested to help make the deal close swallowing his pride when the buyer was wrong. He calculated the whole process doing every that needed to be done to make the difficult arrangement happen. I would recommend him for any and all of your real estate transactions. Not only is he professional but he also has so many qualities I like in a person, being honest, ethical and nice."
Home Services,1.0,OR,Scam. I called Adt to reactivate my alarm. I didn't know I had a third party until I called to move and was told by Adt that I had to call defenders because they had my contract. Then everything made sense now about the install. First they lied about the price then the guy lied that my equipment couldn't be activated even though it was ADT pulse equipment. Then he said my sensors weren't compatible and sold me a brand new system i did not need. He didn't leave a delay on the alarm. The app works half of the time. So half the time the alarm sounds when you go into a house. They want to charge $100 an hour for someone to come out and put a time delay on the alarm. Anyone have any luck cancelin
Home Services,5.0,OR,I can not express my gratitude enough to Andrea and her team of superb agents during the process of selling my Boise home. Finding a real estate agent is no easy task but Andrea is truly a godsend and exceeded my expectations. If there was a rating higher than 5 stars she deserves it. She went above and beyond the call of duty and made this transition smooth and stress free for my husband and I helping us through every step of the process. I can not even find the words to describe her attention to detail and care when handling our home in our absence as we moved out of state during the process. If you are looking for a real estate agent you can trust and one that has your best interest at heart look no further!
Home Services,3.5,OR,"College Hunks were a mixed bag - the movers themselves were on time and very friendly. They helped us sort a few difficult-to-box items and quickly load the truck. They did end up dropping a box while stacking three at a time to carry, which seemed unnecessary. We were discounted a part of the fee (around $40 out of the $430+ they charged for the service) and told the items within would be replaced, but this never happened. We were ultimately told it was because we didn't pay them to pack for us. I would understand that if the items had broken in the course of normal moving but it is really unreasonable given that the box was dropped several feet because of their recklessness. I'd only recommend using them if you can't find someone else to move you."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"They are inconsistent with garbage pickup.  This is the second day in a row they didn't collect garbage.  I talked with them yesterday and woke up today to discover they skipped my apt again.  I am suppose to hear from a district or regional manager today,I doubt it will happen.  Worst service ever.  I am paying to have my garbage picked up and yet I have to do it myself and they just don't care.  I dont care if the regional or district manager has to pick it up,I'm not doing it myself again.  I'm on the third floor and they are too lazy to go up the stairs.  They collected from the first two floors for the last two days and skipped the third floor two days in a row."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Having had no success with several other area plumbers for a leaky Roman tub faucet, Richard at Jolly Rooter referred me to Mike for help. Mike was able to quickly diagnose the issue and knew exactly what to do in order to fix it. He went, what I feel, was above and beyond to fit me into his schedule. With no trouble at all he was able to swap out the defective cartridges in my faucet and the whole thing was good as new. 

Mike was prompt, personable (we had several hobbies in common and it was nice talking to him), knowledgeable, and his rates were very reasonable. While I hope I don't see Mike very often because I like not having plumbing issues, I will be using Mansfield Plumbing again when issues arise because this experience was flawless."

Home Services,1.0,CG,DISASTER AVOIDED! I was originally told by the owner that they would be back for a fix but he never showed up. The owner then said that they would be there when he was scheduled but it was too late. I called a number of other companies and they still did not show up. I called a few other companies and they were all right on their way. After a month I called again and they were still not on their way. I called another company and they still did not show up. I called another company again and they still did not show up. I called another company and they still did not show up.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"We went to Avalon two weeks ago very early on a Saturday morning around 8:30am and as always we brought our 4 year old Pug with us. The store manager told us that the store does not allow dogs/pets and they have no insurance.  I offer to pick our dog up and hold on to him but still this was not good enough for the store manager. After infuriating us, we left and will never return. I have been to the Philly Avalon show room and have not had this experience. So, we drove to Ideal tile and had a great experience and will buy all of our floor  tile and counter slabs from them for our renovation project. This guy at the Cherry Hill location should be fired. He was not customer friendly and tarnished Avalon's reputation."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Simply the best.  A totally stress free experience.  I was getting rid of a piano that could no longer hold a tuning, and getting a new (to me) 1998 Yamaha 48"" upright.  From my first call to the office through removal of the old piano with delivery of the Yamaha, everyone was wonderful.  I couldn't have them deliver the piano on Friday because I had a scheduling conflict.  They cheerfully offered to hold it over the Memorial Day weekend and delivered it on Tuesday.  Carrie in the office is terrific, her moving crew is courteous, kind, and cheerful.   And, this family-run and owned  business has a friend whose hobby is making furniture out of the wood of unplayable pianos, so you don't feel quite so bad about ""executing"" your old piano."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"First of all, had to deal with Mitch, was treated very rudely.  Was told because of where I lived, it would cost me more money for installation of garage door.  He sent an apology email.  We went in, paid 1/2 for a garage door which Mitch said to us in writing 4 to 6 weeks.  Called on the sixth week, called on Tuesday was told by Melody that the truck would be in on Thursday and that she would get with scheduler and call me back, no phone call until Thursday, was told truck was not coming in could not give a date.  I asked to speak with manager, no manager but Randy stated again, could not tell me when door would be in.  Asked for a refund and now sitting waiting for that."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"The apartment complex I just left asked me to get my carpets cleaned upon moving out, and while I was irritated by that at first (not the fault of the cleaners of course), I had a great experience with Regal! When I called they were polite and helpful, and it was overall a very simple process. They had tons of time slots available so I had no problem scheduling a time that worked for me.

Since I wasn't going to be home at the time they came to clean the carpets, they allowed me to leave cash on the counter for the cleaners who came. It was only $48 for my one bedroom apartment which I thought was a pretty good deal. When I came back the next day the carpets were cleaned wonderfully! I have no complaints about this company!"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Overall the quality of work and efficiency on the day of the job were great. Getting scheduled was a bit of back and forth with the front office, but for an estimate that was significantly cheaper than other companies I am not complaining. They were always upfront and weren't trying to stall or cover up any mistake in scheduling. They legitimately had some hiccups on getting all the parts. The only reasons for 4 stars was the back and forth for scheduling, and I was told one more thing needed to be checked and I would be contacted for that. I wasn't contacted so I eventually contacted them and got that scheduled. The central AC they installed works incredibly well and we have had no issues. We really use our AC in the summer and it's holding up very well!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I stayed here this past weekend at a friends apartment. We are all 40 plus ""professional adults"" and we were harassed by 3 women at the desk downstairs by the  entrance door. Especially by a little blonde and a red head with a bad color. They were asking us who we were, asking for ID and accusing us of renting, etc. They even had the audacity to knock on our door and again start asking us questions on who we knew and if we rented from a website. We continually told them our friend owned the apartment and we were using it for the weekend. We finally had to call our friend to call these incredibly rude unpleasant 3 women so they would stop harassing us. I would recommend buying elsewhere our friend said they harass all the tenants!!!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,I haven't been to all that many U-Haul locations as I have been residing in the same neighborhood for the past 20 years but service at this location has improved since the new manager (Michael O'Hare I think his name is) took over a bit ago.  I used to hate waiting for inordinate amounts of time just to buy some boxes but the service has gotten faster and smoother.  There are some places where you can access your storage unit 24/7 but this isn't one of them.  The elevator has been in working order every time we've gone.  I have rented trucks maybe four times over the past two years for various projects and haven't had any hair-pulling experiences.  Maybe my expectations are low when it comes to U-Haul but I think they are A-OK.

She also made it very easy for us to schedule appointments and to get our information with a good estimate.

I had a home warranty issue that resulted in having to replace my HVAC unit and did NOT care for the service from original company that came out. I looked around and found Sunset Cooling with amazing reviews and thought I would give them a try.
Tom arrived in about 30mins!!! He gave us a GREAT price and ended up doing a brand new split unit plus lots of new duct work. Extremely polite, professional, and reliable. 
I seriously cannot say enough great things and would highly recommend him for anyone looking for that lost art of old school customer service. 
The price, the service, the warranty are all amazing. Kudos for Sunset Cooling for doing it right from the start and setting the example for how things like this should be handled."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"This is by far the worst Title Company in the whole country. Sloppy with the numbers, will never pick up the phone and just sub par performance all around. After 2 months after closing, I receive a letter from the home insurance company that my annual premium has not been paid (collected at closing). In addition they collected funds to pay off a CITIBANK credit card, which also they magically forgot to pay off. It's been nearly 3 months since I've closed and the items above has still not been resolved. Look at the other reviews and ask your self if this is the type of incompetence you want to deal with for the biggest purchase of your life. I've worked with sub par and incompetent firms before, TITLE FORWARD  wins the gold medal. Stay far away, DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I had 60 days to find a home in Florida or move back to Louisiana. I'm sure my situation wasn't typical but Mike approached it with zeal. As a first time home owner he could've taken advantage about my vast lack of knowledge. He never did. He constantly answered all my questions honestly and readily. He showed me houses above and below my price point so I could determine what was valuable to me. He encouraged me when I was overwhelmed and wanted to quit. Seriously houses were going under contract while we were on the properties. It was a wild crazy journey but because of his spirit, persistence, and determination we closed my first home on day 61. He truly is an amazing human and realtor. Please triple his salary. You seriously get 3 employees in just that one guy."

I find the food very, very good for a la carte dining at a golf club, way different from many clubs I know whose names I will keep to myself. ah-hem. At most clubs, their banquet food and buffet food is better than ordering from menu, but not here, a very pleasant surprise. Consistency in quality and prep from each visit, excellent service at the bar, and a very tastefully decorated bar area and dining room. There is nothing I ordered over this time period that I wish I hadn't or was less than 3 to 5 star range. Now I only wish the friggin' golf course was as good as the food."

Matt Pillsbury was perfection - he returned my message within an hour or two with appointment times and a quote and was more reasonably priced than any other house inspection company that I found. He was very prompt. He was here for a few hours and was very thorough. He informed me of everything that needed to be done in a way that I could understand (I have no clue when it comes to this stuff), in addition to it being in the report. He gave me directions with next steps to fix the problem areas, which is great because I would've had no idea where to begin. He was super friendly and fun to chat with.

She applied, plaid the application and was accepted 6 months prior to move in. 2 weeks later she called and asked to withdraw her application. Two months after that they called her and said she was still responsible for the lease and that she's signed the lease online....again she/we thought it was just the application paperwork. We asked how to get out of the lease (could we pay a fee). They said no and then only way was to sell her lease. She sold her lease later that day and then they charged her $359 to sign over the lease (again now 4 mo this before move in). Anyway I fee this is just bad business and a sad way to screw college students who barely have money:-("
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I am active duty military stationed overseas.  My tenants informed me that my roof was leaking.  I did my research and Drew Roofing seemed great, so I contacted them.  They emailed me back immediately and were out in a few days (apparently it was raining for several days straight) to give me an estimate.  When they were there they found that a nail lifted one of the shingles, causing the leak.  They fixed it in a few minutes for free!

It's a rare thing to have this sort of experience with a company these days.  They could have taken advantage of us being overseas, but they didn't, instead they were honest and incredibly helpful!

When the time comes that I need roof repair or a new roof I will be going to Drew Roofing Company!

I highly recommend them!"

Home Services,4.0,OR,"I had a leak in two of my skylights. I called Skylights Specialists and Mr Elias came out and was very knowledgeable and pinpointed the problem right away. I had my flat roof recoated by Wild West Painting back in April ( whom we called back twice, with no results) They had covered the weepholes with roof coating, so that the skylights could not drain off which caused the skylights to leak. He suggested removing the skylights to repair them and wrote us an estimate which I was surprised at how affordable it was. He also recommended redoing a low spot and 2 seams that were left by WWP. He was able to do the job and replaced all three skylights and fixed the problems that WWP had created. Very professional job and 2 days labor and materials only cost us $700."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Thank you Mr. Electric! After hiring Mr. Electric my faith in contractors is renewed.

Mr. Electric was easy to hire and did the work. It's a chain that operates across North America but they seemed to want our business, and want to help, more than any of the local electricians we called.

We've had a hard time getting an electrician to even come look at some of our minor repairs. Mr. Electric not only set up an appointment, they were here exactly on time and the electrician took just a few minutes to disconnect some wiring. 10 minutes of work for more than $100. I can't believe nobody local, and independent, wanted that kind of job.

These guys will be at the top of my contractor list.

As an added note to potential customers, the electrician put on little booties to cover his shoes while working."

They also had all the fixings for breakfast sandwiches, which is what my bf opted for since he had to head to work. They even had paper bags that you could take your breakfast to go in! I ended up making a waffle, grabbing some hot cocoa mix, and going back to the room to have breakfast in bed. Also, you can't beat checkout being at noon! The beds were comfy enough and it was nice having a kitchenette to warm up food. I would definitely recommend this place!!"

The dispatch center called me three days later and asked if anyone had been out to service our address. They apologized and took full responsibility that our service claim ultimately fell through the cracks and that they would send someone out same day. The technician then quoted me 290 because it was after hours and on a busier day. The dispatch center tried to help by having the manager call me to see how things got mixed up. Ultimately I was told I could pay the new price, schedule a service for 3+ weeks out, or kick  rocks. At this point, my trust is gone. I wish that it would have just gone as planned."

I was never worried about payments or anything with their online service because of her.  From move in proration to move out she was great.  If asprient doesn't give her a raise they better watch out because someone will snatch her up. 

NOW for everyone else that worked for asprient was absolutely terrible.  We were told we were getting a 750 square foot apartment but we did the measurements and it's about 450.

So if you live in a apartment that uses this service and you only have a trash can for this service, then you can expect to handle your recycling on your own unless you want to buy the bags from their website.  The name of the company should just be valet trash."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT SIGN UP FOR ANY CONTRACT WITH THIS COMPANY!

Purchased a contract cap rate in October. Since then prices have fallen drastically- however we continue to be charged our maximum price. I called to inquire about why and they stated that it's not based on market, but on their ""retail"" price - which is currently $1.50 per gallon over market rate. Seems very intentional that ""retail price"" is the only undefined term in their contract.

They cited ""price of having an all-inclusive service"". This was not how it was explained during the sales call. The representative stated that if prices of oil came down, we would see savings. Now, they are saying their retail price is so far above market it would never be passed through. This is what you call a BAIT AND SWITCH. They now want a $200 termination fee."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Only reason getting two stars, is PD showed up the day he was called by our plumber,  We had not made the call, and were surprised when he said he was on his way. 
On arrival started taking pictures, did not take any moisture measurements.  Said had to start working today, as mold was already developing.  Was told water had to be shut off, and it would take 3-4 days for everything to dry out,  Next words out of his mouth, were I need a $500 deposit!
I felt very uncomfortable, even more so when during his stay I found out our insurance company had scheduled someone else.  I mentioned that to PD, and he kept saying you have the right to use anyone.
Thankfully was able to reach the insurance company, they moved up our appointment by two days."

We had to call the office in the afternoon to get a hold of him. He was very rude and unprofessional. He was also the one who said ""I have a problem with your office"" and he was rude. He tried to tell me that he didn't have a problem with me, but it was the second time he'd left. I called the office and was told ""you're a liar"". The man said he had a problem with my office and he could not tell me how to fix it."

I called several times over the phone to speak to the owner.  He was very nice and polite.  He was very friendly and professional.  He was very professional and friendly.

Home Services,3.5,CG,"beware of this company.  We have had an issue with them in the past, but this one is a completely different story.  The office staff is awful and the only reason we signed up for this is because we were unhappy with the way things are going with our lease.  The only reason we signed up for this is because we were paying $150 a month for the same services.  We were told we would be charged $15.00 a month for the same service.  We paid $80 for a service they provided, and they did not charge us for it.  We are now paying $99 for that service.  We have not been charged for anything for the service we were promised"
Home Services,1.0,CG,Worst company ever!!  We had an AC system fail in two days.  They came out the next day and fixed the problem.  We also have a TRS unit that is faulty and we have had no issues with it in a while.  This company is a joke.  I would recommend them to anyone.I hired them to repair my water heater.  They were great.  They were very professional and polite.  They did a great job.  I will definitely use them again in the future.I would give them 4 stars if I could.  They were very professional and did a great job.  They were also very kind.  We were in the middle of the hottest part

I would highly recommend them.I was very impressed with this"
Home Services,1.0,OR,"They refused to pick up my recycling because where I live is ""too dangerous"" for pick up because it's a one way street. I told them to retrieve my recycling can if they can't pick it up, but they refused to do that also. They instead insisted I put it on the other side of the street (a very busy street in downtown with no crosswalks nearby) so it's safer for them to pick it up. So it's okay to put me in danger, but not their drivers. They then refused to pick up my trash this week because it contained ""construction debris"". They're incompetent at the lowest level. Their collectors don't have to take liability for anything and service is continuously bad. Waste Management is a group of people who don't have to fear competition or market consequences for their laziness and stupidity."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Hopefully you won't ever have to deal with this, but if you're reading this it's possible you have a termite issue. If you're in a similar position I was in, you're possibly panicking and probably stressed the f$&@ out. It's cool, my man Joe's got you. First, he'll come out, check out the infestation and explain what termites are, how they operate, and how we kill them. Then, he'll get to work. Unfortunately we had a major water issue, so our termites were a lasting problem, but Joe worked with us, he came out multiple times to ensure our infestation was under control during instruction, and he even sent me on a sweet field trip to by insecticide from from a very interesting couple because he was out of town and we had a little emergency. Termites suck, but Joe rocks, trust in Joe."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"They took well over a week to process my application in the office claiming corporate was holding them up.  Funny thing is I cant see who corporate is or how to contact them via my complaint against the nasty behavior of Maribel in the front office who annoyingly called me twice then obnoxiously emailed me to rub the denial in my face. Reading other reviews I'm happy to be rejected by these people. 

Maribel pretended she couldn't open 
My pdf file then she pretended she couldnt open a word file.  Funny no ones ever had trouble in Maribels field of work opening those.  Then after forcing my friend to physically hand in papers Maribel was rude to her she then handed her an identical  pack of papers to hand out. 

Very unprofessional... where is corporate .... who owns this place??"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"We are very pleased with the work Nate did for a remodel of our basement. I was worried at first about the rate/hour and paying for an estimate, but after going through numerous other companies that proved to be unreliable and a waste of time, we focused on Mr Handyman. What became clear to us is that you are paying for a depth of knowledge, versatility and professionalism that is difficult to find for relatively smaller jobs. When challenges arose (difficult sink dimensions, cabinetry missing parts, etc), Nate knew how to work around them. He was also clearly a craftsman, taking pride in his work and ensuring it met our expectations. He was consultative throughout the process and in the end, we came in significantly under the budgeted amount quoted. If you're looking for a job done well and done right, look no further!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"This company is awful! They cancelled on us last minute (twice!), called my husband to reschedule for later in the day. He missed the call so they just cancelled all together.

We are furious with this company!

Reply to the owner because there isn't a reply button:
The account is under my husband not me. We have already found another company do to your unprofessionalism.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"I'd give 0 stars if I could. I can't give any stars to a company that hasn't done anything.  I have been waiting for a month to have someone come out just to look at my damaged gate.  I had been contacted by Danny and told repeatedly ""I'll be there tomorrow."" And that never came.  I then called the office again and was told someone would call me.  Never got a call.  I called the office again and insisted on having Al, the owner, call me back to get it done.  I was called by him Friday and was told ""I'll be there on Tuesday.""  It's now Wednesday, no show AND no call.  Only reason we haven't gone elsewhere is because the gate was installed by them and was hoping for some sort of warranty coverage."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I rented through Wright Property for over a year and was way underwhelmed with their level of dedication to pretty much everything.  When I reached out to report a leaky faucet, broken closet door or noisy neighbor, they pretty much completely ignored me unless I harassed them and even sometimes not even then. They keep wonky hours and never seem to be in the office when they say they will and just generally struck me as very unprofessional. Also, when I moved into the apartment it was not very clean at all, but still they kept part of my deposit when I moved out after I diligently scrubbed the entire place from top to bottom.
The only upside? When I went in to pay rent they were perfectly friendly, but I wouldn't rent from them again, nor would I trust them with my property."

Home Services,4.5,OR,First time  getting a crack on my windshield while driving on a freeway. Patricia at the front desk was very polite on the phone and helpful. No need appointment which I was very happy about. I needed to get this fixed ASAP and was stressing about. Robert did an estimate cost and gave me good advice about car windshield repair. Very knowledgeable and most important what to expect. I waited 15-20 min and my car was ready. I was very amazed to see the results. You can bearly see it compare to what it was. Will be using their services again. Highly recommend going to Brite Glass. Also if you go online you can find coupon for $39.99 windshield repair and can save 10$. Thank you Robert and Patricia for taking care of me today! Pretty fantastic customer service and experience in your shop!
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I've been using Insect IQ since I moved to Tampa in 2014. I rarely see pests in my house, and if I do they send someone out right away, sometimes even the same day. My regular technician Alex is extremely knowledgeable and has given us several tips of things we can do to keep our home pest free. I did hit a bit of a snag with them customer-service wise when we discovered rats in our home and I felt the company was not very responsive, but the manager Conner stepped in and went above and beyond to keep us as customers and the technician Dareis who helped us get rid of the rats was very knowledgeable as well. This is really a company that believes in treating customers right, and I will continue to use them as long as I live in this area."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Called yesterday to schedule a date for moving for a week out.  Said someone would call today to give final details, but that I was set.  Never asked for a deposit to hold or made it appear that in less than 24 hours when they call me that the date could be given to someone else.  When I talked to them she informed me that she gave that date to someone else this morning and now has nothing between now and the end of next week.  If you are going to tell someone a date then you need to hold that date!   If you want/need a deposit to make sure you can save the date - then that should be mentioned - I would have!! Very rude and have found a different company.  Not how you do business."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Right now I'm renting one of the newly renovated spaces. There were a a few things that needed fixing still and were missing and I had to remind them several times. My a/c unit wasn't working for weeks and they kept coming and telling me nothing was wrong with it, there was a waterfall coming out of the vented ceiling so obviously there was. Finally they tell me that something needed replacing and it works for now. However our electric bill is over 200 bucks for the last couple months which is ridiculous for 2 people even in the summer! They must have an inefficient system to cool their units, the manager didn't care when I asked for some insight as to why it was so high and said to resolve the issue with TEP. I will not be renewing my lease with this place!"
Home Services,4.0,OR,"This place is amazing and the staff is amazing. Everyone is so sweet professional and helpful. Everyone goes above and beyond to make sure you feel at home and welcomed even after the ink has dried on your lease lol. The only thing I don't like about this property is the water pressure. It takes forever to fill the bathtub up and I love to feel a lot of pressure when I shower so I feel clean. It would be nice if the pressure was better so I could
Clean my bathtub effectively each time. The location is perfect and the amenities are nice. I wanted a garage with my home, but my full size suv wouldn't fit. This is exactly the reason why I always ask for six month leases when I rent an apartment for small reasons that make big difference in everyday living."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"I had read good reviews on their own website (first mistake) and since they had various ""specials"" I went ahead and called.  I figured since I only have carpet in my living room, hallway, and one bedroom, the cost would be around $100 to clean it (including the ""sales"").  After the basic cost, plus several ""additional stain removal fees,"" my total came to slightly over $200.  At that point I thought, ""OK, well I got charged twice what I originally had thought to pay, but they did pretty good work...""

.... until I walked into my bedroom and found that the small furniture (chairs and such) had been unceremoniously dumped onto my white down comforter. It was dirty, so there went my nice white bed.

For those two reasons, I would give them 3 stars and a word of caution to their future clients."

He provided two different options for our specific roofing problem. We made a choice and the work began quickly on the roof. We were impressed with the staff who were doing the roof repairs as well as the leadership who would stop by to asses how the job was going. We will be replacing our roof in about six years and look forward to dealing with such a reputable company. The cost was upfront and clear and the work was completed timely.

Home Services,2.5,CG,"I moved in last November, and it was an absolute nightmare. The leasing office was horrible. They basically told me to get a ""no-show"" notice when I moved in. I was told it would be fixed in a few days. This was only two days after I moved in. I was told I would be charged a ""minimizing fee"" for the additional time I was charged. When I asked for it to be fixed, they told me I had to pay it back in full for the extra time. I felt like they were taking advantage of me. When I went to get a notice, they told me it would be ""free"" to get it fixed in the next two days."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"As a longtime former customer...a truly, truly awful experience. TV, with its energy-hogging overheating MOXI box failed me numerous times. The ""repair"" people who came out were all freelance kids who never could get my channels working. Support people on the phone (other countries?) would only tell you to restart your box. Billing mistakes would only get you apologies with no one having the authority to fix it. Charter also boosts the volume on their inserted commercials, mostly all More Furniture and Eat at Joes, their only 2 sponsors. The internet speed is great but would constantly just stop. The guy who came to disconnect me didn't even give me a chance to say hello, saying the many others he disconnected heaped abuse on him before he could start talking.
Anyway, with AT&T Uverse now, paying a lot less and am amazed how better their system is."

Hey Louie
I am sorry you felt that you had to ""fire"" me as a client.  All I ever wanted was for better customer service and help when I needed it.  I am sorry we could never see eye to eye either.  I am not sure what you are referring to in your response here to my review when you say I caused a lot of these issues and that I had no shows to appointments, as these were never brought to my attention when I was a customer...perhaps part of our issue.  I expected better from your company and am extremely disappointed in your customer service.  Anyways, thanks for your response and I am glad you found the time to respond to my Yelp review, as I know you never found time to return my calls."

His name is Sergei and I have pictures of him.  Over $55,000 in damages to our home property and they never returned a phone call from me.

My dad was thinking of getting siding put up so he would not have to paint anymore. High pressure sales pitch. The guy was a major BS artist. He talked for over an hour, brought samples in the house. Had his laptop looked up stuff. He looked the part. In the end he would not commit to a price. That was the reason why my dad invited him in, to get a freaking quote. My dad ended up kicking the guy out after he was giving him the run around. Now they won't stop calling. So guess what? I blocked their phone number. Done. ! ;-) Don't even talk to these people."

Home Services,5.0,OR,"THE BEST. I can't recommend Jersey Lawn Care highly enough.  My front lawn was destroyed by a prior landscaper and I wanted to put down sod, but I was concerned about the cost. Jersey Lawn Care worked with me to figure out where it made the most sense to put down sod, and where we could try to save the existing grass.  They also helped me deal with a surprise problem with my sprinkler system on the morning that the sod was going in.  Finally, they also shaped and filled in beds and planted shrubs.  With everything that they did, they made sure I understood what was going on and how I would need to care for everything. They also had great solutions for standing water problems in the backyard. My property looks AMAZING now. I'll never work with any other company!"

The property management company is very responsive to residents. They are very professional, considerate, and respectful. The property manager is a good person, very attentive to his clients, and works very hard. 

The property manager also does a great job at communicating with residents. We have a very large dog that is not only barking but is also very loud. The property manager does a great job"
Home Services,3.5,CG,I had them come out and do the work and they did it perfectly! They were thorough and thorough.  I had a lot of questions and they were very professional. They were able to go over my house quickly and fixed a few things. I would recommend them to anyone.I moved from a 2 bedroom with a 2 bedroom with a 2 bath and a 1 bedroom with a bath. I was very disappointed with the quality of the flooring and the lack of color in the walls.  I had to go back and forth with the leasing office to find out what was wrong.  They are very honest and they work hard to make sure that the apartment is not overpriced and they work hard to make sure that I am satisfied
Home Services,4.5,CG,I recently used Hall Brothers and they were the best. I will definitely recommend them to anyone looking to get an affordable property.

He said he would be at the house by 10am.  I called back at 11:15am.  He said he would be at the house by 2:30pm.  I called back at 2:45pm.  He said he would be at the house by 3:30pm.

The guy that came to fix it said it was a ""twist"".  He said it would be $100 a piece.  I said it would be $300 and he said it was $110.  He said it would be $50 and he would get it fixed.

Home Services,1.5,CG,"When I lived in Tampa, Tampa Bay, and elsewhere in Tampa, I had a very strong interest in the downtown area. The condo, office and office space were great. The staff was nice, and the apartments were in good shape. The staff was friendly and friendly. There was also a small maintenance crew that was friendly and helpful. The apartments are very well maintained and clean. They are very modern and have all the amenities I expect from a real estate agent. I would recommend them to anyone. I would highly recommend the Ameri-Courier for all of your plumbing needs. In short, I needed a replacement for my dishwasher that was replaced on a Saturday night."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We had some wainscoting cracking in our home, before just having it fixed up we wanted to find the issue causing it. The main water pipe is on the same wall, so for peace of mind we called ALD to come out to make sure we did jot have a pipe leak. When Dave came out he immediately got moisture readings on his device. After testing our pipe there was absolutely no evidence of a leaking pipe. This was of course good news, but Dave did not stop there, he was determined to help find the culprit. After investigating different areas, he found that our window frame was the culprit, showed me exactly how and why! Now we can fix everything knowing the exact issue and we did not tear our walls apart doing so! For a mysterious possible home leak I can not recommend ALD enough!"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I sent out a quote request through Yelp and Chad the owner was quick to respond with details of the price structure. He was very responsive and great with communication through email or text. 

Kanin was the handyman that showed up and completed the work. He was very courteous and seek to understand the work I wanted done. Kanin would check in on steps to ensure placement and work is aligned to my expectations. He transparently called out any nicks or scratches that occurred during the work and made the corrections to ensure it aesthetically looks good and clean. His attention to detail made the experience easy for me vs stressing out if the work is being done correctly. 

I would definitely use The Nashville Handyman again for any house projects. Also they are locally owned business with integrity, does not over charge, and delivers quality work."

Home Services,2.0,OR,"In 2013, I bought a home and my realtor recommended Joe to do my inspection. Now, 3 years later, I am selling my home. My buyers home inspector found decades old and incredibly unsafe knob and tube wiring throughout over 50% of my house. It is very visible as you walk down the basement stairs and, not only did Joe completely miss it, but knob and tube wiring was not even mentioned in his report. His major error is costing me over $5,000 at closing in a few weeks. Today, while searching for Joe's company on Yelp to write this review, I discovered that, not only is he an incompetent home inspector, he is a liar and a cheat. Last week, he was arrested and charged with 137 counts of fraud and counting. Please reference the article below and stay the hell away from this man!!

She opened up our frig and started to help pack it then even wiped out the inside and cleaned it for us. 
Everyone was so nice and they took very good care of our furniture. All the help was great and friendly. They arrived a few minutes late but did get started right away. 
The communication throughout was great and clear. If you are looking for a great small move local company with a personal touch this it. Thank you Gloria for all your help and your team."
Home Services,4.5,OR,Very unpleasant experience. Our rental has gone up for sale but with 8 MONTHS remaining on our lease. We attempted to purchase the home but cancelled the contract after several reasons but we did not appreciate Marcy thinking she would trick us into going unrepresented. We agreed to an open house after many harassing  calls/texts and our camera caught the realtor holding the open house moving the temp on our AC. Is there a reason why you have to have the home freezing cold? Those are our utilitie$. After 2 open houses we've been harassed into private showings even though we have months left on our agreement. Most traditional lenders won't continue with financing if you can't move in within 60 days so what's the rush? The team sees two young women and assume they can test the law and legal agreements but we have lawyers.

This has gone on many, many, many times! Expect to blow all your vacation time for the year waiting on people that don't show up. And, when they show up, they do poor work! It's always, ""oh, we fired that guy!"" The ponds and common area were suppose to be the focal points. The common area is weedy and not mowed around and they drained the ponds? No one knows why, they just did. Expect either a good outcome or a one year hellish nightmare! Your choice to roll the dice!"

His prices were reasonable enough that I asked him to do a few other tasks in addition, and he obliged and stayed a little later than expected to get the job done. He and the team were respectful, quick, and very thorough. They had everything done in 90 minutes, which included trimming two trees back from electric wires, taking down two very large branches growing over a fence, removing a stump, and a few other things. When they were done, they cleaned everything up, didn't miss a thing and left my yard looking quite nice. To top it off, Richard is a very pleasant man and I found his crew friendly as well. I will definitely be calling them again and can't say enough positive things about our interaction this morning!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We bought our first home with Jon in 2016 and when it was time to buy again, we immediately went back to him.  This time he helped us purchase and sell.  We cannot recommend Jon enough.  He really knows this market and area and is incredibly honest with the good and bad of any home.  We relied on him during showings to point out all of the things he sees in a house - way beyond what we would ever recognize on our own (potentially hazardous trees / type and quality of roof / construction quality, etc).  Combined with Madeline, his Director of Operations, you cannot go wrong with Jon.  I dont know how he does it, but he really does make you feel like you are his only client (even though I cant even wrap my mind around his daily schedule!!)"

The employee assured me a technician was already assigned to my case and would definitely be here.  I asked twice if there was any way she could give me a time frame so I didn't waste the whole evening.  Finally at 7:30 I called and after waiting on hold for over 10 minutes they connect me to a technician who said he couldn't hear the lady who told him my name and asked when a good time to come would be (ummm almost 4 hours ago when it was scheduled).

I don't think he saw the review yet and he had a good excuse for missing the appointment.  Stuff happens--I totally get it.  He was very flexible and fit in an estimate the next day at a time outside of his normal schedule.  

He was able to do an estimate without me being on site but was also willing to stay in case my husband or I had any questions for him.  I haven't completely decided whether I would use his services to fix the fence but it the estimate sounded reasonable and he was able to understand my needs/wants instead of trying to sell me something completely out of budget."

They told us that we get granite counters in the apartments and they are fake as the side fell off and exposed what it really is.  Also, the office staff doesn't do a great job responding to your complaints.  We would go inside and complain about problems in the apartment or in the community and they would kind of brush it off like it didn't happen.  Also, they will wrongfully assume you did something and send you a notice about it and they don't really care about the people who live here.  Also, I would go into the office and the ladies would be taking trash about people who just came in here in front of everyone.  This is extremely unprofessional.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"I'm disappointed after reading such great reviews. The crew did a fine job on my bathrooms and kitchen, but apparently a lot of what I'd consider standard for a residential cleaning (making the beds, replacing the bags in the trash bins) is an extra fee-- this was not disclosed or presented as an option so it just didn't get done. After paying for a deep clean, I was bummed to find several areas that were obviously missed (see photos). Won't use them again. Note: we did have a miscommunication on the square footage, and I immediately agreed to a 20% increase in the quoted fee, without question, when Markese indicated the home was larger than he expected. Splash was compensated to do a deep clean for the home *at an agreed-upon price upon seeing the home and its size, in person* and they did not complete a thorough cleaning."

He had no problem removing my old blinds at no extra cost and they even paint matched the new shutters to a specific paint at no extra charge.  Now that the shutters are in, we could not be happier with the look and quality.  Aztec stands behind their product and I have no doubt that if I needed an adjustment or damaged them that Aztec would be right there to help.  Don't be afraid of the lower price.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I know, like and trust Derrick Polder and my experience with him has been excellent. Perhaps that's because I'm not a first time home buyer with unrealistic expectations. Yes the process is time consuming and hectic and they ask a lot of questions, but that's because you're begging a bank to loan money to you. (If you were going to loan 6-figures to a stranger, wouldn't you check their credit, take your time and ask a lot of questions too?) Typically, if you're not happy with your interest rate or points, etc, it has more to do with your income, ratios and credit worthiness than the broker you've hired. He doesn't make money unless your loan is funded, he's on your side. Derrick is rated in the Top 1% nationwide by Mortgage Originator Magazine. That's why I recommend him and his team. They get loans funded and that's what counts."

We wanted to replace the old Rheem with a new Rheem, and the furnace had to fit in a short space. 

Steve C returned my call promptly, didn't try to sell us anything we didn't need, and recommended the best system for our house - not the most expensive one, but the right one. He stopped by during the installation, which took less than a day. The technicians were friendly and competent, and they completely cleaned up afterwards. By the afternoon, the new a/c was humming along nicely.

I didn't know where to begin, so we scheduled an appointment with Dan and the Eco Landscapes team. They arrived promptly for the walkthrough and we discussed what we wanted out of the space. Dan, Taney and team were extremely helpful in identifying the plants vs weeds and what we could do to open up the space and add some much needed color.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"Freezer part of refrigerator was not working - paid $550 to replace the ""main board"". The freezer STILL does not work, AND now the refrigerator side is ALSO WARM. They wanted to charge for a service call to check it out within the 30-day warranty period.

These guys are crooks - find another service.

Follow-up: Unfortunately, this Company posted an entirely dishonest response. They obviously supplied a defective part, since NOW THE REFRIGERATOR DOES NOT WORK.

And they try to make me the bad guy? That's a good one! I'm the CUSTOMER, and I'm the bad guy, AND they don't want people like me as a customer? LOL

If they were reputable, they would immediately fix the problem. There's a 90-day warranty on the part - I WANT IT REPLACED BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR TEMP IS 68 DEGREES!!!!!!!!

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I contacted CTS Paint Pros through Yelp & was able to get a consultation with Elmer soon after. I was in a pinch & needed the walls repaired & painted prior to moving in, which only left Elmer & his team a little less than a week from the consultation. To add on to the obstacles, there was also a snowstorm that took away 2-3 days from the week. The previous owners of the house left a few nail holes that needed to be repaired in every room so I went from thinking I only needed to repair & paint a few walls to basically repainting the entire house.  Elmer's team was great!  They were able to repair & paint the walls in two days.  They did a decent job considering the small window of time I was able to provide them. I recommend Elmer and his team."

The sales rep was very knowledgeable, on time for the appointment and took the time to listen to our issue.  We called about 5 companies and only a two showed up.The sales person found that the roof was leaking from multiple places and provided pictures so we could understand what was going on. The roof was over 30 years old so we decided to have it replaced instead of repaired. They arrived on the scheduled date, very early and completed the job the same day. They were careful to cover all the bushes and landscaping around the house. They did a great job cleaning everything up before they left. The roof looks great. It doesn't leak anymore and we are very happy. I would highly recommend this contractor."

I was very disappointed with the quality of the flooring and the lack of color in the walls. I had to go back and forth with the leasing office to find out what was wrong.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Marx and his crew did a wonderful job removing two large pine trees from our property and trimming out dead branches on several other trees. He worked for the Forest Service and knows trees how how to trim them. He doesn't use spikes to climb the trees, thus he doesn't harm the trees when working on them.
He's been one of the ""go to"" guys in our neighborhood and has done work for at least 4 other neighbors. (All of us had a lot of damage from the big storms in 2017.) He also very knowledgable about mistletoe and has removed lots of it from the trees up here off of Mt. Rose Highway. All of my neighbors who used Marx and his team have pleased with his work. His pricing is fair, maybe not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for.  I wouldn't hesitate to use Marx's crew again."

I got a time set up for install and waited one day from ""8-5"" and no one showed up.  The date given was only for UPS to deliver the modem (don't have to be home for that!) and then you do a self install.

I was in my living room doing some paperwork while they got started. Before no time they were done! Ceiling fan was in place, working. Receptacles were changed out, working just fine. They cleaned up and was finished in just a little over an hour. The price was fair for the job that was done.

 But no follow-up or maid service provided. Very Kind over the phone service from their employees extremely professional. It's almost as if these people are not a maid service at all. 
They simply collect as much of your private life as they can but offer no cleaning at all. Why take customer information address cell & home numbers knowing your not going to provide any services.

The sales rep who quoted the project was very helpful and worked through many questions for a complex project. However, after scheduling the install day, I was informed by the sales rep that they would no longer be completing the project due to it costing more money than they originally anticipated during an internal review.

This seemed very odd as we had a signed agreement and been planning this work for many months.  They were scheduled to install in 3 days and I had already removed most of the existing insulation to remediate some issues that they identified.  I requested that ownership reach out to better explain what was going on and confirm that they would not be doing the install. I asked to advise if there were any other options.

Nelson clearly stated over the phone he could provide key, quoted price and scheduled time and then once we arrived he quickly determined he couldn't assist us. 

This was a ridiculously bad customer service experience.  Nelson stated he didn't realize we would be making a special trip for this service and after hearing my displeasure he muttered an apology as we were leaving.

Their website asks the client to call and confirm the appointment before the reserved date; which I have for the past three days! No answer; just a voice who refers me to an e-mail. My first cleaning (scheduled three months ago) is a no show on their part. Typically, I do not report these kinds of things; however, with the many cleaning companies in the greater Nashville area, they are a waste of time! Consider a professional company who desires the business. If you have bought the Groupon, simply call the website and ask to be refunded. It is worth every penny back!

Now 3 months have gone by since that day and I've called, emailed, contacted headquarters. The operator tells me he claims dept is so busy it's typical I don't hear anything back from anyone. Michael Davis is the claims person. You should not have to pay for your move until everything is settled. Ridiculous. The packers just threw everything in boxes, literally just dumped drawers out into boxes. I could have done that myself.

I'm all for businesses conducting themselves as they see fit, and I can understand a locksmith not being able to reprogram a certain make of vehicle (another locksmith informed me that they did not reprogram my make, and was perfectly nice about it). However, making it seem like you don't want to deal with a potential customer because their circumstances are ""a real pain"" may not be the best way to go about running your business.

I got the appointment time I wanted, and their pricing is competitive with other well-reviewed shops in the area. On appointment day I got a friendly text reminder, and they even texted me directions when I asked. The shop is small, but very clean and professional. They had a small waiting area with a nice size TV for their guests, but I chose to leave the car and have lunch. As promised, about two hours later I received a call my car was done.

Unfortunately I use this branch location on occasion. All of the workers in there are rude. They have lousy customer service and they act like they do everyone a favor by ""being open"".  I was just there and once again and I waited forever. The tellers (only two speak decent English) are slow and could careless about moving faster than a postal worker.

My one issue was with the amount of time it took for the first move. Even though it did not ending up costing me much more (there is a minimum), I was exhausted and wanted to get it done. One of the guys was fairly new and they were tired from an earlier move that day. I could certainly understand that, but it affected me nonetheless.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I haven't had their regular tan, but the organic tan was absolutely the best sunless tan I have ever had. Looked so natural and made a huge difference in my wedding dress. Everyone said my skin looked gorgeous. Adrienne asks you how tan you would like to be and then considers your natural skin tone before hand mixing your custom color solution. She applied the tan so efficiently, I swear it only felt like only 60 seconds, and yet took the time to paint on body lotion in places that shouldn't be so tan to block the absorption. After the spray, she then hand dusts powder in areas like inside elbows to prevent lines from forming. I'd  say it lasted at least 7 days, and I didn't do anything special to keep it lasting longer. All around the best service I have ever received! Highly recommend if you are thinking about sunless tanning."

He is very friendly, answers questions and does a very clean install.
   When you call Affordable, Christian's wife answers the phone and schedules an estimate and then an install date after accepting the estimate via email.

Overall, I am very happy with Affordable. They are excellent people to deal with and a great job well done !"

I called them the next day, and they said the installers had to be sent to the customer service department. I spoke to a manager who told me I had to call them again. I was told they would send the installer to the customer service department. I was told I could go to my credit union to get a refund. They never called me back. I was told I would have to pay back my money the next day. I called again and was told I would have to pay back the $100.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"Do NOT rent and apartment from First Lake Properties. It has been by far that worst experience I have ever had.  

We Moved into our apartment in the Severn Point Complex after we returned to the city from Katrina. My Husband had accepted a job and we had to move in a hurry. There was no time to make a tip before to look for a place so I had a friend scout come out for me. The Space is small and poorly constructed. The Rent is high and the service leaves a lot to be desired. 

Everyone they hire to do maintenance is completely incompetent. They do not know how to turn off water so my apartment flooded three times in the last two days. Then they don't know how to clean up the water. Even the person they hired to clean the carpets cant get it right. I cannot wait to leave."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"My boyfriend moved into one of these properties about a year ago. It has been nothing but drama and poor communication ever since then. I paid $50, twice, to cosign for a lease they never put him on because he did not have sufficient credit. He was never put on a lease and the money vanished. They also took his entire deposit and put it towards ""back rent"" that doesn't exist, and continue to harass the tenants for additional money they insist they owe. I poured over all of the receipts before they sent them in to ensure the rent was 100% paid on time and not short at all, they sent all of this information to the landlords to just be told ""We don't have time to look through all of that."" It's not a real estate company so much as an business of extortion. I would not recommend you rent from this company."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Chandre and Monica are two woman that are go getters. Strong work ethic but caring and straight up.

They offered us another rental property immediately and after some consideration we moved into another of there rentals that suited our needs. 
The key to a good landlord / tenant relationship is to pay rent on time. Your home is first bill to be paid period. Take care of your home while your in it and respectful. Do this and when or if something bad happens in life you have some credibility and people will be willing to help you. 
Legacy properties as a business seems well adept and legitimate. The woman of Legacy are fantastic."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I placed an order with IKEA, and Ellis Moving was supposed to handle it. First, they said they had only the desks (10, which was 1/2 of the entire order) and that IKEA would have to resend the rest of the order (10 chairs). IKEA did so. Then, they delivered only the chairs and said that they didn't know anything about any desks, the very desks they said they had more than 2 weeks ago. Never again. It doesn't take that long to drive down to Atlanta, and I'd rather drive for 8 hours round trip than wait 5 weeks for Ellis Moving to deliver items they've had the whole time. Edited to add: I've never written a Yelp review, and I don't intend to in the future. However, the experience I've had with Ellis Moving was so infuriating that if I can in any way steer someone clear of this business, it's worth it."

The building was built in the late 1980s and was quite a bit older than the buildings that I lived in.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Third service call on three different forced air furnaces in seven years.  Today's problem was odd behavior by the furnace controller, which turned out to have been caused by four factors that, when combined, but only when combined, caused the controller to shut down the burner.  If it had not been for the high degree of experience of the service technician, it would have been impossible to alleviate the problem on-site.  As it was, a series of small adjustments, and a homeowner fix to a damaged flue, were all that were required.  Very reasonable charges for an emergency call-out:  One hour drive time plus two hours working on-site for a total of $252.  Also, the local office had a complete record of the previous call-outs and knew what installed equipment we had.  Came the same day as called.  Arrived exactly on time (to the minute) for the appointment."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We're moving to Goleta from Los Angeles and needed some interior painting in our new house. We had some general ideas about colors but nothing specific. The day of the estimate Justin showed up right on time, was both professional and fun and gave us a very competitive estimate. He also gave us some color ideas that wouldn't clash with the paint on the other walls.

We came up this morning to see the end result and could not be more thrilled. The quality of the work was outstanding and his color suggestions were spot on. The two rooms he painted were exactly the result we were looking for. He's even coming back on Monday with a couple of extra guys to move the piano in the living room back to its original position.

If you need professional painting done incredibly well, on time and on budget, do yourself a favor and call Justin at Fresh Coat Painters."

After making a deal one of the sheds on the property came up missing. We were told it was stolen however the items that had been inside of it were neatly placed in the crappy shed left behind.  Then, after our final walk through, the seller's agent new the seller had returned to the property and removed the refrigerator, washer, and dryer from inside the home as well as a swing from the patio.  When our agent called her on it the response was basically that the deal was done so it was none of her concern.  Now I'm out $1100 + to replace and will be contacting the attorney generals office, better business bureau, social media, and basically any other agency that will look into this office."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"We found Kevin through some friends he had helped find a house in the Mesa area and had been very pleased.  Happily, he was even more familiar with our target neighborhood, San Roque, since he lives there.

Kevin has deep market knowledge which came in handy in our search during a fast-moving market.  With houses selling in days, Kevin was able to show us some houses just as they were hitting the market so we could get the jump on things.  

The offer/sale process went very smoothly due to Kevin's sage advice and counsel. Our close was a bit tricky due to some complications on our end. Kevin kept calm and steered us through the process.  

Now that we own the house, Kevin is a great source for all the resources we needed to start our renovation process.

Also, he is really easy to deal with and very responsive to any and all requests."

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Ken and his sons did an excellent job on my windows, screens, frames and tracks.  They were very courteous and accommodating. But what made them stand out were the extras.  Ken called ahead asking if it would be convenient for my family if he showed up early versus other vendors who show up early without calling and then want you to adjust your schedule because it was more convenient for them.  Ken also cleaned my garage door as well as removed some calcium water deposits without charging extra.  Moreover, the initial quote did not cover the cost of the job because of some confusion.  Instead of trying to renegotiate the price, Ken took responsibility and honored his quote. No fighting or squabbling.  He made it right - fair and straight forward.

This place is completely overpriced and I have had a below average experience here. 

Today was by far the worst!! I called to complain about my new neighbors chainsmoking cigarettes in the apartment next to me.

Since I was home, James stopped by within 15 minutes with the part, confirmed his diagnosis, and quickly make the repair. I had called James for this oven repair because during the past several years he had quickly addressed problems with our Jenn-air fridge and Whirlpool washer. James worked quickly and carefully (for example, he spread out a  drop cloth to ensure the floor was protected while he worked). He is personable, straight-forward, and willing to explain everything he is doing and why. I thought the service fee was quite reasonable.

Upon removing the old tank, Mike and his team discovered some significant water damage and mold to the platform that the tank sits on.  They were able to put the water heater on an extension that allowed us to have hot water for the week that the mold problem was cleaned and River City also subcontracted with a construction company that fixed all the drywall and rebuilt the platform.  Throughout the entire process, Mike was professional, friendly, available to my constant questions and texts, and he even reached out a week after the work was done to make sure we were happy with everything. We were very happy overall with River City Plumbing and Mike. Thank you for everything!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Our inspector's name was Gregory Thomas.  The process of inspection seemed fine until after the seller moved out all of his furniture and we saw a TON of water damage throughout the house.  Our inspector did not catch any of this during his inspection of the house.  He did not look around enough or check behind furniture.  Because of this we had to back out of buying the house since this was not found during inspection and it was considered to be us backing out of buying the house simply because we did not want to buy.  Because of this we lost a lot of money.  Had this been found during inspection by a competent inspector, and indicated in the report, we would have saved over $3000.  Extremely disappointed with their services is an understatement and does not even begin to describe how poor this entire experience was for us."

Unfortunately that was the best part of the experience.  I read good reviews and was expecting that my family members would get a thorough cleaning. The pricing is based on the numbers of rooms and bathrooms so one would expect that all of these places would be cleaned. 
That was not the case at all.  Most rooms weren't touched, counters were left dirty with just one wipe.  Floors were left drenched, and dust remains in the entire house.

Unfortunately, apparently they shipped 3 packages, but one of the packages was in two pieces taped together that got separated.  When I finally opened all the packages, ready to install them, I found that many parts were missing.  I called Salter customer support.

I contacted John when I realized the leak was continuing and he said to contact him in 24 hours if it continued, free of charge because there was no leak originally! I gave it a little longer, just to make sure it was in fact a leak. He then NEVER returned my calls or texts regarding the issue.

Home Services,4.5,CG,"Wonderful company to do business with. The guys were friendly, professional and did a great job. The owner, B. B. C. , is very knowledgeable and honest. The company is now taking over my home and will be using them for future construction. This is a great property manager and I would recommend them to anyone!They are terrible. I have had several companies come out to replace my AC unit. They have not even replaced the AC unit. They have not even replaced the motor. They are giving me a $250. 00 refund for the AC unit that was just replaced. They are not honest. I have called multiple times and been told they do not care about the customer. I am paying $300. 00 to replace my AC unit. They are not honest."
Home Services,3.5,CG,"As a business owner, I find it incredibly frustrating to have to deal with this kind of customer service. I had a friend, who lives in the area, who was very rude to me and had no idea what I was talking about. I called and spoke to the manager, who said that they could have just called and called him back. I called back and was told that she didn't want to discuss it, and that she would have to call me back. I'm not sure if this is something that the manager has been able to handle, but I was just so appalled that I had to call back. I reached out to some other companies to get a quote, and none of the others I spoke to were able to reach out to me."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"So I called Nolan Painting and set up a appointment to have an estimate for a small paint job and spoke to one of there phone reps regarding a date and time and description of the job. I explained that it was a small job potentially 1 wall to paint. After the appointment was made and job explained I was scheduled to have someone come out in 2 weeks to look at the job. The morning of the estimate I get a call from Chris Nolan about 1 hour before the appointment time that my job is too small and will not cost more then $575, so they will have to cancel the appointment and job. Thanks for wasting my time!  Make sure you don't use this company for a small job because they will not tell you this when you set up the appointment. They are only interested in big jobs."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"We just had our floors replaced by Heritage Hardwood Floors and they look beautiful.  The whole experience couldn't have gone any better.  Terry and her staff handled everything from finding movers to remove the furniture to final touch-ups on my woodwork.  I am very busy traveling frequently and they were able to work around my crazy schedule and got things done in a very reasonable time frame. Terry even recommended local tile shops and a great installer for another part of my project. The best part of the project is that the finished product looks so amazing.  They coordinated the new floors with existed cherry cabinetry and stair treads, so it looks like it all was done as one project.  I have had so any compliments on my new floors, I wish I had done it earlier. Thanks again to Terry and her staff. I would not hesitate to recommend or use them again!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I would actually rate UVL a 3.5 out of 5 stars. The packers on the packing up side prior to the move were great. Professional, timely, courteous and careful with our belongings. 

The driver was also good. The problems began when different things were being communicated by the driver vs. the move coordinator. We couldn't get a firm time frame for our delivery until the very last moment. Very inconvenient as we were moving from one State to another. 

The moving coordinators in the office were very punctual about getting back to me and were responsive and customer oriented. The problem, again, was with conflicting information given over the timeline for delivery and how many people would be unpacking on the delivery end. We paid for a full pack and unpack service so the unpack service could have been handled much more professionally. 

Overall, I would recommend UVL but be prepared to follow up constantly on the communication side."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Basically, everything they touched turned into aesthetic gold and this is truly the easiest review to write. I had done the due diligence on selecting the right contractor to side our house with Hardie-Board (Hardieplank). MHX was by far the best priced and based on the time and effort they put into completing this job, it was better then we expected. From the initial contact to the completion, the quality and professionalism was very apparent. There was no gimmicks or short cuts taken and honestly, they cleaned up every single day like it was the last day. I was thoroughly impressed with the project leader and entire crew. They all went the extra mile and were not flummoxed when i asked them to change or add something as the need arose. I;ll definitely be calling them again soon for our deck redux and addition."

The house is a mess and the maintenance staff is great, but that doesn't matter when it comes to your property. There are many things to be thankful for in the community, but the management is the most disappointing. 

I would definitely recommend this company.We had a problem with our gas heater and we called Electric Plumbing. They came out within an hour. They showed up on time, worked around the clock, and explained everything. They were very professional and professional and provided a great price.

They also kept my car clean. They were very polite and respectful and we couldn't be happier with our experience.

We would recommend Electric Plumbing"
Home Services,3.5,CG,"I contacted Water Heater Express and they were the best. I will definitely use them again!I am a two-time resident of the area and have had a couple of plumbing issues over the years.  

First, a leak in my water heater.  

Second, a woman in my unit failed to answer the doorbell and called to say that she could not make it in time to pick up the items that needed to be transported.  

I was told that the house is not open until the end of the month.  

I called the office and was told that there was no one at the office.  

I asked the office if there was a problem and was told that there was no one at the office. "
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Please do not use this company as your property manager. Their maintenance team is grossly incompetent and they are quick to keep billing you for work they don't get right the first time around. They left my tenants with a basement leak for 3 weeks. When I realized they didn't even identify the issue I had to contract another company to fix the leak. Due to the length it was left unattended it caused more damage to my property. All while my tenants were in the house. They had the audacity to tell me that they were not responsible for the additional damage. They actually wanted to charge me for the times their guys went out and didn't fix the problem. Its been over 30 days since i cancelled with them and they are still holding mt tenants last month rent and security deposit.

 Do not trust these people with your property.

I ended up  in court. What a mess."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Horrible experience. They were deployed by AHS like many other reviewers here. Because of AHS lack of responsiveness, I am still sitting here in August with no ac, suffering through one of the hottest summers in Phila. Started requesting service in June. That's not American Teams fault. But after giving up on the warranty company,  see them in court, I started getting estimates from hvac companies.  They all said my 15 yo ac shouldn't be repaired it should be replaced because it is an outdated system.  They were going to do  repair that would have cost me $1400 , and I'd have been stuck in the same situation next year. THAT IS their fault. The receptionist wouldn't answer the phone for me til I switched to my work phone which she did not recognize. She picked up then. Kristi never called back ever. I see she posted a 5 star review here. In conclusion,  RUN"
Home Services,5.0,OR,This is one of the fairest electrical companies out there. They are small and sometimes a little hard to get in contact with but once appointment is made rest assured they will be there. The 2 gentlemen that came to my home to run a new dedicated line for my over the range microwave. They came early but waited as to come when they said. They put on booties before they entered. They told me there names and where they were from. They came in prepared to work with the essential pieces and parts that they needed. They did it in less time than I would have assumed. Something like an hour and 30 minutes. They had to cut a piece out my soffit over the stove and they even replaced the hole with new spackle to close the hole. They were reasonably priced and the valued my time. Thank you for the dair price and great work. Mrs. E.
Home Services,2.0,OR,"Dealing with management here is excruciating. This overpriced property has a low rating for a reason. Obviously upon touring the property and move in they are helpful and very accommodating. Want to paint an accent wall(s)? Sure of course you can. What they don't tell you is ""when you move out we will charge you $150 A WALL to re-paint and no we will not give you the paint to paint it yourself.""
Put a rent check in THEIR Dropbox and received an eviction notice because they hadn't checked their dropbox and then had the nerve to say we owed late fees because their own staff checked the box late.
The unprofessional staff are trained with different information and will blame you if you're told something different by another staff member and then try to charge you for whatever the misguided mistake was.
Attached is one of the walls, 2 ft wide and apparently costs $150 to repaint.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"The worst HOA company by a mile!  We get petty violations all the time.  Latest one just proves how lazy and unorganized they are as a company.

Recently got a violation for the new lights we installed on our house several months back.  Well, we got it approved ahead of time, and are now getting a violation for not getting it approved?  Either they are lazy, unorganized or both.  

We have received other lazy violations in the past too.  One stating our tree branches were too close to the ground, when measured they were off in their assessment, but I trimmed them anyways.  Just a lazy person who drives through, taking as many pictures as they can, so they can write up as many violations as they can.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"My wife and I were looking for Apartments last week and we called Sand pebble. They said they had a unit available and that we should rush down and secure it with a $350 money order to hold it. We did, along with 2 $40 non refundable application fees. After calling the ""office"" more than 6 times during the week they never answered the phone but once. Even then Sabrina, the agent, said she was still waiting for my background check ( after 7 days ), so we went down to talk to her that this process is taking too long and that we found another apartment. She told us if that's the case then we are out of our $350 hold and the $80 app fees. So Kroner Investments had a scam going to steal $430 from desperate people looking for housing this near to Christmas! I can only imagine how many other people have suffered for their Corporate greed."
Home Services,3.5,OR,I was very pleased with the new roof they put on my townhouse. They were extremely professional and timely and communications were great. They even did a little bit of woodwork which extended the roof just enough to brick the side should I decide to do so later. I did a lot of calling around and got a lot of quotes and their prices were the best of the ones I trusted to do the job. A few were a little lower but I never make important decisions like this based strictly on the lowest price and the 2 that were lower I wouldn't even consider just based on my experience and judgement after 68 years of living experience tackling projects like this. I highly recommend them and they will be the company I'll be using from here on. It's getting harder and harder to find an honest company anymore and when you do find one you had better keep them!
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Beware!!! This company charges $45. for a service call even if no work was performed! The service person wrote up a $800 estimate for a leaking outside faucet! 
Instead of finding a less expense way to fix the problem, he went straight to the worst case scenario to replace the entire pipe and faucet! I know something wasn't right when he asked me how much I was expected to pay after I refused to get the work done. 

Today, another company came out and charged me only $20. bucks, because all that was needed was a little tighten. In less that a min, the job was completed. 

Obviously, Len The Plumber is out to charge up people unnecessarily. This company is a ripoff! 

When I called to speak to a supervisor about this horrible service, I was placed on hold so I'm complaining he

I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone!

Having the kitchen in the room was nice too but we did not use it. Good hot water in the shower. They do not want you to leave the dog in the room alone when you go out which is kind of a bummer but I completely understand and would do the same thing if I ran the place. Could you imagine how crappy it would be if you were trying to sleep and a dog was barking all night because it was alone? I appreciate that rule. People complained about the security cameras on some yelp reviews, really? Im sure if something happened to their car and there were no cameras they would complain too.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I rented out my house with this company for 2 years, when it was time for my renter to move out we decided to extend the lease a few months. The leasing agent told me one date and my renter another. I found out the day before my renter moved out that she was leaving and it left my house empty for a month. After much effort, I was able to convince them to give me my mortgage cost. I was out the income I would have had, had additional bills, and had to find people on my own to mow my lawn all while in a different state. I am very disappointed that they did not make right their wrong, that I had to beg them just to cover the minimum of the cost I was out. This was their mistake and I lost about 1k due to loss of income + additional expenses and had tons of additional stress."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"The Koto Group was a fine company to lease from until it came time to get our deposit for the house back. They never said anything was wrong with the condition we left the house in and even mailed us a check to cash. Unfortunately, when we went to cash said check, the bank refused to accept it and claimed it was invalid. Assuming it was a misunderstanding, we called Koto Group to look into it. This is when their representative Jen decided that since we were no longer leasing from their company, we were no longer worth her time. She told us to ""shut up"" and that it was not her responsibility. I'm not sure whose responsibility she thinks it is but seeing as they are the ones who have not returned our money to us, I believe that it is in fact their responsibility. Hopefully we can get this nightmare resolved and not have to deal with her again."

Since the beginning we experienced outages, service interruptions, lack of On Demand and third party content, terrible customer support, and many billing issues. Despite being assured the transition would be seamless,  my family and I have gotten nothing but horrendous experiences all around. Even after canceling my service with Frontier they still charged me another month before crediting it back to my account. They realized their error when I called them and they told me I can get a refund in the form of a Visa gift card in ninety days! This company deserves more than just a bad Yelp review but that is the only thing I have in my power to do. Horrible service, horrible customer support, and having to wait three months to fix a problem caused by them is beyond ridiculous and I hope some serious lawsuit or something of the sort comes due to them."

Some days it will cut out upwards of ten times a day. My boyfriend works from home and when the internet doesn't work, he loses money. Not only are we losing money for services paid, but for missing income. We have called numerous times, and have been told that since it doesn't show on their end, theres nothing they can do.

We can either continue to lose money, or fork over $200 for an ecf. They do not care. Also, the automated system is a joke. I just tried calling for the 4th time to make a payment and it cant find our account, even though it is the correct account number.

Devon and Skyler arrived and thoroughly explained everything to us. During there time here they were very respectful and polite. When they were finished we were shown pics of the Duct work . We were given an estimate for that work. I called Matt the  Service Manager and he gave us a much reduced price. Duct work was scheduled in the morning. 11am sharp installers arrived once again, very polite and knowledgeable. Work was completed very efficiently and in 3-4 hours they were done. Over all the entire repair work was done quickly and professionally. I highly recommend Acree Air for your A/C needs."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Great guys, very reasonably priced, efficient, friendly and RELIABLE... Story follows as to why this last trait was so important in my case...

Another moving company scheduled a move for me on a Friday at 3pm.. They never showed... Woke up panicked at 9am with an old apartment full of boxes and an empty new house, and no clue as to how I was going to get all my stuff moved.. Oh, it was the last possible day to move out of old place, and last weekend of the month...

After calling a bunch of places and getting laughed off the phone... Retro picked up, made room for me in their schedule.. Arrived on time, made two trips when they only expected to do one (moved within city) loaded and unloaded all within 3hrs.

My only criticism of Retro is that they don't charge enough. 10/10 will definitely make them my first call if and when I move again (hopefully not for a long time)."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Tony Baroni's team was awesome! Craig was my agent who assisted me with selling my grandparents condo. From start to finish, he was absolutely spectacular! He made sure I was in the loop with everything and kept in contact with me.
Cheri, helped with communicating and assisting with the closing and getting details of everything with made thing very seamless. To Louis who was in constant contact with following up with information he needed, which is awesome for me, I tend to forget, especially with a laundry list of things to do in one day. 
Tony's team was absolutely amazing and had my condo up and listed within a matter of DAYS! 2 to be exact. They staged, took photos and posted everything by day two after meet & was able to have the condo sold within two weeks! I couldn't be any more pleased. 
I would highly recommend Tony's team & Craig to help sell your home. You will receive exceptional service."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I have to write an update to my last review since several of the issues I mentioned previously in my list of cons have been updated.

1. ""Property management is sub-par ESPECIALLY maintenance""
Update: Overall property management is much better. Since I moved in, the buildings have been repainted, landscaping has been done with new plants and sidewalks added or repaired.

2. ""The clubhouse is often late to open but closes on time and is closed on Sundays""
Update: Whomever the offender was that was doing this seems to be gone because the clubhouse has been open during the regular hours posted for quite sometime now.

3. ""The trash compactor is a mess and often tenants will leave trash in front of it or in random areas across the property""
Update: This still happens from time to time but has been less of an issue. Mostly it seems to be a problem on the weekends when tenants dump large items so I can't blame the property for this."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I really like Houwzer's business model of having salaried agents and also having title/mortgage together. This meant a lot to me and I didn't even consider anyone else based solely on this business model. I didn't want to be dealing with an agent who I felt was relying on a ""sales approach"" with me, but would genuinely listen to my concerns and what I was looking for. I found that with Houwzer and with my agent, Emily, who really went above and beyond for me. She really knows how to read people fast and deal with them. I also started my search in the spring of 2020 but then stopped when the pandemic was raging. Waiting a year to get more financially sound was the way to go and even despite that, I didn't feel like Emily missed a beat when I was actually ready to go looking again and place an offer. So glad I went with Houwzer! I closed yesterday! :)"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Sarah, our property manager, was prompt with communication and availability. She worked with us even though we were moving into one of FLR's rentals, sight unseen, from out of state. In one of the bedrooms, they left two skateboards that were bolted to the wall. We, obviously, took them down and asked FLR what to do with them. They asked us to hold onto them, which I didn't understand. If they wanted to keep them, why not remove them from the walls in the first place? In the midst of moving out, we accidentally threw away the skateboards as they were tucked into a random bag in the garage. Well, we were charged $30 for the two decorative skateboards. A small cost, but one of those things that leaves a greater impression of their business practice as a whole. I was a bit disappointed with how little of our security deposit was returned, but overall, it was a solid experience renting from FLR."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"The worst. Hughes showed up without a vacuum because theirs was broken (really a cleaning company without a vacuum?) and proceeded to sweep my rug with a broom. They had no cleaning supplies of their own and used all of mine. I should have known there would be a problem when the first thing they did was mop the floor. Mopping is the last thing that you should do when you clean, after dusting and wiping baseboards. Speaking of, they didn't wipe the baseboards at all and when I requested they do it they lied and said they did. I wiped off a bunch of dust proving them wrong. I asked them to wipe down inside of the cabinets, inside the fridge. None of it was done. Ultimately my mother and I had to spend the entire day cleaning to get my place in move out condition. Quite honestly, I'm not sure what I paid for, except for someone to mop the floor."
Home Services,2.5,CG,"Not recommended. Always try to find an outside vendor to do the work.

The person was rude and did not tell me how much work was done. I asked him to leave and he said he would not go to my house because he was sick. He said he would check the work on the next day.

My family has been using this plumber for over 40 years. They are efficient and very knowledgeable. 

The female ""receptionist"" is so polite and caring. She gives you the sense that you are cared for, and the business cares about your needs. 
Just recently they were at our house in 24 hours to handle out needs.

Charles always takes care of us. He has a big heart.  His other service techs take the time to listen and treat your house in a respectable manner. I feel so comfortable knowing that when my mom calls for service, Charles is there. Especially since my father has passed away. He normally took care of that stuff. 

Pricing is very responsible. Even if prices were to go up I am sure my family would stay with them. We are loyal like that."

Hello, I feel your pain. I also contacted the CEO and was told that I am never to do that again. I was actually yelled at. That was about 2 weeks ago and still nothing changes. They stated that they will not call people, that I need to go on the chat. Type in all of the information clearly and in great detail. They said my text messages were not informative enough. Basically does not matter what you do you are wrong and they way they are handling it is the way it is going to be. They told me I was one of the few who had issue. But sure does not look like that to me reading all of these post every day. You know something it should not be based on how big or small you are. It is called customer service. As they say do not put all your eggs in one basket."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I hired BHC for two jobs in the past year.  From beginning to end it was a pleasant experience.  I met with the owner, Bill, who thoroughly discussed what needed to get done.  Bill was patient, never tried to upsell in fact quite the opposite.  He was clear on statement of work, time to start and time to finish.  The workers were all friendly and pleasant and they did a great job of cleaning up after they finished.  The completely re-did cat walk gutter which was rotting and a source of water leakage and did a lot of patch work on the main roof, as a kick in.  For the second job they totally re-did tile work, some insulation, masonry work around chimneys, and some much needed capping around my windows.  All of these were major issues and have been resolved.  I would definitely hire them again and have recommended them to a few friends"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"We had Ambry Design design 2 custom closets for us. Phillip was wonderful in designing exactly what I wanted. I did insist on making the Master Bedroom closet deeper close to the doorway and that was a wise choice I have lots of storage space now. The 2nd bedroom closet is a total wall unit with drawers & shelves with doors. These custom closets are such an efficient use of space since we have limited space. Everything is super organized now. Both are beautiful and made very well. Mia was wonderful and coordinated installation with me and very patient because the closets were made very quickly but our contractor was not ready with our spaces yet. We communicated every couple of months and just had them installed yesterday, took 2 days. Phillip & Mia are very customer oriented and it's so nice, a family run business! Installer worked very hard, did a nice job and was courteous. I'm very happy with both custom closets."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I hired this company because I had 2 (out of 2) non-functional toilets, and because I never learned how to repair drain valves and flappers, etc. 

Given that I couldn't get any local handymen to even call me back, much less come out, I called Roman Plumbing. 

Bear in mind that a plumber will charge much more than a handyman, and that they are more knowledgeable and accountable.

They responded the next day and repaired both tanks within several minutes.  

The following day, I wasn't sure if I had developed another problem, so I called them to come back out and check it. 

They did so, adjusted a chain, and were happy to explain all procedures and answer all of my questions.

Zachary is the go-to go getter for this business. He was very helpful, patient  and curteous. He is also the plumber that returned. This company stands behind their work.

I am very happy with the professional service that I received from Roman Plumbing."

I found out instead of the employee taking me off the budget plan not only did she keep me on it she didn't put through the full amount of it last month which lead me to believe I was taken off 2 months ago. Now I have to pay for that month plus the month of August. The parts and labor is a joke they charge extra for it and when you need it you spend even more.

Above all, (and this was a huge factor in my decision to utilize her services instead of other realtors I'd spoken with at the beginning) she wasn't pushy on any of the decisions.  She was very good at laying out the facts and providing guidance while leaving the decisions up to me without applying any pressure.  And at the end of it I ended up in a house I really like.  If you're a first time buyer, I'd highly recommend you bring Tiffany into your search to get you through the process.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"Now that the silly sales calls have stopped, things are much better. I highly recommend that you use Spectrum for your internet service (if you aren't in the itsy bitsy ATT Gigabit footprint in Reno/Sparks) and pick up a service such as Sling, Vue, YouTubeTV or even Philo (extra points for Vue/YTTV if you need local channels since they carry most of them) and tell them to keep their boxes. Once you pick up a Roku/Apple TV/Fire TV for your TVs you're going to have a much better experience overall. 

If you're reaallly hard up for local channels you can always do the Spectrum Stream TV tier which works with a couple of consoles, Roku and Samsung Smart TVs for your local channels as well.

The only real issue is that there is only two states that they are doing a trial version capping data and tucson happens to be one of them.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"As renters, we had a TERRIBLE time with T&H. They were very unresponsive to our minimal requests, but expected us to be ready with a few hours notice when they contacted us to enter the home. They even admitted to being ""short-staffed"" and very busy when they wouldn't answer calls for weeks. The people who showed us the house were not knowledgeable and gave us incorrect/incomplete information. They did not follow the terms of the lease. For example, the lease stated that they would rake our leaves and after 2 years and multiple requests, they never once raked them. One day there was a random key box installed on our front door and when we asked about it (being a safety concern), they said they didn't know what it was for and never contacted the owner to question it.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"Buyer's remorse with this place. Concept is great - hidden fees, management communication, not so great. 

I toured the lofts and loved the vibe and the amenities. Put my name on a wait list ($50 per person) to hopefully be placed in an apartment (no guarantee that'll you get the one you want). 

Luckily, one space did open up shortly after applying. Great news! Experience went downhill from there. Not only was I told to place a $400 deposit down before my application was processed, but I had to call multiple times to get answers to simple questions (lease term, is the deposit refundable (yes)). 

With all of the back and forth, we got cold feet and decided to make a big move to buy a house. When I then politely asked for the refundable deposit back, found out it's actually NOT refundable. Even though I had not yet signed any lease paperwork. Shocker. 

I could go on. But the single star above should tells it all."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Incompetent!  On the first page of his home inspection report, he had a picture of the WRONG house!  It wasn't even our house or street! We were selling our home and had Southern Arizona Home Inspector (Eric Almquist) do the inspection.  He had so many errors in the inspection report that the sellers were about to bail out.   We almost lost the sale. Not only did he put in the report that the furnace was 20 years old (it's easy to look at the model # and see that it's 9 years old), he documented that the home did not have rain gutters , yet his own photos in the report clearly showed the rain gutters. He also claimed a defect in the electrical panel that could only be found by removing a few screws -   There was no defect, and the inspector is NOT SUPPOSED to use any tools on the home at all during the inspection.  Lame."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I've moved a lot in my life and it's always more stressful and more expensive than I anticipate, so it's really essential to work with a great crew, especially as I'm now not physically able to do much myself.  I was moving into my new house on a narrow S. Philly Street over Labor Day weekend. All my possessions - furniture from a large home, 60 miscellaneous boxes, and lots of framed art - was all packed to the max in two very large storage units.   I got several quotes, and decided to go with Old City because I liked the quick, clear, and upbeat responses to my messages. Their prices are very fair. I needed two truck trips and four guys.  It went off like clockwork, just as promised.  The guys were lovely - interesting and good-humored, as well as fast and strong.  I hope I never move again, but if I do, I'd certainly call Old City Movers first."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I called them because the drain in my sink was draining slow.  The drain guy came out and said that I only needed about 2 feet of pipe replaced.  He charged me $180.00, but that was better than the 260 that he was originally going to charge me.  When the pipe guy got here he told me that it was the whole pipe that had to be fixed, which was a 25 foot pipe.  Well, he fixed it and cleaned up, and then charged me 450.  All in all, he came on time, was very professional, and cleaned up after he was finished.  The only items that they should be more mindful of how much water is on the floor and how much sludge or muck is splattering out of the pipes.  Also, it took a little longer that I was hoping and spent about 7 hours getting the job done.  Still, the serviceman was very nice and understanding."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"All I need is water, heat and electricity. Not hard but this company.... ugh. I understand that they're re-routing the water pipes in my building so they have to turn it off sometimes, which is fine. Just send us an email or post the times the water will be off so we can plan around it.

Tried to shower 2 hours ago, water turned off as I had a full head of shampoo with no way to wash it out. Waited and dried off, trying to be patient, wrapped my head up. Just got back in after the water appeared to be on and the same thing happened again. Called PMC 10x no answer, tried multiple extensions, left messages, can't get a real person on the phone and by the time they answer my email it will be too late. Missing my friend's baby shower today because of PMC. Thanks guys. Today is a day I'll never get back. Not the 1st time, typical PMC. You guys suck."

Being newly moved to Santa Barbara into a 60 year old house that had an old shake roof and extensive termite and dry rot damage, we quickly learned that there are unscrupulous businesses in the area. We were limited by our HOA on the type of roof we could install. We got 4 bids from local roofers for the exact same roof and damage repairs. Two of the so-called ""best"" roofers in town wanted to charge us THREE TIMES more than the 2 other bids. We decided to hire Quality after talking to Robert. He was courteous, did not try to rip us off and even offered to cover some of the dry rot repairs if we hired him. We were not disappointed. The workers showed up on time, cleaned up every day, and the job was finished on time. It's been 2 years and we have not had one, single problem.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"At first I was skeptical about using an apartment locator agency when moving to Nashville this past month. I've moved several times within the past 10 years from VA, to DC, to TX, (military) then Nashville, so I felt like I knew what I was doing when finding a place to live. And then, when I found this service was free to the customer, I became slightly even more doubtful. However, I decided to give it a try before making my final judgement. My Nashville locator was Kolleen. After meeting her, all my preconceptions went away. She took what I had in mind with points of interest, location, commute time to school, and more importantly, my budget. She did such a great job in assisting me for finding a place in Nashville and was not pushy towards a particular apartment complex or a specific location. I felt she truly put my needs first. I would highly recommend using Nashville Apartment Locators, and if you can, ask for Kolleen!"
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Called AATS after the last big storm.  I had lost several branches on multiple trees and was concerned about one falling over.  Josh scheduled me for the following week and came by when scheduled.  We discussed my issues and he made some suggestions.  He was very knowledgeable and didn't try to upsell me on anything.  He was up front about the work that would be done and said he would e-mail me an estimate after he got back to the office.  I received the estimate later that day and it was lower than I had expected.  He let me know that due to the volume of calls it would be about 4 weeks before he could get to me.  I had no problem with that and scheduled the work.  
  The work was done exactly as promised and in the time-frame estimated.  These guys do a great job and I will use them again in the future."

Both the guys work really hard to get this furniture out of here it was a beast and the temperatures are soaring up into the 90s. Junk rescue gave me the best price from all the junk removal companies that I called and their service was Top Notch I would have expected to pay a lot more for what they did for me. Both Mike and Kevin took great care and moving the furniture out of the way so they can get the sofa and loveseat out of here. I had some hanging wall fixtures and they also took those down to protect them boy what a great job. You'll be very satisfied if you use their service and their price like I said it was the best.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"A friend told me about Painted Cabernet. Check the calendar on their website and you can see which painting will be taught each day.   You do not need artistic talent or painting skills.  Once you walk in to the beautiful studio on State Street, before you know it you have a drink in your hand and are wearing a paint smock.  The owners, Maria and Monte, are superior hosts.  The music plays and the fun begins.  You are walked through each step of the painting - you are told how to mix the colors and which brush to use.  Before you know it, the time has flown and you have created a beautiful piece of art!  It is fun to socialize with the other painters and see how each piece of art is different.   There was a good balance of male/female and all ages (over 21).  A highly recommended, affordable, fun and unique adult activity for Santa Barbara!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Stay Away!!!  I've lived in this complex for 3 1/2 years with very minimal problems.  In May 2021 the property was purchased by Ardizzone Enterprises and it has been a nightmare since.
The new management make it clear it is their property' and they will do whatever they want.  The raised the rent over 40% so nearly every tenant, many who have lived here for decades, will be forced to move when their lease terms.  They don't care who they inconvenience as they ""remodel"" the property to the point where I was told I have to leave my apartment for 2-3 days to accommodate THEM.  They also refuse to accept any liability for what may happen while the subcontractors are in my home.  As if that wasn't bad enough, I will lose 2 days pay since I work from home and have no other options.
Life is too short to have a landlord who treats their tenants so poorly.  Find someplace else to live."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I attached a snapshot of my correspondence with pro core agent Richard. Also, the unpaid bill is the water bill which you have to co do with the landlord when renting. We moved before the bill came to us and it took to long to get fw:  when we did recieve it, it had already been paid. All of which was not included in my review of the company because it wasn't relevant. My review was not to try and get my money back. It was to give my experience for future renters. I would have asked for a hard figure on the carpet cleaning in the lease. Taken photos and emailed them the day we moved in and out. I would have insisted on a representitive walking through with us. If I had read this review prior to moving into any rental I would take the proper steps to protect myself and my deposit. I hope my review is helpful and that is why I wrote it."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Worst place I ever lived at. They polish up the front with nice plants but once you walk inside it's a scary movie 5! My hot water lasted 4-5 minutes on a good day. Their property manager is rude and unfriendly. Maintenance is lazy. Getting them to work requires more than Trump in power! I moved in to a broken door, and getting it to lock on the third slam got me a noise complaint! Ridiculously nosy neighbor. Windows are made of clay and cold air is sucked in ( you must have heat on auto 24 hours a day ) to not freeze in the winter. Don't make the mistake of moving here. With electric and water you're looking at nearly 1300 for a one bed. Appliances are out of date. Closets squeak. The dryer is older than my grandmother. They stole my 1000$ deposit and they'll steal yours. Their appliances aren't even worth what they charge for deposit. Look elsewhere. Don't fall in their model room trap."

By the end of the move I still had furniture not able to fit into the truck and so they could not finish moving me for the day since they took so long! When I finally got to my destination I started looking over my furniture and so many pieces were scraped and broken. My antique side tables were not wrapped properly and completely destroyed, just as one example. They told me to fill out a claims form and after all they broke and destroyed I hardly got anything back from them. A complete joke!!!

Only there for one year in which they decided to undergo extreme home makeovers that we had no knowledge of prior to signing the lease. The team had access to our apartment at all times with little to no notice and this lasted the entire lease. We were stolen from twice and sexually harassed by window watchers with their ding dongs whipped out. Coming from termite infested Campus Palms I thought nothing could be worse, but I was wrong. Inconsistent electric bill charges, and greedy corporate move out charges. Parking is a nightmare and towing visits everyday. Wifi was inconsistent- going out for up to two weeks, and this happened several times!

The guy in charge walked over to my home, we walked in the backyard and he said that they could do the service for $35. Funny how on their website all of the reviews and services say $25. Gave me his # and said txt him my email and they would send a quote and set up service. Txt him and he replied he received my info. Never heard from him. Hit him up inquiring about service.

At around 9:30 I receive a phone call from a separate moving company. It seems that College Brothers Moving had completely botched the appointment so they reached out to third party to fill in. They were able to arrive around 10:30, or 2 hours after my initial appointment with College Brothers.

Icing on the cake was I never heard back from college brothers until the day after, when I received an email asking me to rate their performance. 2 stars because at least they found a replacement service to cover for their incompetence. Would strongly recommend you seek help elsewhere."

Boss says "" even if we're vaccinated ""? I say yes, my daughter is too young to be vaccinated and I arranged masking prior to booking. Three times. They called what must've been the head boss, came back and said they can't do the move. I don't think someone who's vaccinated is going to have this much of an issue. Not sure who's going to move us in a day, I'm pretty angry.

We called Paul and they told us it would cost $200. 00 for a new furnace and $150. 00 for replacement of the one. That was a joke.

The cleaners were friendly and professional.I have used many local and national businesses and I am extremely pleased with the service provided by the local Santa Barbara Properties.  Steve was quick to respond and did a great job on our garage door.  He was very professional, courteous, and extremely knowledgeable.  He was also very accommodating to our schedule.  He was very prompt, thorough, and thorough with questions.  I am very pleased with the quality of the work performed.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"We moved an 1100 sqft house with a shop and it completely filled the big truck. It took 3 guys 6 hours. 

Two of the guys were fast and careful with items. One guy was slow and careless, often moving fragile things on his head or upside down. There were too many instances were I grabbed things off the truck with him standing there. Our dresser was badly damaged and other of our furniture arrived missing wheels or required parts.

We are still missing several items: screws to assemble our couch, a 5 ft tall floor lamp, and small pins to assemble our bed.

I've called Fox for weeks about our missing items and I always get the same run around. They collect my name and number and say they'll call back tomorrow. I've never talked to the same person twice, and as you might expect, never received a call back.

I'd love for Fox to get their customer service in order, but at this time I'm recommending people stay away from Fox Moving."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Even though we haven't used our wood-burning fireplace often it had been a number of years since we had the chimney swept out. After reading numerous positive reviews on Yelp and on Nextdoor, I contacted Leslie to set up an appointment. She was very friendly but George was really booked initially but I'm glad I waited. He and Robert showed up yesterday and did an excellent job of cleaning out our dirty fireplace. I had wanted to convert it from wood to gas for some time and already had acquired some of the equipment needed to do so. George happened to have the rest of the equipment needed in his truck so I was able to tack on that project after the cleaning. He works REALLY fast and the price for the cleaning and gas conversion was very reasonable. They put tarps down and kept the area quite clean and vacuumed up every spec of ash before they left. I couldn't be happier and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I had Dust Queen come to my home this past Wednesday to do a full cleaning. They sent a team of 3 ladies who arrived on time within the two hour window I was given the day before. The ladies were polite, introduced themselves, and shook my hand upon arrival. One team member instructed the others what needed to be done and indicated specifics such as wiping down doors, tops of ledges, etc. They were very thorough and efficient and cleaned my 1200 sq. ft. condo from top to bottom in just over two hours (it wasn't really that dirty and its just me and my dog living here). Getting your house cleaned isn't cheap, but I felt for having 3 people here and the good job that they did, I received very good value for what I paid. As a senior who can't bend over and get down and clean toilets and showers like I used to, this is well worth it to have this team come once a month."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I can provide a solid 5 review for Jhonny's pest co. They are professional and do great work. My jobsite involved a big cleanup project underhouse as well as some insullation correction. Jorge and the team were here for two full days. They stayed until the job was done. The thing that most impressed me was their care for my home. They laid down plastic sheeting as a walk way thru my whole home so they did not destroy any flooring. They were so careful to remove any and all trash onsite as well. And did a great job with the clean up. They left little to no evidence that they had ever even been there doing such a messy job. They also set up bait stations and are my pest company of choice from now on. 

I would and do recommend them to anyone that will listen. They are also very trustworthy and good people to work with. Friendly and polite with good customer service at their office as well."

I had to call them to confirm the warranty. I was told that they would not honor it and they did not honor it. I have not received a call back from them since. The first time I called them I was told that the warranty was not available for that time frame. I asked for a quote and they told me that it would take 1-2 weeks for the warranty to be available.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"We hired Reno Heating & Air to replace our nonworking fireplace, which included moving it over on the wall and everything that entailed. We also chose to replace the mantel with a reclaimed wood beam. John went above and beyond with the finishing of our mantel. He proved to be a very talented craftsman by how he hand-stained and finished our mantel to perfection. His crews were always courteous and highly professional. They even stayed late more than once to complete whatever they were working on that day. They took care to protect all surfaces and cleaned up perfectly every time they were here. 

We cannot praise this company enough. John and Katy have built a business that is everything you would want it to be. They are honest, fair, and hard working. From the first appointment to the last, everyone we dealt with was absolutely the best. We will not deal with anyone but Reno Heating & Air and highly recommend them.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Well last year I tried to get my name of if a lease before it renewed. When I got in the office they said it renewed already and the only way to get my name off the lease was to see if the actual tenant could afford it. I knew she couldn't and so I was stuck on there till the lease was up. This year since I didn't hear anything about a lease renewal, I tried to contact the actual tenant that lives there and I couldn't get ahold of them. I talked to the leasing office and they said it was renewed and that they have my signature. I told them that was forged and their only answer is to work it out with the actual tenant. I'm being held hostage in a lease again! 
Do not rent with them especially if u are living with someone because the moment u r gone, they'll let the current tenant force you to stay on a lease. I don't even live there."

The person who answered the phone was very helpful and accommodating with my schedule, and put in a request for me to get the first appointment for the following morning. Our technician, Tom, arrived perfectly on-time. I explained the user error to him, and he was able to get our pilot light started in no time flat. He also talked me through the lighting process so I will be better equipped next time it goes out. I felt silly he had to come all the way out just to light our pilot, but he was super cool about it.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"First I would say, the wording in the contract for pier installation is different than the words spoken by the actual installers. I was to have 7 piers installed, but only 6 were installed. Half way thru the installation I was told I would need to pay and additional $4161. 00. The explanation given didn't make any sense. I was dismay to see what damage was done to my property. Destruction of my landscaping, stairs, yard, outside lighting and patio. The workmanship is the worst I have ever seen. When I requested an invoice and detail explanation for the extra charge, Brian in customer service sent the installers log spread sheet, which made no sense to me. I complained that I paid for 7 piers, but only 6 were installed and that the installer showed me pictures of 6 piers. Brian said he would get back with me. It has been over 30 days and not a word from anyone. I am now stuck with the added cost of repairing what they destroyed."

Please speak to your partner and his daughter, I am sure they would remember my name. I spoke with him on a number of occasions, at least three, that I can think of. And it's funny that you've responded to this review since he blamed you for my problem saying the previous owner only wanted the basement dry for an open house and you quoted the job based on his needs and not necessarily correctly. He also told me you are no longer permitted to evaluate or quote these kinds of jobs. I tried to speak with you since it is your name on the warranty/contract, and that didn't happen. I stopped pursuing the issue with your company because if you didn't get it right the first time I had serious doubts about you getting it right the second time.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"Campus Palms: proceed with caution

This place isn't a one star place but I felt responsible to correct the previous rating.  This place is no longer worth the price. The low quality amenities (textured and thin walls, plexi-glass windows, low quality and loud Washer/Dryer, dirty carpet, cheap furniture) is overshadowed by the termite problem. Termite droppings were found all over our kitchen and bathroom floors, on our dishes, and in our food. When we got the rooms treated, over the next month, THOUSANDS of dead termites started pouring out of the walls and cabinets dying on the floor. With the price increases, this place should be your last choice. 

The common areas are crappy too. Gym is super freaking small!!!! Impossible to use! Computer room is unnecessary and they're slow.

Trash, sewer, and water is combined with ALL UNITS IN YOUR BUILDING and divided by those that are occupied so you have NO GUARANTEE that you're paying for what YOU USED. You also have to pay monthly for pest control and there are bugs in tue apartment that you can't get rid of.

(Who knew the poles were numbered?!)  I filed this claim around mid-day on Thursday. Well, Friday morning at 8am (Yeah, less than 24 hours later!), there was a service truck at the edge of my driveway making the repair!  That evening. LIGHT!  Now, THAT's service!

They are more than willing to take your money but once you need them to actually do something, they suddenly can't be reached. When anyone bothers to pick up the phone, they first begin by offering excuses about how busy they are before switching to outright rudeness at the idea that they should have to do their job. It must be in the company requirements to only hire people who have major attitude problems. This is not just my experience, I spoke with a neighbor about reaching Expert HOA because no one was answering and he told me he had the same experience. Calls are difficult but emails never get answered.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"You use a title agency 1) because you have to, in order to get property transferred properly and 2) to make sure the property is transferred clear of any future issues that will come back and haunt you (to protect yourself)!  

J&A Abstract, and particularly it's owner Julia, are some of the best out there. Julia truly cares about her work and her clients.   Being a real estate investor, I am involved in several deals per year and I trust Julia to protect my interest more than any other title agent out there.  Her first priority is always to make sure that the sale/purchase is legitimate, the title is clear, and there are no unknown outstanding issues that will appear in the future.  There have been deals where I agreed to use the other side's title agency, but I still had Julia check the deal and title out for me.  

Therefore, I highly recommend Julia and J&A Abstract to anyone involved in a real estate transaction or loan!!"

There is definitely a pattern in dissatisfied customers. There should be ramifications to companies that operate like this.   I DO NOT recommend this company. I had a terrible experience!

I called again to check they had my information wrong which led to them not coming in time. They wanted to move me to the next day. Not able to do that they came the day I need but very late. The actual movers did a good job loading my truck. When it was time to pay I asked to speak to a manger to see if I could get some kind of break on the price due to the disaster that went through with them. The lady at the office refused to talk to me and yelled at the mover saying he should not be speaking to her in front of me. I then tried to call her directly to state my issue it conveniently went to voice mail. They are extremely expensive and very unprofessional!!! DO NOT USE THEM!!!

Mike went right to work and able to hold good conversation while completing the job in less than an hour.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Two years ago, we started our remodel with a new fireplace in our great room. The fireplace provider recommended King Bee Construction for demolition, rebuild, and finish work.
We had no idea what we wanted when we gave King Bee a call. Their Project Manager's experience and imagination created a design that we absolutely love and kept us within our budget. The King Bee construction staff's reliability, quality, and friendliness encouraged us to request change order after change order, each adding more and more projects, until we had a great room to be proud of - and all without a single complaint from their efficient and courteous company management staff who kept us continuously aware of where we stood with our budget.
Year two included a new master bath with a facelift for the bedroom and guest bath that gave us the same excellent results. Again, change orders adding additional work were accepted with open arms and imaginative suggestions. We will be using King Bee again this year to give us wood flooring to complete our upgrades."

We were lucky that we could still use the domestic line until they could get back out on Wednesday to do the repair. Eric came at the designated time and completed the repair but would still need to come back the next day to make sure it sealed properly before we turned everything.  Thurs comes and at 7pm Eric is knocking on our door to confirm everything is working.  I was beside myself that he still showed up and didn't come the next morning.

The salesperson told me what I wanted to hear and most of it was BS according to the people who actually installed the product.
Let's just say that I had to pay my first loan payment for solar panels that are not active yet although I was promised everything would be completed by the beginning of the year. This is on top of the FPL bill I just paid.  So I just dished out over $350 this month for power without  working solar.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"Given the repair issues of this place (sinks falling out of countertops, locks breaking, mold growing up the wall), and the fact the maintenance staff is verbally abusive, you might want to know your rights.  We have waited for weeks to have things repaired.  Know that failure to make necessary safety repairs negates the lease.  Feel free to move out people.

Your landlord must make repairs within ten days of the written notice (per A.R.S. §33-1363).

For landlords who fail make repairs within ten days, renters may be able to make use of the self-help repair statute (A.R.S. §33-1363). This allows you to notify your landlord that you will be fixing an issue yourself and deducting the cost from your rent if they have failed to fix the problem after ten days.

If your landlord does not make the repair within the allotted time, you may also have other options. Landlord-tenant laws in Arizona may allow you to terminate your lease or sue for damages under certain circumstances (such as medical bills or paid rent, per A.R.S. §33-1364)."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"If you're looking for an honest, competent and accountable air conditioning and heating unit technician, meet Eric.   He is the owner of A&R.  The storm we had a couple of days ago messed up my air-conditioning unit. I called an emergency air-conditioning technician to come and look at it at night. Despite the fact that my air conditioning unit is less than a year old, this so called technician was more interested in selling me new products and services than actually fixing the problem.  Sure enough, within 24 hours my air conditioning unit stopped working again.

I called my neighbor for recommendations and he immediately suggested I reach out to Eric. Eric came within two hours to diagnose the problem and fixed it within 30 minutes.  The previous technician had apparently messed up all the wires. All I can tell you is that Eric was thorough and very open about his fees.  No hassle, no BS.

Heat in the winter? Don't count on it, it takes 3 weeks to get that turned on. AC in the summer? Don't count on it, they tell you that it's a luxury and that it's ""unfortunate"" that it's hot because it's not being turned on until Memorial Day. The Management is horrific, rude, and exceptionally inexperienced. They treat you like you live in a dorm and that you're not paying rent to live there. The Maintenance is equally as horrible as the management, since they never know what they're doing and there's a good chance that you will have to track them down to do anything or if they do it, it won't be done correctly the first time.

Oh, not to mention the sounds of the state fair train whose tracks are conveniently located within walking distance...which means during state fair week expect to hear a train roll by and toot it's horn (which is a sound probably pretty close the sound of the gates of hell opening) as it passes your building. 

The reason I give this place three stars is because my apartment is nice, the location is awesome, the neighborhood is safe and calm, and the management is nice enough. So there's that."
Home Services,4.0,OR,I wish yelp had the ability to give different star ratings for service vs the people you deal with. 5 stars for Todd but 3 stars for the company. So I met in the middle. I had a very unfortunate experience with the first technician that serviced my water heater and they had to completely replace our system. Lucky the on call person was Todd on the weekend and he was able to get me hot water again by Sunday. Todd was very honest and knowledgable about fixing the problem. Now the company was not as great this time around. I have used them in the past for air with no issues of service but they do seem to come in more expensive than other companies. Paid $280 to just have someone install a kitchen faucet that we already had that took less than 30 minutes and that was with the club discount . Labor is pricey. We started using them because they are able to squeeze you in faster than other companies but it comes at a premium.
Home Services,1.5,OR,"They called me offering a refinance. I   explained that my FICO score was excellent. John Romanow, a ""Senior Loan Officer"" sent me back an email saying my score was only 620 and my refinance was denied. He used an old old score to deny my loan. He failed to explain that all I needed to do was lift the freeze on the credit companies temporarily to access my current FICO score. I called and   reported him and got an apology. 
I have called 3 times telling people to take my name off all e-mail and phone advertising. A week later they still have hijacked my e-mail and their advertising banner keeps showing up on the top of my e-mail e-mail page. They do fraudulent advertising and refuse to honor the removal of advertising despite 3 calls for that request.  They fail to follow the law that allows me to remove my name from ALL advertising.
Once I mad the mistake of contacting this company they are hounding me with contacts.  So buyer be aware!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"This is the best building in all of Tampa. Especially the most visually stunning with its gorgeous architecture. The Views from the units and even the gym are absolutely beautiful. In the management/leasing office, the staff is AWESOME. Debbie the manager, along with employees Jorge & Jason are all very kind, helpful, genuine, and professional. The building is a perfect fit for so many due to the variety of floor plans available. My leasing associate Jorge, helped me get a perfect apartment for me with the view of my preference.... and the front office is so accommodating they even had wood floor placed in the unit for me a few days before I moved in, upon my request. It feels like a 5 star luxury hotel at Element. The new management company is constantly innovating and improving. The downtown lifestyle is amazing at Element. Even a vegan grocery store on the first floor. Lastly, the lobby and concierge desk shows the level of safety and security the building strives for. They also do great accepting your packages and such."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I am a real estate professional.  My seller requested reports of some work done at their home by Right Now Heating and Air.   They continually lied and said my email didn't work, they didn't even attempt to send it to my email.  Today,  I asked for the service report for the 11th TIME! and they sent it to the original email address I gave them but not without upsetting 2 agents, a buyer and a seller.  They told a big lie to my seller and said my email address isn't valid.  Being elderly, they thought I wasn't honest with them.  This has been a catastrophe.  I had them come to my own home last summer.  They are expensive and make a habit of educating you on replacing the air conditioner when it is just a simple part.  I looked up the part which they marked up 400% and charged the service call.  They can keep their 79.00 service call.  Rip Off.!  Read the ratings first."

It was a total scam. I told him I was going to contact the owner and he said he was going to call me back and I was going to call him back. I called him back and he said he was going to go ahead and charge me $250 for the service and to come back and tell me about the service he said he would call me back. I told him I was going to go ahead and pay him $250 and he said that was fine and I had to go back and call him back.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"This was the worst service I ever received. They sent the 3 stooges to my home to move me, a 2bdrm home took them 6 hrs to load which should have taken 3. One guy was on his cell phone on FB. the Second guy was new and confused and the guy in charge was very passive and did not give directions to the other guys, no organization my husband got so upset that they were not organized he start yelling and directing them on how to do there job. The new guy didn't even know how to do a wardrobe box, said he was never shown. chipped my coffee table and dent in my new refrigerator, chipped wall, I could go on and on. Called the Mgr and he was no help at all and argumentative. I moved from TN to MO a year ago and the Movers (FOX) did a great job. they packed my house and loaded truck and it didn't take 6hrs.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"When Milton came out to speak to us and give us a bid we believed everything he told us that he would deliver within the month it was more than six weeks later and as you can see they took the rocks from our garden area large rocks, broke them up into pieces and used them underneath large gaps to hold the fence up and to fill in the gap's. He promised us the moon and did not deliver anything! Terrible on communication once they got our deposit in their hands, and still very unhappy! I would not recommend this company to anyone especially if you have pets! Also promised us they used a much better quality than everyone else in our neighborhood they said everyone else uses that cheap quality aluminum we use a heavy grade, we have gone around our neighborhood and checked with other people and it feels exactly the same lightweight and cheap no different than anyone else's so once again we feel like we were sold a bill of goods and nothing was delivered."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"My dad and I went here to rent a truck to move my brother out of UCSB.  The place was pretty packed with pissed off dads, but the workers made the line move a long quickly.  They got us ou truck, we inspected for damage, ok'ed everything and took off for UCSB.  When we arrived, however, we noticed a huge tear in the side wall of the back right tire that had been there for a very long time (we didn't see it at first because the trucks are parked so close together when you inspect them we couldn't walk down that side).  Luckily, there are two back tires on each side.  My dad and my wife took the truck back to U-Haul for a replacement.  They weren't receptive to helping us at first, but the manager listened to logic (and the fact that they had endangered our lives by letting a truck with a massive tear in the sidewall out on the road) and quickly replaced our truck.  Overall, a good experience."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Before moving in here, I had read a review that said, if you enjoy sleeping, don't move in here. I also read a review that said it sounds like living in a college dorm. I thought perhaps it was just a couple disgruntled tenants and thought I'll be fine. Well I'm not fine. There is NO peace!!!!!!! Cars rolling thru the parking lot at all hours with the radio blasted. Running and screaming everywhere. And as for the actual apartment, the walls are PAPER thin!! You can hear everything! And if you get a bad neighbor, your life will become a living hell. The office says they talk to them but I don't know if I actually believe that since it never stops. Oh and also they literally never answer the phone!! If you're over the age of 25 I'd suggest looking somewhere else because this place is going downhill fast! Unless of course you like that college dorm feel. And listening to puking and drunken tantrums and loud music. Then by all means, this is the place for you!"
Home Services,5.0,CG,"I highly recommend Flooring Direct. We have had an upstairs apartment for a year now and the upstairs one is a nightmare.  The front desk is very busy, and the lobby is packed with people.  When I call in the morning, they can't get me to my door.  I can't sleep at night, and I have to call the office on a Monday to get someone to come out.  When I call the office on a Sunday, they will not answer my phone, and I have to call the office on a Wednesday.  They also charge me $20 for a door lock, and a $100 deposit for a key.  They do not honor their contract, and I am paying $300 a month to them for not responding to my calls.  I have been in a horrible situation for the last year, and I'm happy to say I am paying this company"

I had a lot of questions and concerns about the move.  I wanted to go ahead and purchase the truck and I wanted to make sure it was secure. 

Greg and his crew arrived on time and did a fantastic job.  They were very professional and respectful of my concerns.  They were able to go over everything and fix all of my issues without having to buy new parts or parts.  I would recommend Greg to anyone and would highly recommend them.I had a great experience with GutterGutter.  They were very professional and did a fantastic job.

Home Services,4.0,CG,"We called at noon on a Saturday and they were in the office around 4:30pm and we had an hour and a half to get to the office. After a very long wait, we were told we were outside in a rental car. This is a very short window of time to get to the office and it took several attempts to get to the office. After asking for a key, they tried to charge us for the hour and a half that I had to wait for to get back to the office. I called the office and was told the office was closed and I had to wait for the office staff to call me back. I was told they would be here until 8:30am.

They also responded promptly and did a great job on my garage door.  They did a great job with installing a new door and on my new garage door.

Then days later we wake up to people arguing at 2AM and 2 nights after that more gun shots. Don't know where these ones came from. When we contacted the office to request to break our lease because we felt unsafe they denied it and said it was going to cost us over $3,000 to break the lease. We even tried to contact their corporate office Amp Residential sent multiple emails and left multiple  messages and they still to this day have not responded to emails or calls.

The process was efficient, organized and very professional. What an outstanding business Sanchez & Co. are running at their new location on S.Howard Ave next to Starbucks. My questions and needs were always addressed. The process for me at first was a bit nerve racking as I've never bought a home or thought I could but Sophia really understood what my wants and needs were. Practically everything was digital (e-mail and text communication, digital signatures I could do from my laptop or phone, and that was really big for me because I could always have written record of what we said because I had to research and assure myself I was correctly reading and understanding the industry jargon. If given the opportunity to change anything - I would've only got to contact Sanchez & Co sooner! Thank you Sophia and Arman for your time and help in my first time home buying experience =)"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Worst experience ever! Paid extra thru C and S (RTA dealer) so I wouldn't have to deal with shipping any damaged or defective cabinets back. Paid $15 per cabinet to have them assembled by C and S for same reason. Note: they do not deliver. Red flag! After picking up cabinets ( a week late due to back order) I was appalled by their condition! Every cabinet but 2 were damaged and or defective. They almost look used! They certainly are poorly made with cheap materials i.e. staples and tiny screws in brackets. (Forevermark cabinets). There are manufacturing defects like not sanded edges, poorly painted. They offered to flip some doors and drawers over so I wouldn't see the defects. Seriously?  After a month of numerous calls, emailing pictures and descriptions to send to Forevermark for approval  ( everything I paid extra to not have to deal with) I am still waiting. I would not in good conscience recommend this company or their products to my worst enemy! I have purchased better cabinets at Home Depot for my pantry!"
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Our loan was transferred to PHH.  We routinely pay a few months ahead and make principal only payments to drive down the loan and reduce the term.  When it was first transferred, in spite of selecting principal only payment, they held the payment in reserve to be applied to the next payment several months out.  After two phone calls they finally rectified and applied as originally requested.
They have now implement an ""improved"" on-line payment system.  This system does NOT have any option to make a principal only payment.  The only options they currently provide are 
 1. mail in
 2. pay by phone.  This option comes with a ridiculous charge of $17.50.  We finally received this answer after two email and two LENGTHY phone calls.  
As a result, we have begun the process to search for a new mortgage company and expect to be rid of PHH by years end.

We had to take our dishwasher to a local cleaning shop for a service call. They had no idea what was going on with the dishwasher, which was a concern. I was so upset that I called to complain, but I was told by the service manager that it was a very old dishwasher and that we would be charged the same. I called the service manager again, she said that we had to call them to get the dishwasher fixed, but we would have to wait a week to be charged for service.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"5 stars for excellence management,  communication,  service and quality.  Yelp made it easy to find the apartment community and it was an easy decision.  
Although I stayed there for less than a year, through the COVID 19 times, the staff were always eager to help and were supportive.   
There is a large pond behind the property, next to the tennis courts. There's a walkway along the pond which can be nice for running as well.   The property is at a walkable distance from Upper Tampa bay park. 

Parking felt a bit limited if you lived around the front facing buildings, but there were always more parking at the back of the property. It has a pool centrally located behind the office, a well equipped gym. The apartments are well built, very spacious and the overall property was nicely maintained.  
Even leaving the Sedona as my lease ended was a comfortable experience and Management really made it easy for me.  Hoping that it stays the same way, I will highly recommend the Sedona."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I moved in here at the beginning of November 2018 and have loved it so far. The location is great and only minutes from downtown. I travel for work frequently and love that the garage is gated to keep my vehicle safe while I'm gone. It seems like there is always some type of community event going on and all of the residents have been friendly. There is also a great free coffee bar with coffee/espresso/cocoa/etc. The best thing so far to me has been the employees. The office staff and management really make an effort to learn your name and are always super easy to get in contact with. When you submit a maintenance request, maintenance calls you before they show up to let you know what time they plan to arrive. They are super polite and clean up any mess once they have finished the repair. You can definitely tell that 909 Flats hires competent, friendly professionals who know what they are doing and how to run a business. I'm looking forward to the summer and enjoying the nice pool."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Excellent in all respects!

We moved from Tucson to Sahuarita yesterday and Soto lived up to their excellent reviews. Jason, Pj and Robert arrived exactly on time and proceeded to load our belongings carefully and efficiently. They were courteous and friendly and made  our move a pleasant experience instead of the stressful event it can easily be. They also went  down the block and up 2 flights of stairs to get some furniture from a neighbor who was also moving.

When we arrived at our new home they unloaded our belongings just as carefully and cheerfully placed them exactly where we requested. before they left they made sure we were 100 per cent satisfied. 

Should we ever have to move again or know someone who is moving i would not hesitate to use Soto and i would certainly recommend them to friends and neighbors, We have used various movers over the years in Seattle and Tucson and these guys were the best. Its so rare to find a combination of great service and fair prices. These folks have both.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"When I replaced my windows and my front door in my house a couple of years ago, I shopped all over town, looking not only for good prices, but windows that would fit the character of my house. I wanted to go for a vintage look, with the two vertical bars on the top panel of the window, instead of the regular paned windows I had before (even though they were original to the house). I also wanted a door to match, in all glass, because my living room was very dark.

I shopped at Home Depot, Lowes, and several other window and door merchants in town. I found prices that were sometimes (especially in the case of the door) three times as much as Central Woodwork charged. The wait times to special order were also ranging from four to eight weeks. 

Christie, the very helpful salesperson at Central, helped me through the whole process and ordered everything for me and found me the best deal in town. Everything went very smoothly and I would highly recommend them for any window or door needs."

The tech told me that he wasn't allowed to bring the equipment (that would fix the problem) into the house per company policy. So I called Rescue Rooter who came out, pulled the toilet (using the electric snake which Hers and His had but wouldn't use), and fixed the problem for $300. Why should I pay $100 for a company to tell me what I already knew??  What a SCAM!  You are a plumbing company, FIX the plumbing issue or don't claim to be a real plumbing company. Tech told me to just sign the paperwork and his company would talk to the Home Warranty company and work it out. I received an invoice in the mail for the $100."
Home Services,4.5,OR,Look Tim based off of the reviews on moving help.com. I never received a call I waited until 1 PM before I started calling him and could not get him to answer the phone. I left a message and waited about an hour still no call back. Was it until I called several times and sent several text messages that he finally answered the phone and told me that he would not be available and could not help me. I told him OK and I was suggesting that he update that information on the moving help.com website in which he hung up on me in midsentence. I would say that he is very unprofessional he said that he did not have his notifications on for the website. Not sure what that means but that's what he said. I would've left this review and moving help.com except I am unable to. I don't know how everyone else had great experiences and I had a horrible one and I mean horrible.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"When my cousin passed away, after an extended illness, it became necessary to move her widower to Senior Living due to his mobility issues and social isolation.  Five Star was the answer to our prayer.  The property is very well maintained.  The apt chosen for him worked well with the furnishings he wanted to take with him.  The balcony on his unit has been the incentive to get him outdoors a bit more.  Maintenance - Mary and Francisco were great in hanging his pictures in the apt where he wanted them.  He has housekeeping once a week. All day dining. Piano Lounge for Happy Hour.   A ""starbucks"" like coffee stop.  So many activities at all different levels.  Transportation.

They did not come out to replace the AC unit, but they did charge us for a ""free"" repair. I had to call the company again to get a quote. They will not be charging us for a ""free"" repair and will not be doing any work that does not have a manufacturer's warranty.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Our Home Warranty Company select this company. Well I can't exactly say company, it's a one man operation. He came out the first time. Stated he Hard Started it. However, there is supposed to be a Hard Start kit attached to my AC unit. Which there is not. The second time he came back out, 3-4 weeks after the first time the unit was making a very obnoxiously loud noise. He said it was a specific part. He would remove it, then order the new part and call when it came in to replace it. However, the 'piece' he took off was square he came back the next day with a round part. Claming it was the right part. He did take off the old 'Piece' he showed it to me. However, that piece was actually not supposed to come off. It was a 'Piece' of an entire part. So I called my Warranty company to have a new contractor come out. They said he absolutely made our AC/heater to the point it was unable to be fixed. It had to be completely replaced!!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Michael Hart CALLED ME about 15 seconds after I filled out a Lending Tree inquiry. He was chatty, chatty, chatty. After almost 10 minutes of chatting, he segues into talking about my job. I mention it's new and that I am doing gig work, and he says ""New like a few years or a few months?"" It's only been a few months so I told him as such. Within three or four seconds, mid-sentence, he hung up on me. It wasn't a disconnection. He straight up hung up on me when he thought he realized the loan wouldn't go anywhere.
If he had any respect at all, he could have told me that unfortunately, two years of tax returns are needed for self-employed people. Then, would have found out that I have several years of self employment history under that same LLC, so even though the work was new, I was surprised to learn that it didn't matter at all. After reading a few nightmare reviews about Royal United, big thanks to MICHAEL HART for treating me like garbage. Rocket Mortgage has been the best."
Home Services,4.0,OR,Overall did a nice job with the sales and installation.  Their service scheduling is very disappointing so be warned.  I set up a Saturday appt a couple of months in advance since waiting for them during the work week is tough for us.  They told me that the earliest appt for a Saturday was June 1st so I took that appt.  Then they call up in mid May saying they have to reschedule until august or later unless i can do it during the week.  I could tell that they were now only reserving Saturday appts for larger dollar installations and my service (their required annual service per their maintenance agreement) was not enough money for them so they pushed me out...note that i bought 2 systems from them in the past couple of years for over $22k.  Moral of the story is you are very important to them prior to your purchase but not so much after!  So nothing very special about this company so if you know of a better one i would go elsewhere.

While the people in the field work hard and have done a good job in the past, the administration and functioning of this company is less than to be desired. The people answering the phones do what they can with their limited autonomy to help customers, however, it seems that it is middle management that seems to get in the way of helping customers. RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!  This person named Carly is antagonistic and refuses to help. She talks over you, and this company would not listen to that fact that my air wasn't working. They blamed it on my filter, which had been recently changed. Wanted me to wait, and my persistence is the only way I could get them out after four days with 80-90 degree heat in my home.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"When they came out to install the fence, they did not complete the job. Said they would come out the next day because they were missing one board. They did not come back the next day and also forgot to put the ground gate latch in which caused the closing gate latch to break and the gate would keep banging into the broken latch in the wind and make a loud banging noise. I could not close the gate, the job was not finished!! Also, the fence was supposed to go further back 2ft, but I let that slide. I had to call every day for about three weeks before they came out and finished the job. And that was only after they received the remaining payment, which I wasn't going to pay until the job was finished, but wanted to get this done with and move on.

The beds were comfortable, the room was quiet, and the kitchen was awesome for making lunches, cooking breakfast and making dinner. I used the workout room, which was perfect for what I needed.

I also cannot wait to use the pool in the summer time. Everything looks great at first glance here, however there are still many issues with this building. We have only been here a few months and have already experienced no hot water, several issues with no heat and smaller minor inconviences. Not to mention the constant sound of smoke detectors going off with low battery signals. 

When issues do arise it seems as if management tries to brush you under the rug and hope you drop the issue. Communication is still lacking. It also seems everyone is concerned with opening the new loft style apartments, when they still should be addressing issues with current residents and our apartments. 

They say the building is 60% full, but it definitely seems less. I hardly ever see anyone in the halls or using the amenities building. 

Overall, I would suggest thinking twice before signing a 12 month lease here."

We were told when we came to see the unit that we moved into that the carpet would all be replaced before we moved in.  Right off the bat, we noticed there is an obvious patch in the carpet where they piecemeal placed a completely different colored carpet.  It is directly in front of the entryway and very noticeable.  I contacted the office the following day.  The manager called back to tell me her ""carpet guy"" was there now, but there is ""probably nothing"" they can do.  There is also a patch of carpet that is completely missing from the corner of the 2nd bedroom closet.  When I informed the manager, she told me by way of an explanation that they probably took the patch that they used on the entryway from the closet, no big deal.  That is not okay.

I was looking to have a 240V - 50amp plug for an electric vehicle installed.  This was going into a two year old home so I was nervous about holes and patches to have this plug installed.  After getting three estimates, I decided on Contact Electric.  Jason was very knowledgeable, had the best price and kept my concerns about the holes and patches in mind.  The biggest plus is that Contact Electric is Tesla certified to do the install.  He is listed on Tesla's website.  The only concern I had was I had difficulty reaching him a couple of times but it all worked out.

1. The office staff are beyond professional and helpful
2. Maintenance will come the day you call or the day after
3. They will replace any old utility, they replaced my washing machine in the blink of an eye 
4. Valet trash service, every night someone comes to my second floor apartment and collects my trash. Awesome. 
5. The pool is like a resort, luxury chairs and a great grilling area. They are also re-modeling the bonfire pit for autumn
6. The apartments look beautiful inside and remind me of home
7. There are constantly people working on the landscaping
8. The apartments are CLEAN and bug free
9. Located on the north-side of Indianapolis, just off the Allisonville and 465 exit, you have access to everything
10. The clientele. Minimal riff-raff, mainly younger working professionals. This is a MAJOR bonus. 

This place is a five star apartment complex. Thanks so much!

I received several quotes giving the scope of the job and he can back and matched one of the quotes.

There were general stains, pet stains, dirty high traffic areas, etc...  He was able to clean ALL stains.  I was truly amazed at how clean the carpet was when he finished.  The cleaning didn't take very long, and the cleaning products are safe for pets, so I didn't have to figure out how to keep the pets off of the carpet for 24 hours, which would have been impossible!

Tried calling the office several times and no one answered, instead an answering machine picked up to say they were busy and to leave a message.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"Unfortunately, our apartment complex 712 Tucker (a Nordblom company) in Raleigh uses Valet Living for trash removal. As residents, we are forced to pay for their services each month, however, their services are spotty. Typically, they are supposed to pick up trash every night, unless the trash is lose or overflowing. However, at least once a week they decide not to pick up our trash, and instead leave passive aggressive notes and email our apartment complex to tell them how our trash was not suitable to be picked up. We ensure each night that it follows every single rule that Valet Living has set, so why they decide against doing the one job they are hired for, is beyond me. To add insult to injury, when they decide against doing their job and leave our trash out, we get fined from our apartment complex. Its such an easy job to do well, so it is frustrating to see them stoop to such low levels. If you're an apartment complex considering using Valet Living's services, I'd highly recommend reconsidering so that your residents are not as frustrated as we have been."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I have to say Air Hawk has exceeded our expectations once again. Our AC died on Sunday night, the night before 4th of July. We contacted Air Hawk. The next morning, Joe, the owner showed up to take a look at our AC. Who shows up on a holiday, on 4th of July? Air Hawk does! We were so impressed. It has been close to a year since we had Air Hawk watching over our dying AC. They did necessary repairs over the months to make it last. We were always very satisfied with their honest work. This time, after doing the diagnostics we realized it was time to replace our whole system. Air Hawk helped us from start to finish, from deciding on pricing, financing. They offered us three price ranges to choose from. Working with Air Hawk is a breeze. Their response time is amazing. We had our AC (Air handler and Condenser) replaced by them. They did an excellent job. The techs were very professional and were knowledgeable. We are very happy with the work they performed. If you expect quick, reliable honest work, choose Air Hawk!"

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I recently had Joanna clean a rental tenants had moved out of (which was left pretty gross, especially with dog hair). She met me in advance for a quick 10 minute meeting at the property so she could give an accurate price for the whole rental to be cleaned (very reasonable price for that matter and very close to what she quoted me via Yelp by just reading a short description of the place). The place was left SPOTLESS. Joanna and her team worked hard to make the place look brand new. She got stains out of the bathroom, all the of pet hair was essentially gone, and stains on the walls and ceilings were also gone. At the end, she made sure I was satisfied with everything before  accepting payment. She literally moved appliances out of the way to get all the nooks and crannies cleaned in the place! 
Joanna is very prompt with responses and does a great job. If you've never used a cleaning service and are looking for someone local to use, contact her! She will make sure your place is looking great."

The counters tops in the kitchen had grime on them and any hard to reach place in the bathrooms were not touched. There was also a pile of dirt and debris in our closet that was not swept up. Not only was the house not clean there were new scratches and scuffs on our hardwood floors. Please do not waste your time and money with this company. They do not care about the quality of service provided by their employees. They gave me a small refund that does not at all okay the pictures I was able to provide for them.

And to freeze my account would cost more than a  termination. 

This morning I discovered they turned off my WiFi two weeks early and in the third week of my billing cycle.  

So now my choice is return the modem today for 44.00 Or turn it back on and follow original plan and pay 84.00

So, logic tells me to let it go and save two twentys. 

If I restart I ll come back as a new customer and get the new client package

A lot of effort just for a signal. 
Update
They open at 11 and only allow 2 in at a time. Diff work stations , you stand six feet from the desk. 

You pay by credit card or debit. No cash accepted.

They were quick to diagnose the issue and straightforward when it came to pricing, honoring the Yelp referral discount referenced on their page. They returned on Monday to complete the job at the beginning of the window of when they said they would be there - no waiting! They even beat me home!

Ernie and I apologize for forgetting the other installers name did a fantastic job putting in my new system which I love and is much more efficient going from a Leer of maybe 8 or 10 to a 16.

These are 1 way streets but I have encountered several situations with people driving the wrong way and my car has been side swiped while parked in front of my apartment.  I lived in a 2 bedroom townhome and it worked well for me, minus the fact that it was 3 stories and both bathrooms were on the 3rd floor.  But, I knew this before I moved in.  I enjoyed the pool and fitness center.  My biggest complaint was management.  Anytime I entered the office, I felt like a burden.  I was treated rudely on several occasions and this really bothered me, as I was always very nice to them.  I paid a lot of money to live there and expected to be treated better...or at least greeted with a smile.  Maintenance was great.  They were always friendly and prompt.

He drew pictures, showed pamphlets, down graded competitors and went on so hard with his pitch I was ready to ask him to leave. He had 5 different quotes a couple of which were double what the other company's quoted! Then he called his boss(like a car salesman) and put him on the phone with me to try to get me to buy today! I have had two followup calls in two days and finally just told them I went with someone else, Do Not call me again!

Home Services,2.5,OR,"Sila just completed a great high velocity system on our 85 year old home. We had six different HVAC vendors come through, and no one but Sila could come up with a solution to running the necessary duct work with minimal impact to the historic details of the property. Another local HVAC expert in older home installations called them 'the best', so we went with Sila. Brian was our representative, and he was highly professional throughout the process, working with us and keeping in regular contact. Hung and the installation crew was professional and clean, leaving almost no trace of their work. There was a slight hiccup with the planning of our system, which necessitated that we get a larger system than originally expected and took us slightly over budget. That is the only reason for four stars instead of five. That being said, they did give us the system upgrade at cost and threw in the carpentry work for free. All in all, a very positive experience and I wouldn't trust anyone else with a complex installation on an older home. It isn't cheap though, but you can't beat the quality."

The pool area is dirty, moldy, tiles are missing, etc. And it's been like that for over 5 months. The sprinklers are constantly leaking pools of smelly water all over the complex, and most are directed at sidewalks so you constantly get soaked trying to walk to your apartment.

I offered to provide photos showing the damage but management was not interested. When I called the manufacturer to see if any of this was covered under my warranty and described the damage, they advised me this could have only been done if the mattress was folded or the ratchet straps were too tight.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"I've lived at the Marott for about 7 months now and do not have enough positive things to say about the apartment building.

My only real complaint is the amount of false fire/emergency alarms there have been over the past 6 months - including one in the middle of the night. The only other thing I'm not a huge fan of is the freight elevators in the back of the building - they're slow and often stop at every floor even if you're the only rider. 

The rent is reasonable for a one bedroom for essentially being downtown - parking is free, a drive to work downtown is approx. 10 minutes and there's also a bus stop right outside. 

Other great things - indoor/outdoor pool, sauna, hot tub, small but decent work out room, coffee in the Business Center and a friendly concierge staff. The maintenance is responsive and helpful. 

I've definitely been very happy with my time at the Marott and I will likely renew my lease. I've always felt safe around and in the building despite the not entirely safe location and I think it's a great place to call home."

Aaron is seriously THE MAN. He showed up day-of to assess the situation and explain the process and costs. The next day he was back and ready to work. He was so professional and clean throughout the whole process, you could tell he was in his element - doing everything with an immense amount of attention to detail.

I've included the before-and-after photos, and they speak for themselves honestly. They still need a fresh coat of paint (but that's on me as I'm trying to find the correct one), but I'm blown away by his craftsmanship. I don't even see them anymore, it's like they never happened!

I said that would be fine as long as they replace my old one. She said, NO. So, I'm not getting my money back. I am filing a complaint with the BBB, as well as taking them to small claims court, and calling the consumer reporter for our local news station. I would hate for this to happen to someone else. Btw, the technician also added the pulse to my account without getting my permission."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Don't do it.  Even a pig can look good w/lipstick and trust me, you're seeing a lot of lipstick when you're first shown around.  Just wait... the fees, the rules, the inconveniences, the pop-up ""smoke detector inspections"" on a regular/monthly basis.  My friends/family who came to visit, said it seemed like I was living in a prison camp/nazi germany, as I always had to pass on/advise of a new do/don't list so as not to break any NEW rules, because yeah, on a regular basis you find notes all over about this or that new rule.....it's ongoing and on complete violation of tenant rights, since you abide the rules of your lease, but they keep changing/adding new rules, trust me, when you're an adult and you feel like you're back living in your parents home, with big brother always watching.  A decent apartment is not worth the headache it takes to live there and follow ALL their rules.  P.S.  You will never see your security deposit back, they will find a way to keep all or at least a large portion of it.  You've been warned."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Customer service is so bad here. I should have known better as I called with questions about covid sanitation and protocol and the women on the phone was literally sighing which is only to be topped by the actually eye rolls witnessed by the staff and if that's not bad enough I heard housekeeping talking ill of the staff to be fair they thought they were discreet as they weren't speaking English. 

As many other reviews point out, the amenities are dated, the restaurant is awful (see their menu online; I feel I was warned about this), the prices are inflated, and ongoing construction is a problem. Wireless internet is often too slow to use; I generally gave up trying. The fitness center lacks a pool. The rooms are comfortable and reasonably well-appointed, but not for the price. The breakfast and happy hour available if you stay above the 9th floor are nice touches, and the staff is generally friendly and helpful. It's a comfortable night's sleep. The location is convenient to downtown or west Nashville, and especially to Vanderbilt. It just isn't worth nearly $500/night with parking, internet, and various fees included."
Home Services,3.5,CG,I had a huge Dateline issue and needed to make a call back to my landlord. I called two different people and the most recent one said the service was not working and that he had to call me back. I called the previous owner and he said that the service was not working. I called another company and they said the service was not working and that I needed to call back. I called another company and they said they had an update on the service. I called another company and they said they had a technician out and he was coming out to do a repair. I called another company and they said it would take at least one hour. I called another company and they said it would take 3 hours and I would have to call back. I was shocked and went back to the previous owner and said I was never told of this. I was very upset and I was not even in the service area.

Unfortunately this is not the case. We have been getting the run around as to when our property will be delivered to us. We have called numerous times and several people have transferred us to voice mailboxes that are full and never allow us to speak to an actual manager. Jennifer is the most disrespectful operations manager I have ever dealt with- this is the most unreliable company I have ever had to deal with. They are not even going to honor their 21 day contract!

Even when requesting to speak to the broad of directors there is no response. NEVER USE THIS COMPANY!

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Buyer beware!  I own a 500 sq ft apartment and needed some electrical work, I regret calling Olectric. The electricians told me that they lacked access to the ceiling, and they would need to cut a hole. I accepted the recommendation of the professional, and approved the cut out. The electrician cut one hole, and then came back to cut another. Cutting the hole twice imposed a greater cost on repair. At the end of the day the senior electrician informed me that they found ceiling access in the closet, and cutting the hole was a mistake. Olectric refuses to offer any remittance for the damage caused to my property. The Olectric PoV is that I should know better than their electricians with regard to access points available within a 500 sq. ft. apartment. My concern is for my tenant on a 100 degree day, and I simply did not know about the ceiling access point. While I did not know, Olectric made no effort to inspect the unit effectively before recommending the action, and imposing meaningful damage to our property."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I've lived in Philadelphia for 20 years, and am accustomed to things not working exactly as they should in this city. Not the case with ABF U-Pack!  

First, they gave me a quote for my move to New Orleans that was significantly less expensive than PODS, with no deposit required. They were happy to deliver three cubes ""just in case"" we needed the third one, with no extra charge if we only used two (which turned out to be the case). I was nervous about getting the permits for the cubes - we had to place them in metered parking spots -  but ABF handled all of that with no extra fee. The cubes were delivered exactly when they said they would arrive, and picked up promptly. My only complaint is that no one mentioned that the company takes Good Friday as a holiday until I called to schedule the pickup:  we had to hustle a bit to make the Thursday pickup. I have never written a Yelp review before, but I was so impressed with ABF U-Pack that I wanted to spread the word."

Whenever the line gets too long or someone can't get in, they just let them in no matter who they are. Not like it really matters though, the gates are broken 60% of the time anyways. I've woken up to gunshots on multiple occasions. I also have a friend who was in a domestic violence/rape situation here and the management absolutely refuses to break the lease for her. Even with a restraining order the best they can do is move her to a different building - like that will help anything. There is a very greedy attitude when it comes to management. Bottom line- it's not safe here.  

The maintenance crew is absolutely incompetent. Between my roommates and I, we have put in FIVE work orders to repair the dishwasher and even though they say it has been unclogged, it still floods the kitchen whenever we attempt to use it.

- FREE PARKING!!!! The garage is just a block away but its a blessing in the city. Free street parking at night and on weekends. 
- The gym had a great trainer and 2 workout classes every week. Enough equipment for those who want to workout by themselves. 
- Monthly happy hours (Never heard of a building doing this)
- Majority of the residents are doctors / med students and young professionals.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"Originally found them on Angie's List, but following reports that A.L. may not be as unbiased as implied, I have since allowed that subscription to lapse. 

Have used Murray Resnick plumbing twice and hoped the first experience was an anomaly. It is important to understand that we were not on-site for either job.  These were two separate and distinct jobs. 

I'd give his wife 5-stars for her pleasantness and timeliness of appointment - and Murray 5-stars for showing up roughly as scheduled. Also, 5-stars for his work and cleaning up after himself. His price is on the higher side, 3-stars, but everyone deserves to make a living. 

Where I have had frustrations is (Murray did not head out until he secured credit card details) when his work is completed, Resnick Plumbing falls out of sight: no invoice (or receipt, I suppose), we had to log into credit card account to determine the charge, no returned phone calls. I wish it were otherwise, but instead of feeling I've been treated as a valued customer...well, I just don't. To follow up with a receipt or returned phone call would have resulted in a wholly positive review."

After hours of trying to get the faucet nuts off without success I got on Yelp and started searching.  I called at least 3 plumbers on the top of the list before reaching out to HIP.  None of the others answered and none have called me back 24 hours later.

I told them to let me know when the repairs are finished and I will pick it up. I kept checking my Tesla app but nothing showed up. I finally received a text at 3:17 pm that the tesla is ready for pick-up. I picked up the car after hours. After all that the only thing that they repaired was the charge port. The customer treatment is horrible at best. Buy a Chevy or for that matter a Kia you will get better customer service.

We found Drew Lawless in Yelp, met him to get an estimate on our condo. High ceilings, open duct work and girders, removing wall paper (it turned out to be contact paper!), and covering some dark colored walls and awful wall mural designs were the challenges. We were impressed with his understanding of what we wanted and his attention to detail, so we agreed to go ahead with him. He recommended paints to match the colors we wanted and made excellent recommendations on what color to use where. He showed us samples on the walls, so we could better decide which colors we wanted. 

On time and on budget the work was completed a few days later. Two bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, hallway and foyer. As we wanted, chair rails were removed, without a trace. Other fixtures (electric switch covers, shelving, curtain rods, etc) were removed and replaced per our requests, all professionally, cleanly and without any damage.

Drew and his crew were immaculate, efficient, and delightful to work with. They left the apartment spotless and looking fresh and airy. I would definitely recommend Lawless painters to do any painting work you need."

This is the worst experience I have had on a business and personal level! My exit and final inspection was a nightmare, I was deducted over $200.00 dollars from my deposit due to floor cleaning that was not stated on the contract--I was charged for garage flooring clean up (what is that?) never heard of that in my life!  I lived in a 1100sqft home and it was about $200.00 for the service who by the way was an out of town company from northern AZ?! I tried contacting the broker, he would not return my phone calls and writes me a letter instead of having the proper etiquette to speak directly to me.  Margaret attacked me personally after she saw that I made a comment that she is a pain to work with...I was going to be sued by her apparently.  I have experience in the Real Estate field and I have never in all my career experienced a company so unprofessional.

I am a relatively young tenant and the level of unprofessionalism is ridiculous. I was walking into my building and was stopped and asked if I lived here (been here for sbout 2 years). The leasing office staff is also TERRIBLE, which is a big no-no for any type of business. I walked into the leasing office to fill out some paperwork required for my vehicle and the woman said ""and who are you"" and once I calmly said I was a tenant, she said ""oh, you look really young."" My displeasure with this place isn't limited to what I wrote. The list is extensive. I've never been late on rent and I've never given them any issues. They don't really maintain the building aka it's filthy and amenities are never running properly so for almost $900 a month, what exactly am I paying for? Their attitudes and overall business presentation are disgusting.  I definitely will not be renewing my lease. They need to learn proper business etiquette.

Lisa the property manager likes to blame the residents for all the issues and I have put 2 calls into her boss Barbara with no response.  My current situation is that my upper bathroom is sitting with sewage backup in both the toilet and shower and I am unable to get a response or cleaning from Mills.  As a resident who is set up with autopay for my rent and has had no issues, you would think they would try to take care of you, just a little.   I have decided to quit paying my rent at this point and head to court if needed.

Ample parking. The office lady was nice. The unit we had apparently is managed by a separate company and we had to go down the road to get the keys. There was a convenience store across the street that was nice to have so close. I gave it 3 stars for a couple reasons. The elevators were disgusting and smelled terrible-I was seriously gagging every time I was in either of them. There was a group of woman who would go down early in the morning and put 1 towel on every lounger on one side of the pool but then would go to the beach and no one could use the loungers. The hallway on floor 1 was dingy and seemed like a rundown apartment. One of the dryers in the laundry area didn't work right. Check-out was crazy because people would hold the elevators (we gave up and carried all our luggage down the stairs). I would have expected better for what we paid."

So I asked the person on the phone about our concerns and she promised to check with whoever and would return my call.  A couple days later I called back and the same person told me that someone else would call with answers the following day and I never heard anything more.   This was a 6K project and they couldn't return my calls and had no time for me for 5 weeks.  Assuming they are really busy with bigger and better customers and have to prioritize resources just telling me they weren't interested and not bothered giving me an estimate would have avoided wasting their time on me.  One could complain about customer service but I never got to be a customer. The one good thing was the people who did the job matched their price.  So, thank you, Sonoran Retractables."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"We remodeled our home last year and our general contractor hired Willow Wood to refinish our hardwood floors. They looked beautiful... One of my absolute favorite features of the house! Unfortunately, a few months later, we found a patch of flooring in our master bedroom where the finish appeared to be bubbling. We called Will and he promptly addressed the issue. A few months after that, we found another spot in the hallway. Again, Will was quick to make repairs. When we found a third and fourth spot, he offered to refinish the floors again. Obviously, there was a defect in the finish that was applied and Will worried that we would continue to have issues. I can't say enough good things about Will's exceptional customer service. Not only did he refinish the floors (they look awesome, by the way!), but he even hired professional movers to help us relocate our furniture before and after the job and painters to touch up the baseboards, all at no cost to us! 

In short, Will went above and beyond to get our floors right and make us happy! He takes tremendous pride in his work and it shows. I highly recommend Willow Wood!!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"ZERO STARS!!! This is absolutely the worst apartment complex to rent from in Reno. I lived in these apartments when they were still Hillview Terrace/Comstock Hills (I was in high school w/ family) & moved back on my own when I was 24 just a month before the complex was bought by tHe VeRgE...  I loved living here -that's why I came back. I realize it was a HUGE MISTAKE. 
The company that owns this complex consists of a bunch of irresponsible, greedy, misleading a**holes! They will raise your rent & break your lease contract if you're not paying attention. They try to fee you for no good reason. They charge you for bullsh*t services, even if you never use them. They've raised the rent so high that you end up paying luxury apartment prices for dilapidated units built in the 80's. They have no morals i.e. I moved in with a reasonable price so in order for them to get more money I'm not allowed to sign a lease longer than 5 months just so they can jack up the prices every time my lease is up!
This is what's wrong with Reno! The Verge is ruining my home town!"

We have had to unfortunately make a noise complaint about one neighbor and they promptly handled it. That was our only issue and now that we have moved into a top apartment we have been fine. In fact, we are friends with most of our neighbors. I agree with another comment that if you wanted family or friends to stay for a trip that there is plenty of parking for them. I do see the one star review about the brown recluse issue and to be fair that was not just this apartment complex that was afflicted that summer into fall. That was reported in the whole surrounding area. If you spray bug spray at least once a month around the apartment it will keep the spiders out. We no longer have them.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I moved from Bloomington, Indiana, to Lynchburg, Virginia, with the help of U-Pack. Overall, the experience was fine. Customer service was very different in each location. Staff in the distribution office in Indianapolis (where our relocubes were delivered from) had difficulty finding our reservation, acted as if they had never spoken to me each and every time I called, and, most significantly, could only give me a 12-hour window during which our cubes would be dropped off (and during which I had to be home waiting on them). The actual delivery person was very helpful and gave me several tips on how to pack the cubes and distribute the weight of the items. On the Virginia end, our full cubes were delivered from the Roanoke office. Staff in VA were much friendlier and, importantly, much more informed about when the cubes would arrive. Rather than having to be home from work an entire day, I had a window of time in the afternoon when I knew they would arrive. Overall, my items were in good shape when they arrived. Take note of U-Pack's recommendations, and be sure to use blankets, plastic wrap, and other packing materials to protect and secure your items."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Short Version: Don't bother with Home Depot and use these guys. Incredible to work with from start to finish. 

We had originally planned on using Home Depot to put in laminate flooring in our 1300 sq ft condo. Home Depot came out, ripped up the carpet, and essentially walked off the job after they saw some humps in our subfloor. On top of that, they suggested to us that we should contact a structural engineer to review the subfloor because there could be serious issues. I'm not expert, so I took their word on it...after a few days, I figured I'd call L&L and have them come out and see what they think. 

From the first phone call, Nick and his team were incredible to work with. He came out and assured me that the humps in the subfloor could be fixed with self-leveler, and their quote came within the original Home Depot price range. There is ZERO reason why anyone should use Home Depot for renovation projects, and I won't make that mistake again. 

Their team did an incredible job from start to finish. The floors look great, and they even went back and fixed parts that weren't initially installed correctly."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I hardly ever write reviews, but the experience was a comedy of errors, and I'd hate for others to endure the same experience. We made a cross country move, our move was door to door, so packing was included.
The packers were careless with boxcutters, a boxcutter was left in our front the yard and another in our bed. 
Mass confusion aroused because of the exercise equipment. The packers didn't have the tools, neither did the movers on moving day, and neither did the driver. Each group said the next would take care of it. In the end, we scrounged around the neighborhood looking for the correct tool, the part was placed on the truck without the tag, then when we arrived at our destination the part was lost. 
The truck also arrived three days past the window, and when the truck arrived items were damaged because they were not packed properly. (example: bending an unbendable bed frame, placing heavy items on a lightweight bookcase, handles snapped off of a weight stand, lost exercise equipment.)
So, if you're considering using L and J movers, I suggest you look elsewhere. I've moved cross county two previous times, and this was the worst experience I've had."

Doing so was going to require removing what felt like 4,000,000 feet of dated wallpaper. I don't mind wallpaper, but THIS wallpaper had to go.

Spencer came out to give us a quote quickly, and said he could start the job in a few days and have it finished in a few days. We heartily accepted. 

When Spencer and his team arrived on a Wednesday morning, they rapidly got to work. They took great care to protect the hardwood floors and the drywall under the paper, while rapidly showing that yucky 90's wallpaper who was boss. 

To my utter delight they finished ahead of schedule. I was astonished and thrilled! I am so grateful to Spencer and his team for their professionalism and quality.

I called John at about 4ishpm the day before the move and requested a change. He was very accommodating but i was charged a cancellation fee of $200. Which i expected as I called quite late in the day. The movers were scheduled for 9am on the Wednesday. They arrived at 8am, which was fine but I was still packing the last few items. They arrived ( 3 guys) and brought moving blankets and plastic. They wrapped some of my furniture and used blankets to cover some items as well. By about 12ish the move was done. They even took apart my bed frame and re-assembled it in the new house. They assisted with setting my tv on its stand as well. Nothing broke, nothing was damaged, everything arrived in one piece. They handled all my belongings with care.  They did a great job and i would definitely recommend them."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"If there were ever a chance to rate a company 0 stars, it would be for Riverlake (University) Properties. 

I have lived here for one year and am shocked that they are still in business. The house is filthy- even after the MANDATORY $900 fee and four delayed move in days for a cleaning service. One of the toilets has had trouble flushing on maybe 7 separate occasions, and not once did maintenance appear the same day of the call (even if the call was placed at 9 am). There is no storage space in my home for dry foods, and only one of four stovetop burners works. The air conditioner does not have an off button, so who knows how much extra money utilities have costed. Termites have recently entered my bedroom from an unknown location. Rent is much too high for the quality of the home, and don't expect your deposit to be returned. I feel bad for the next group of four to move into this house.

I can think of two small pros: 
1) the maintenance workers they send are always very pleasant.
2) the office workers are pleasant when trying to help you (but don't write down most of your concerns)"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I had a plumbing leak under my slab and called this company out of the phone book. They arrived promptly and told me that they could replumb the house in 3 days that was June 25th, 2018. The plumber Al, said that I needed to pay him when he started the work but the check would not be cashed until the work was completed. The check was cashed almost immediately and the work was never completed. It went on for 3 plus weeks with Al lying about the current situation at the house which was a rental. He also texted and called my tenant with very foul and inappropriate language because she had told me what was really going on. This is all documented. Even when someone else from the company was sent out to finish the job, the work was left unfinished and extremely sloppy. I spent several more thousand dollars to get it done right by another plumber. 
Needless to say, I can't emphasize enough how unprofessional this company was, mostly represented by their plumber Al, who lied continuously and almost caused my tenant to move out with his horrible work and foul mouth. 
Do not under any circumstances use this company."

I called again and she said that I was not going to get the call back. I got another call back to say that my service was canceled. I called back and they said that I was still working on it.

The inspector came out and told me that the water heater was working fine.  He stated that the water heater had a leak in the valve and it needed to be replaced.  I was so impressed with the quality of the work that I called the HVAC company and they responded quickly and got back to me within an hour.  The house inspection was done in a timely manner, and I was very pleased with the results.  I highly recommend this company.I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is.  They are the best!

Alicia immediately responded to my online inquiry - even though it was very early in the morning - they had me at Good Morning! 

Anthony came out for the estimate and explained in detail how they would proceed. Eric and his team painted two interior walls as well as our garage doors that also needed weather stripping replaced. Their attention to detail was superb, they have wonderful manners and are very respectful, personable and professional. Eric pointed out some items I had not noticed that they fixed/painted - including an outdoor shutter by the garage doors that should be painted at the same time. Bill the owner also called me to discuss some ordering issues with custom weather stripping. I was impressed that he took the time to go over the details with me. It was a team effort that deserves 5 stars. They GET customer service.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Two employees came to my guest house/office for some repairs in July. Reasonable cost ($75) and pleasant people. However, they didn't properly fix the toilet, so within a week or so, I called to have someone came back out.  The owner came out, took a look & said he needed to go to Naughton's for parts and would be back soon.  After a few weeks, I called again to remind him.  He said he'd come back ""soon"". This has gone on since late July with me calling to remind him to finish the repair & him making an appointment but not showing up. One time, though, he told me he was going on vacation & he told me I'd have to remember to call him when he got back (!) The last time he made an appointment & didn't show up was this week - 4 months after his employees didn't do the job properly.  Unfortunately, the interim fix is neither attractive (off color handle on the toilet) nor durable, so the toilet isn't always working.  I will now have to hire another plumber to fix what his company didn't do properly in the first place & don't appreciate that."

My family is now displaced in a hotel with two small children because a house they are managing is filled with mold and they refuse to fix it properly in a timely manner! They have lied. They send out what they call is a maintenance person and he brings his pregnant girlfriend. The so call maintenance person left rusty nails all over, trash and debris from tearing apart the cabinets and sink. Left it all unassembled. Knowing their were small kids in the home, not that is matters, that shouldn't have been done regardless. The cabinets were so old and in disrepair the front of the door actually fell off by itself and this is what caused the mold to be discovered.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Our apartment manager also uses Sams to extract water from the carpet due to toilet flooding on Monday. I was happy with how fast they send someone out after hours and cleaned the carpet, extracted the water and started the drying process (by using a giant fan underneath the carpet). Fine, if that's what it takes to dry the carpet. Here are the problems: 
1) do not trust when they say they ""will send someone out TOMORROW to check or retrieve their fan."" Because they failed us TWICE. Their fan was in our room blowing underneath the carpet with exposed nails from lifting the carpet up for a WEEK... we had to called them to come get their machine.  This also led to worsening of allergy; not fun. 
2) they do not clean up well. So make sure you're at home when they are in your home and make sure floor is safe.  Our carpet was not closed completely and now we have exposed nails to step on... will need to follow up with management and hopefully we won't get tetanus from these rusted nails.

A friend had recommended her to me as Jenn had represented them when they bought their first home. Not only was Jenn able to schedule showings for me on short notice but she was also able to understand what I was looking for in my dream home and recommend properties accordingly. She stuck with me over the course of many months as we toured a variety of properties in a variety of neighborhoods.

Once we found ""the one"", Jenn helped position me to act quickly, and through her hard work I was able to make the most attractive offer to the buyer. We closed on time with absolutely no bumps in the process, something the seller knew would be the case when working with Jenn, and I can't thank her enough for her services. As a realtor who is also a zoning and land use attorney, Jenn brought a lot of useful insights into the process and helped advise me on where I might potentially be making a bad decision. I'd recommend Jenn and her team to anyone looking to find their dream home in Philadelphia!

Another dissatisfaction is that the office require you to pay for a professional carpet cleaner when you move out. We did and the inspection lady still made us pay extra due to carpet not being 100% clean. Also the amenities within the unit are old and easily broken.

I booked them for a move in a 10' cargo van originally, because I was getting rid of most of my stuff and Mike came by and said it would all fit and gave me a good price. I signed a contract and laid down a $100 deposit. For reasons completely independent of the movers, my husband and I decided to take our own cargo van. We called Mike the day before the move asked him if we could book the movers only for the loading of our van. He agreed, quoted another good price and then allowed me to use the deposit towards the new service.

When they arrived, they were professional and speedy. All they brought with them was shrink wrap, but they still managed to protect everything I had (I had already packed everything) and nothing was damaged during the move.

This was by far our best experience yet and it did was even at a reasonable price.  The original fence we had built a year ago on our current house was really shotty.  It always bugged me to look at it.  In areas it was high off the ground and easy for one of my dogs to do minimal digging to get out.  The wood was not good and in areas it wasn't straight to the ground (the slats).  The gates were not built well at all. We finally decided to tear it down and rebuild because we were adding a dog run anyway. I'm so glad we started over this time with American Fence.  Every part of this experience was great.  Milton was easy to work with and very knowledgable.  His wife Eunice or assistant Michelle answer the phones and are so sweet and helpful.  Customer service is so important to them.

Home Services,5.0,CG,I am so incredibly thankful that I chose the company. I will definitely be using them again and will be using them again in the future. The staff is great. They were courteous and professional. It was a pleasure working with them. I had to call two times for a leaky toilet in my attic and it was fixed within a week. I received a call from a maintenance person who had to be able to go to the office because it was late in the night and it was leaking into my garage. The maintenance person called me back and said that the problem was a leak from the drain. I had called multiple times for a leaky toilet that was fixed within a week. I have never had a leaky toilet in my attic and my attic is still leaking and I was able to find a home that was not flooded with water. They said that the toilet was on the floor and that the problem was from the drain. I was told that the toilet was not leaking and that there was no other leak.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I've been using Sweeping Beauty for about a year and have had continual issues.  My preferred method of contact is email and responses were not always timely.  Beside that fact, the cleaning is not consistent nor is it good.  At best they seem to dry dust the furniture, they used my cleaning products when they supposedly have their own.  Always knock the bathroom mirror off the tracks of the medicine cabinet and cannot seem to vaccum the cobwebs that always collect on either side of the fireplace.  They do not clean the inside of the microwave or empty trash cans.  I was told from the beginning I could not have more than 7 items out on my dresser in order for them to clean.  So, I always spent the night prior and the morning of my scheduled cleaning doing alot of prep work for a mediocre job at best.  I am paying for a service so I don't have to come home and clean but I seemed to end up paying for them to do a less than thorough job and end up cleaning myself.  The price is less than other services but I guess you get what you pay for."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. These people come in, sweet talk you, and tell you they will treat you like family.

I had my roof, patio, front door and front window redone with Power Home. 

Roof - they installed the WRONG COLOR. When I called to complain amd rectify, the blame was passed around and the crew manager acted like he was doing ME a favor by giving me a discount. Probably occured because there was no crew manager on site AND the entire crew spoke ZERO English. Power Homes CLAIMS to hire army veterans ... but I am unsure of their statements validity, in my opinion. 

Door - they miscalculated and installed a short piece on my door, leaving a hole for bugs to nest. Had to call to fix. They showed up without notice Saturday, when we were scheduled for Monday. 

Patio - looks great but is completely crooked. Waiting on someone to fix it. 

Honestly the one star is ONLY for the 50-year roof warranty. That is good.

These people are swindlers and no better than the unlicensed repairmen that come to your door. Sure, they will fix their mistakes, but they will also make you have to be a helicopter parent to make sure they are doing their jobs."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"They were incompetent, basically.     We had issues with outside AC fans that were in horrible shape.   These guys came out and stuck some wood chips around as shims in the side of the fan housing and charged $75.00 for this.    Needless to say, this fix did not work.
Also, they were unable to do a simple maintenance call because they said they were missing the filters they needed (which we already had ourselves) and refused to go into the attic to see why we had no air flow into the upstairs bedrooms.   It turns out we needed a lot of work on the HVAC system to get the airflow right - we hired someone else to do this.  We also hired someone else to fix the outside fans (and you can be sure they did not put shims into the housing!).
We have never experienced such complete incompetence and lack of concern for quality work .   This company hires people who could care less about their customers.
We will NEVER hire Jet Plumbing, Heating and Drain Svc again.   We would much rather pay someone else to do the work who cares about getting the job done right."

The consummate professional, Misti, as a matter of routine, provided us with a service level far beyond our expectations.  First, she is a responsive listener, and worked tirelessly to show us homes meeting our very specific requests.  As out-of-towners looking to relocate, we had myriad questions about the area, the state of the market, local real estate codes, taxes, etc., etc.  Misti's extensive knowledge and experience served us well.  Questions she couldn't answer immediately were always answered within a day.  And, Misti has an enormous network of resources which she leverages to her clients' benefit.  A bonus, Misti's upbeat attitude kept us on track.  She's the ultimate diplomat.  Our time in the area was limited; so we were forced to leave before finding our new home.  We trusted Misti who, following our departure, continued to search for property for us, taking pictures and ferreting out the information we needed to make a decision long distance.  We successfully closed on a property due only to Misti's efforts.  As you can imagine, Misti is a very busy realtor; so we were lucky to snag her."

But they have made no effort to fix these things. And no communication on when they will be fixed. We have 2 dogs having to be locked up for a 4th day in a bedroom thinking maintenance will actually show up and fix these issues. At this point my family is considering a hotel for a night to escape this overly priced crap. 
Also, since moving here the pool has been closed several times without a warning or a sign on the gate. The gate will stop working, which includes the BBQ area.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Man, moving sucks balls, don't it? We were moving home to Brooklyn and paraded six - ten different movers through the house. We got a bunch of estimates and ended up going with Cord North American. For two reasons 

A) Bernie (our agent) was the only one to follow-up after the initial estimate and 

B) they offer insurance up to $30,000 and no extra charge. So, other estimates were lower, but insurance pushed it over the top.

Cord is just a local middle-man that arranges the moves. Corporate handles the billing and drivers come from wherever. Other than one teensy, tiny ""we're changing everything on you at the last minute"" (which was reversed after eight nerve-racking hours) everything went smoothly. The people were friendly and paperwork came went it was supposed to. 

Dealing with the corporate office in Indiana has been another matter entirely. I already wrote a review for them, seen here http://moourl.com/t4mvv, so I don't bring it up to pour salt in their rude, lying eyes. But, only as a warning that if Cord owes you money, it will have to come from Corporate and they don't like parting with money that belongs to you. 

But, Cord are good people. Can't blame the kids for the sins of the parent, right?"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"This is one of the best hotels that I have stayed at! Instead of your normal hotel, BentoLiving's concept is apartment style hotel which features all the comforts of home. Many of the amenities that you enjoy at home can be found at Bento including washer + dryer, full kitchen including stove, oven, dishwasher, full fridge and freezer. Utensils, cookware like pots and pans and cutlery included. The ""living"" part really blends your home lifestyle to your vacation life whether its making a home cooked meal, curling on the couch or just doing your laundry. 

A first for me is a pull out bed from above the wall behind the yellow couch. Amazing, functional and space saving, what a great concept! The best part was how COMFORTABLE the pillow and the bed was. This location is right next to the train tracks and yes the train does run at night. They include ear plugs for you. Everything is clean and brand new looking. Very well maintained.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"My experience was with replacing house window glass only, no autos, etc.
Vista was the only company I called that offered a free estimate - the others required a service charge.  The estimator arrived on-time and quickly measured the windows and got us a quote on the spot.  It was close to the same price as the other forms, but they were able to do the tinting as well.
They needed about a week to have the glass delivered and contacted us to do the install when it came in.  They were here in a day or two.
It was a cold day and the caulk was stiff and the installer broke one of our existing windows - they replaced it for free (which I'd expect).
When he was doing the install we noticed several additional windows that were leaking, so the installer got us an immediate quote with a great price so we ordered the additional glass.
So far we are very happy with Vista - they have been very good people to deal with.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was the window they broke - accidents happen, but accountability....
I will update the review if there is anything of note in the 2nd set of window installs."

The closet in the 1-bedroom is a major issue! I appreciate the up-grade, but the layout is awkward and you can't even get to a section of the closet due to a wall! Did someone not think about this before construction? Also, the closet upgrade doesn't even match the rest of the apartment! The floors creak with every single step you take. The walls are literally paper thin! I got the privilege of listening to my neighbor snore every single night!

Home Services,5.0,OR,"My husband and I visited the RV show out in Pomona today and as we were walking past, I saw this aluminum trailer that caught the corner of my eye. Even from afar I was drawn to it and as I walked up and took a little tour I was BLOWN AWAY. Matt and Joanna were both there and were very friendly, explaining how their company came to be but wow- this is so far from a trailer. It's totally makes you rethink ""trailer""- this is comparable to the tiny house race that's been so popular lately but the home is so thoroughly thought through and it's amazing- so sleek and modern, clean and green- solar panels, lithium batteries- self powered and exquisitely beautiful. 
With housing costs so high in California, this is something my husband and I talked about all the way home and after seeing this it makes it easy to think out of the typical housing box- this is absolutely beautiful. Still in a daze after seeing this and I wish I had more time to go thru all the details of this beautiful smart home. You really have to appreciate the thought that went into building and designing this. Matt, Joanna I think you'll be seeing me again real soon ;)"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"Horrible, they are not very easy to work with.  They are real quick to charge you for ""not having renters insurance"" but when you provide proof not once but twice they still charge you, and haven't refunded the money like they said they would.  Gave us a hard time because of ""how much it would cost"" to dispatch a plumber to the house when a pipe burst in March in Tennessee.  It was 75 degrees outside, surely didn't freeze, poor craftsmanship is more like it.  The bottom floor flooded about 1/2 inch throughout their hardwood floor.  We called them as soon as it was discovered.  They had no sense of urgency, and ask if it could wait due to the cost of a plumber coming out on a Sunday.  Well I guess they were worried about a plumbers charge not having to replace an entire downstairs floor .  Their maintenance man comes out to check the air conditioner that has already gone out before.  Bottom of the house works just fine, top is not able to keep up. He states its the filters.  Charge you $60 dollars after taking the filters and not replacing them and saying he added more Freon.  Would not recommend."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"I am selling my house and buyer had the line scoped and said there is a blockage in line, I called horizon to clean the line, the tech name thomas came and request to see paper from township and request to see paper from the buyer inspection,  I told him that he  need any paper to clean sewer line,   he said he has to camera the line to make sure he cleaned the line.  I  told him we only need to clean the line,  didn't order camera and didn't ask him to do lateral inspection.   then He started to screaming and said we are doing it illegal  and he is calling the police.  i am not sure whether he on drugs or he was pressured by the company to try to find bigger problem and make the sale.  I have to asked him to leave my house!  I then called Horizon 3 times and asked to speak with a manger,  now 24 hours passed, No one called back since.  I can only assume they are guilty.  They didnt waste any time charge my credit card for the service without even give me an invoice.  This is so wrong!"
Home Services,1.5,OR,"The reviews here are abysmal, and it sucks that most people have such a negative view of Valet Trash. I've had mostly positive experiences with Valet Trash. They typically always take my trash; one day they refused to take several boxes after I just moved into my complex. I didn't think it was a big deal though. It reeked of laziness by the workers, but nothing to overly complain about. 

The reason I give it 4 stars though, is for customer service. I lost a UPS box in front of my home and I thought VT threw it away accidentally. I did not expect to reach anyone on the phone when I called. I figured a trash company would just give me the run around. While on hold and accepting that my box was gone, VT answered and was EXTREMELY helpful in trying to locate my box. After the matter was resolved, they made not one but TWO follow-up calls to ensure the situation was taken care of. To me, that was immensely impressive. I don't know who picks up my trash 5 nights a week, but I do know who works at the Tampa corporate office, and I now have faith that if there ever is an issue, they will be able to help."
Home Services,1.0,OR,Worst mortgage company ever.  Borderline to be a fraudulent company.  Specifically for refinance.  I had my loan with them and wanted to refinance when the rates dropped.  They offered me a good rate to refinance and asked me to stay with them.  They locked the rate for 4 months!  Then they made sure that the paper work does not finish in time in order for me to pay the high interest rate on my loan.  They were hoping that by creating headaches I drop my refinance and stay at their high rate or the rates may go up in 4 months. I followed with them weekly but out of 6 messages I would get one answer with false information.  They would ask me for the same paper work that I provided them months ago to delay the process.  After 4 months I went with the Better Mortgage Services and was able to refinance in 3 weeks with much better rate and closing cost. I almost did not pay any closing costs with the Better Mortgage Services as they gave me $6000 credit.  I definitely recommend not to use PHH mortgage and if you have a mortgage with them try the Better Mortgage Services to refinance.

The damage to the sidewalk where the curb vent is located is  PLAINLY VISIBLE FROM THE SURFACE (see linked photos). No competent inspector should have missed this. There is no mention of this whatsoever in my report (I would post that here as well but these guys ""copyrighted"" it so I can't).

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I intensely loathe this highway and thank the road-gods every day that it's not part of my daily commute. I would lose my brain if I had to drive on this tiny, two-laned, backed-up, crap road that is filled with terrible drivers. Yes, I drive up Broad Street each weekday. Yes, Broad Street has an obnoxious amount of (red) lights. Yes, Broad Street is a thousand times better than 76.

World, please, let me turn you on to this great concept that is unknown still to the vast majority of PA drivers. ""Blinkers."" You see, if you want to change lanes, you put a blinker on, pause, ensure that a car is not adjacent to your car in said requested lane, and then move over. You do not just casually slide over, like you own the asphalt. You don't.

This non-use-of-blinkers issue is especially tough on the Schuylkill, when people are trying to figure out, ""Oh, do I need to be on 676? Oh, I suppose I need to be in the left lane, then."" Slide.

Just. Sigh. Avoid this highway. It's not an Expressway. The road name lies. And the road itself is a dangerous mess of crazy-cars and crazy-drivers and no-blinkers.

Which explains why there are accidents reported on it every time I turn on the traffic report."

Home Services,2.5,OR,I'm disappointed in this apartment complex. I had to move back to CA for a family emergency. I was not able to give them more then 3 weeks notice. They want 60 days. The thing that upset me was they wanted me to pay for 2 months and they wanted to rent it out during those 2 months. So getting my money and the other renters money to get double the pay. They first broke their broke their contract with me. I put multiple complains in on aggressive dogs. My dog was attacked 2 times and bit and a friend was bit and knocked over along with me cutting my hand trying to stop a dog from attacking my dog again. Every time I told them they said they can't control who has dogs or what dogs belong to who. What? Really so you don't check? You had me give a pic of my dog and had to meet her. They have breed restrictions but multiple Pitties are there. Do not move there and expect your dog or our self to be safe from other animals. They only want money and don't care about safety. Now I'm stuck paying for my last 2 months and a termination fee. Thanks for holding up your end of your contract.
Home Services,5.0,OR,"First off i need to say that I really appreciated the clear communication and schedule flexibility from this company. we had a minor setback in our schedule and they were able to patiently accommodate my last minute request.

price was very reasonable and i even tipped them for their service quality and efficiency 

their work was thorough but efficient. they got a lot done in a short matter of time. 5BR, 3BR, kitchen, family room and dining area.  

Markese was my point of contact and also one of the guys to come clean. 

They used clean cleaning supplies, good products, and left the place smelling and looking great. 

I'd say the only thing that would have taken their service to 5 stars would be a checklist of some sort or something that they can say ""here's what we did""  (when they came , they walked the place and asked us what we wanted cleaned) it was a big awkward for me because the whole reason i called them was to avoid thinking about cleaning the place ha, but i understand why they asked. perhaps a list to show the client before , and the client can check off what they want cleaned (along with any optional services that require additional costs). 

overall, happy with their service"

He gave us helpful advice when necessary, he was very accessible and answered any questions in a timely manner, he helped us through our first-time-buyer-anxiety and panic, and efficiently dealt with all the last minute surprises and situations that arose while we were trying to close.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"What exceptional quality in GHI services! We've moved 14 times and experienced the full range of stress that can come with home-buying. But Mark Timpani streamlines the  process and delivers what few others can -- the confidence of knowing that your potential new home has been evaluated top to bottom by a certified master inspector (he's one of only a handful in southern AZ to hold this title). We were grateful for his comprehensive analysis of house systems and particularly pleased that Mark offers thermal-imaging. It's hard to beat utilizing a technology that allows the inspector (and prospective homeowner) the ability to see through walls, for water leaks, short circuits, insulation gaps, and more. Mark arrived on time, performed a thorough GHI over several hours, did a walk-through with us after the fact, and created a detailed report for us by end of day (on New Year's Eve, no less). Mark answered texts directly, and he and Gina, also of Pride Property Inspections, responded to every e-mail within the hour...often minutes. Mark also provided helpful input for us weeks after the fact, when we had questions regarding a potential repair. We can't thank Mark enough for how incredibly responsive, reliable, and helpful he was from start to finish -- hands-down, he's one of the best in the business!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I called Joseph Giannone with my AC not working and 90degree heat.  I was admittedly desperate to get it fixed, and another HVAC group was not available - so i trusted the good reviews here and called them.

I knew it was the freon and told them so.  Still, it took them over an hour to take a look, diagnose, and give me my options.  Now granted they fixed the problem and got the AC up and running again.  But not without a charging me way more than reasonable!  They kept on blaming the high cost of freon, but after looking it up, they charged me double what they should have.

Further, they gave me quotes on a new unit.  Since their quote, I have gotten 2 more, and thank goodness I did!  Their quote was at least $2000 more than any others (for the cheapest unit).  further, the other companies indicated there would be a size problem installing the higher SEER units, while this company would have been more than willing to take my money for something that wouldn't fit.

While I am sure they are competent technicians, their prices are ridiculous.  If i had known better and could stand the heat, I would've told them to leave and called someone else."

They were dishonest and they took advantage of the fact that I moved out of town. I called to discuss it but with no success and just more and more lies.

On the other hand with such amount of rent you will pay you can get far better places to live. They complex is dirty, laundry facilities are out dated dirty and the complex is not gated so be prepared to see a lot of homeless people walking around in the complex.

I usually don't put negatives reviews on businesses but my moving out experience was horrible and despite being a very good renter I felt I was not treated very well and they were cheaters. I will complain to the BBB and their corporate office to solve the issue and will update my review."

I truly cannot heap enough well-deserved praise on Cherry Hill Painting. My husband and I were moving to Mount Laurel after four years in Toronto. We had purchased our house but knew it needed ""updating. ""  We had a narrow window of ten days between closing and move-in dates. Since the furniture would impede painting, I really wanted to get certain rooms done before we arrived; but that required coordinating everything remotely, including color selection. From the moment I contacted Doug, I progressed from overwhelmed to hopeful to relieved to overjoyed to grateful. Within a week (prior to our move in date -- woo-hoo!), Doug & Team had completed everything on my wishlist: wallpaper stripped, three rooms + two bathrooms painted. Not being in town, I had no fewer than a dozen sticky obstacles, and Doug & Team conquered one after the other. At any point, they could have complicated my already-complicated undertaking; instead they completely unburdened me, making my life easier at an especially critical time. Cherry Hill Painting does exceptional work -- everything looks absolutely gorgeous. On top of that, the ""ease of doing business"" with Cherry Hill Painting ratchets them into a category reserved for the best of the best. Next up. I'm hiring Doug & Team to paint my foyer."

I highly recommend him.I moved from a 2 bedroom with a 2 bedroom with a 2 bath and a 1 bedroom with a bath. I was very disappointed with the quality of the flooring and the lack of color in the walls.  I had to go back and forth with the leasing office to find out what was wrong.  They are always very helpful and friendly. 

They did not do a good job on the ceiling and ceiling fans and the front door. I had to replace the front door and the back door. 

They did not clean the flooring with either of the paint in the front and back doors. 

They did not even mention the old roof on the other side of the building. 

The other issues I had were the flooring.  The window would not open when"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Where do I start?  Sent them a contract and check at the end of June.  They cashed 50% deposit check the first week of July and never called me to schedule install.  Hounded them and then they set a date of 7/31.  Show up and rip out my AC condenser and realize they did not submit for a permit.  After several weeks, they come back for 2 days to do install and still don't complete.Say they need a gas line inspection.  Schedule for 9/17.  I drive 2.5 hrs to meet them with a time window of 8am-2pm.  No inspection completed that day and the installers leave.  This is 4 complete days so far of my time.  Have asked to speak to the CEO to give him constructive advice about their business processes.  NO CALL.  Still do not have the job finished.  The only reason I bought from them in the first place is that the sale rep was a friend.  They were actually $2000 higher than my other quote from a local contractor.  At the time I justified the difference that if anything goes wrong, I will be treated right.  HA! You be the judge.  Would you recommend a company like this to anyone??"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I have to take a moment and recognize Joey DiPaola and his exceptional service. My husband and I had been shopping for hardwood flooring for months when we finally found a wood we liked. We decided to pulled the trigger at this store. After learning that the wrong wood was ordered and the correct wood on permanent back order, Joey did everything to get us comparable (better) wood and keep the project within our budget, which included reaching out to multiple regional managers. After signing the contract, we had a family emergency come up and we had to cancel the project. Joey was very understanding and told us that if we were still interested in the wood, he would continue to check in with us periodically to see when the time was right. Three months later, we circled back around with Joey to say we were ready to move forward, but we were worried about losing all the concessions that LL had made on our project. Joey worked diligently to make sure we got the same deal as before, along with an even better financing deal, and our wood arrived this week. We are so excited for the install and have nothing but positive things to say about Joey and the team at LL. Thank you for taking care of us!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I love Courtney's  I had a unit installed with them about a year ago, a HVAC system. I noticed, shortly after having it installed that there was a slight rattling coming from the unit. I called and they promptly sent someone out to diagnosis the issue. a tech came and did a couple of adjustments and it seemed to do the trick. except a few months later when the heat was on all the time. the rattling came back. I called Courtney's. in walks tech #2. he made some adjustments and it seemed to work. only for a little while. I recently made a 3rd call to Courtney's and said that with the summer months coming I needed to get this rattling, hopefully resolved. they sent Mark A. He walks in and began asking questions about the unit, what had been done and then with a bit of diagnosis. no more rattling! We started and stopped the fan, turned the air blower on and off to make sure no more rattling. so far. so good! 

I have to say Courtney's does a great job with customer service, friendliness of their team and their techs! I truly appreciate their willingness to get to the root of the problem. Thank you Mark A. you seemed to have solved the issue."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"Yeureka installed a beautiful roof on my home.  Problem is,  it was not installed correctly over my den and began to leak.  After multiple attempts,  I was able to contact a ""manager"" at the company to send a worker out.  Worker came out and attempted to tell me that I must have a hole in my siding.   The roof is fine .  I insisted that the projector manager get on the phone.   After a very heated conversation,  he sent the worker back on the roof to remove some tiles to show me it was fine. I watched out of the bedroom window as he pulled up the tiles,  the wood was saturated underneath.   Everything had to be ripped up and reinstalled. The roof WAS installed incorrectly.  After multiple phone calls and text messages,  a project manager was supposed to get in touch with me yesterday to repair my den ceiling-that they said they would repair because the leak was their fault.   I have still not heard from them.  There is now mold in the ceiling.  I have attempted to contact them several times through phone, email ""contact us"" and a cell phone number that I happened to get and still nothing."

Home Services,1.0,OR,"Lived here for a year and wish that we had never even considered this place. We put in work orders to have things fixed and they didn't do anything until we literally grabbed a maintenance worker as they were driving by. To say the office workers are helpful would be a boldface lie. They never answer the phone, I had to call 9 times in one day to get ahold of anyone after having called other days. Dominique in the office (assistant) has a horrible attitude and is extremely disrespectful, it's laughable that she is assistant anything, much less at a rental property.  We signed paperwork saying we were leaving and were going to be paying a prorated amount, but they never adjusted it in the system. We were supposed to know to either send the check to their corporate for the correct amount or pay what we were billed for and then wait until we move out to receive our money back. She said ""If you woulda called I could have told you, but you didn't."" Ridiculous. I asked to speak to the property manager and she said ""She's been right here so she knows."" Not the point. Dominique and the entire staff are incompetent. The maintenance crew are fantastic and helpful though. My one star only goes to them."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Three days before Hurricane Irma rolled over us, one of our two garage door springs snapped... an annoyance at any other time, but having a non-operating garage door during a weather emergency was going to be a potentially huge problem.

I called Banko immediately (I'd used them before) and the person I spoke with was extremely nice and understanding. They said they could have someone here between 8:00 and noon the next day...and that they would call before they arrived.

Around 7:35 a.m., our phone rang... it was the repairman saying he was already in our driveway. He came inside, and had both springs replaced and lubricated (along with all of the other moving parts on the door and track) by 8:00 a.m.

I asked him whether the fact that I'd been lubricating the springs with silicon spray since the last time they were replaced had done any good and he informed me that the lubrication *only* helps with binding--it doesn't extend their life at all. But I'd been using the 'wrong' lubricant. He suggested a ""propane"" lubricant and gave me a full can that'll probably last me for years.

All in all, great job--and our 19-year-old garage door operates quieter than it has in probably 18 years!  ;-)

Even better.. Three days later, Hurricane Irma didn't destroy the door I just paid to have fixed!"

I called John and he told me it would cost $250 to replace it.  I paid $200 for it and he told me it would cost $200 to replace it.  I asked him what the difference was between the $250 and $200.  He said it was $100.  That was fine, but he said it was $200 for the gas furnace.  That was a huge difference.  I said fine.  I asked him what he was going to do and he said that was the issue.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"Had a shipment paid for and booked with freightcenter. Since I was waiting for their YRC driver to show up, I went online and did a search for freight classes and NMFC Codes since I am new to this. I ended up on a site shiptms. I found the freight class I thought I should use and called them to be sure. I got the answer right away and they offered to get a shipping quote to compare to what I booked with freightcenter for the next time I ship. My cost with freightcenter was $562. Dave at shiptms was $402. If I had not booked with freightcenter I would have cancelled but I have now switched to shiptms and they get all my business now. The reason for this review is that after my shipment arrived, I got another charge on my card by freightcenter for $350 stating the shipment was inspected and was a different freight class. To date I have not had any extra charges or inspection charges using shiptms. Reading all these negative reviews goes to show freightcenter is in it for profit only. There are better solutions out there and I learned never click on the one advertising everywhere. They are probably doing this to many others to cover their advertising costs. It's like a ponzi scheme but for freight."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"This was our third time using Sultans of Schlep in 2.5 years.  The first time we drove across the country and needed someone to unload a Pod for us at our new apartment.  While every other company said it was either too small of a job or that they were already booked a week out, Tom (the manager) arranged for two movers to meet us with no problems and for the cheapest price by far.  The second time we used their packers and movers.  The packer packed our large collection of kitchen dishes and items in 2 hours flat and nothing broke in the  move.  This second time we moved to another apartment across the city, and the Sultans of Schlep arranged for a truck to come to our place, loaded one bedroom worth of stuff into it in 1.5 hours (amazing) and drove to the new place, rearranged it to our liking, and were completely done in 3.5 hours flat.  We just moved to the suburbs, and we used this company again for moving and packing.  Their speed is outstanding, and they are always professional and kind.  Tom works around our schedule, and has never had a problem with us needing to change the time/date at the very last minute.  Great movers."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"We were previously customers of ServiceMark and had a service plan that includes yearly heating and AC unit tune ups (we have separate systems). I called and made an appointment back in September and that's when I found out that ServiceMark was acquired by Horizon, but they said that they would still honor all the service agreements so no issues there. They didn't have an appointment until early November, so the technician came out last week and upon looking at our furnace and sending pictures to his manager told me that neither he nor anyone else at Horizon was able to service it anymore because they were all unfamiliar with it. I don't know anything about HVAC, but honestly I'm pretty surprised that a large company like Horizon doesn't employ a single technician that is familiar with our furnace. Additionally, this must mean that all of the ServiceMark technicians were let go, because they were all able to service it. The Horizon technician was very professional and apologetic, and I am giving 2 (2.5 if I could!) because they are going to refund us the money for the service plan. But now I will have to pay every year for a tune up, and it's much more expensive than even what Horizon typically charges without a plan. I'm very disappointed that this happened."

They've been nothing but crooked af. Lying about fees. About repairs. Good luck dealing with their cracked out repairman. That's why everything is fucked. I made upgrades to the apartment and left them hoping for a more positive deposit return. They sent me a bill. -_- then when I said I'd involve the law, they weren't interested in pursuing the amount they said I owed if I dropped it all now. I was fine to let it go until they tried to stick me with this electric bill. They know exactly who this is. They are trying to take advantage of someone with a disability. See you in court. My anxiety is pretty crippling unless I'm pissed off. I'm also having correspondence with the electric company to prove it isn't my bill. They don't know that my dad loves to litigate. I'm related to a judge. Come. At. Me. Bruh.

Again he arrived on time - noted the system did not need fluid just a clean filter which I had.   Since there was nothing needed to fixed on the unit - he did not even charge us.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"First of all if you do move here demand that they do a physical walk through with you before you move in. They make you do it yourself and there are things you could miss. 
Second of all even if you ask they take forever to fix minor problems if they even get around to it. 
Third when you go to move out insist on them doing a walk through with you. They pretty much refused to do it with me. I payed to have the place professionally cleaned and they still kept my entire deposit. I gave them more than a month to let me know that it wasn't up to their standards but they never bothered to contact me. At least a note or phone call to let me know so that I could have dealt with the issues.  Something about unknown cleaning, repairs and carpet cleaning in the final statement.  I left it cleaner than when I moved in. If I would have known they were going to keep my deposit I would have not paid to have it professionally cleaned.
To make matters worse they must have left the heat on a very high setting because the electric bill I received for the month I was not there was twice as much as any month I was there.

Home Services,1.0,OR,"We were patrons of CenturyLink for several years (internet only), until January 9th of this year when our contract came up for renewal, and we decided to cancel. We initially left CableOne due to the price difference; CenturyLink had a promotion that was less than half the cost of CableOne, for comparable speeds.

To make a long story short, over the next 3 years, CenturyLink increased in price, and from all observable evidence, decreased in speed. We were no loner able to watch Netflix and upload files simultaneously, and any online gaming was nearly impossible. This was not the case when we first began using them.

Their customer service was unable to help us to any reasonable extent with regard to a better speed/price ratio, and were horrendously difficult to even make contact with. There were several times where we literally had hour long wait periods to even chat with a representative.

We've decided to move back to CableOne for the simple fact that, although they aren't the cheapest around, and their customer service has hardly been any better, they don't hold you to a minimum year long contract. I'd rather give my money to an awful month-to-month company, than be tied to an awful year long contract company with severe penalties for leaving early.

When I went to the office to show proof I paid all I got was oops, we applied your payment to another apt.  That's a pretty big oops for not caring about posting undeserved notices.  During the move out process, we were present and signed the form with no noted damage other than normal wear and tear.  We received our final move out cost to find a charge for a crisper drawer.  Questioned the charge (was not listed on our move out sheet) and produced a picture of no damage (we took pics of everything).  We were told we would be contacted.  It's been 2 week and 2 phone calls and still have no answer on the refund.  They don't care to ensure safety in their complex either.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Plumbers get a bad rap, man.  They are stereotypically known as being unreliable, costly, and having their butt cracks hanging out in the middle of your kitchen.  Luckily for me, Mark at JB Plumbing was none of these things.  

While getting our house painted, the line that brings water to the icemaker in the freezer broke.  The painters did their best to fix it, but even I could see that the line was just plain old and needed to be fixed by an actual plumber.

Well, to my surprise and delight, Mark and his assistant came not at 7 am but at 655 am!  He was in and out quickly, I had water back in my house, and I found a new go-to plumber.  I'm not going to lie- getting that itty bitty water line fixed wasn't cheap, but I think the price was fair and is what I would have paid anyone else for the job.

Like other Yelpers have said, you never want to need a plumber, but I'm glad I have someone reliable to use in the future."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"This place is the worst at first everything looks good but after you move in everything change, neighbors are the worst to say the least you could not do anything in your apartment  even when yo pay you rent every month they will call you the police for anything at ridiculous hours  like 9:00 pm and when you get robbed no one calls the police  unbelievable. The management office is there for nothing and they are not able to help you never even when I request a transfer from the apartment that I was robbed they wanted me to pay a transfer fee and a new rent for the same apartment but in a different location, at the end that same apartment burned to the grounds a week before my contract was over, I'm so glad I left that place cause even the fees that they charge you for sending you the rent bill is ridiculous, like the pest control fee which I never saw anyone doing anything, parking sucks too there are visitors which you Friends are not able to use because people that live in the complex park there instead of using the normal ones and on top of that there's always a Turk doing rounds to see which car can take. In conclusion do not move in it's not worthy."

Home Services,2.0,OR,"Martino Picariello is OUTSTANDING. I'd been apartment hunting for several weeks and hadn't found the right place. I had reached out to several realtors at different companies to schedule showings and asked them to let me know when they had new listings, but most of them added me to automated mailing lists or just never got back to me.
When Martino took the time to actually respond to my inquiry on the Maxwell Realty website and asked what I was looking for, I gave him a list of must-haves for my apartment search (I'm a high maintenance New Yorker) and assumed I'd get the same generic response or never hear from him again. He listened carefully to my requests, didn't waste my time trying to convince me to see something I didn't want, and came back with several listings that were all great options--I ended up signing a lease for the first apartment he showed me!
He was very generous with his time and listened to all of my questions. I never felt rushed or like he was trying to sell me something. I really believe he takes pride in solving problems for his clients and that he genuinely enjoys finding the best options for them.
Whenever I move again (not soon--love my new apartment!), I will absolutely seek Martino out again. He is truly a joy to work with!"

My nephew went to deliver some food to my sister.  He parked at what was last week visitor parking and unbeknownst to him they changed that specific Row to residential only parking. And no longer visitor parking, in less than 20 minutes they had already booted his car. Majority of people who live in that complex are already in a low-budget low-income base there's barely 15 parking spots for visitors in that area that they constantly Zone to boot their cars and make money off of the people who do come to visit these people. I cannot even believe that they could not even give a warning since they had just rezone that visitor parking it wasn't like we were trying to get one over on this company or the residency.

I've never done business with a mortgage company that doesn't have a 5 day grace period, if your payment isn't there by 8am on the first of each month, they start harassing you with automated calls and threats.

We just received a notice that there isn't enough money in escrow, for insurance, taxes, etc.  They let it get over $2,000.00, yes two thousand dollars short.  Having a mortgage with this place is like having one of those balloon mortgages that were popular back in the 90's.  Every year your mortgage payment goes up!!!

Luckily, we are selling that house and won't have to deal with that mess.  Unfortunately, looks like this mortgage is the one we are stuck with for the new house.

It was assured that I would not under any circumstances pay more than the quoted price of $1994.52. They chose Western Van Lines to complete the Move. When the movers arrived, double the quoted price was demanded. Because I had to be out of my apartment the next morning, I allowed them to take my things. I was also given a delivery window of 10-15 days after pick up. That was 4 weeks ago on July 28th. It is now August 27th and I have been unable to find neither the location of my items nor my estimated delivery date. The customer service line has been unwilling to give that information. They have been extremely difficult to get ahold of. I have called approximately 3 times a week and have now heard the phrase ""hopefully by the end of the week"" for 2 straight weeks. This company should not be allowed to do this to anyone else.

This girl smoked weed in the apartment daily, also did harder drugs and brought random guys in all the time. The other 3 girls complained to management constantly but they refused to do anything about it. We were told she was getting fined but I'm fairly certain she ended up without any fines being paid. The other roommates begged management to relocate her but they said there was nothing they could do.  They called security several times on her.  Sometimes they showed up. Sometimes they didn't. We paid extra for my daughter to have a parking space in the building rather than have to walk from the parking lot across the street. The garage security door was broken for days at a time. Once there was a homeless man in there who tried to follow my daughter onto the elevator. Security was no where to be found. Also, when they moved in the apartment was filthy. We took pictures and reported it and they sent someone to clean the floors but it still took my daughter multiple washings to get them clean. I could go on,  but I'll stop here. The HUB sucks."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"I've had the business bookmarked for two years...ever since Anita had her spray insulation done. I walked into her house and couldn't believe what a difference it made. I thought to myself, I need to get this closed cell foam blown under my 130 year old house...and it was added to the lengthy list of home improvement projects.

Fast forward to this month. I called and spoke to Brad and we chatted about what I wanted done. He stopped by my house for measurements the next day (when I wasn't home so no time off of work). He quoted a price later that day.

The price was lower than I expected so Yay! And we set up a day for them to come blow foam. He was a good communicator throughout the whole process via email, phone and text. He answered all my questions and was really good to work with.

They arrived right on time yesterday morning (at 7:30) and were finished by 3 pm. They did say my house was pretty easy. I had long since cleared most of the junk out from under the house, although they found a crate and a garbage can (thanks old tenants). And my house has over 3 feet of clearance so no belly crawling needed.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"I was hesitant to have window tinting performed here after reading various reviews scattered about the internet and seeing the shop location, but it turned out to be an excellent tint job. I had the tint applied in January, and 6 months later it still looks great. The tint has a lifetime replacement warranty, and I can't say whether the owner will uphold that or not but I don't think I'll need it because the tint is good quality and not made of dyes that fade and turn purple. The cost of the tinting on my car was just under $100, which is a fair price. Tinting can often be performed for less than this, but not much less. I took the car in, the work was started immediately and a few hours later it was ready to drive away. I'm very happy with the quality of the work. There are no bubbles, cracks, distortions, or wrinkles. I would have given a 5 star if the price was lower, in the range that I'm used to paying. I know some people pay hundreds of dollars for tinting their SUV or sport car, but I usually don't pay more than $75 for a modest car. Again, the work was great, I just think the price should be a bit lower given my previous experience having tint jobs done to my vehicles."

But anyway, after fiddling around he said I have a leak and he doesn't know where the leak was and he recommended a new unit rather than paying thousands to find the leak. The cost for a new AC and furnace he said would be between 12k-15k. I was horrified, I just moved in and why didn't inspection catch this. Anyway, I decided to get a second opinion. So the after paying this dude $79 for just showing up, the other guy says the same thing, I have a leak, but there are two bolts loose on the AC and that's where the leak is. So he tightened them and added refrigerant and charged me $400. That's a big difference in price. Not sure why Right Now didn't catch the two bolts loose but I'm glad the other guy did.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"I had a coupon with tune up for $39 value (1 lbs freon free included if freon was low). When he comes up, freon was low and there was chance of leak. So he made it service call as it was low in freon and AC was not working well according to him, and further the leak detection was chargeable to $198 + freon (chargeable for all)+ fixing it (unknown price). 
 Now coupn says ""if low on freon"" in AC tune up and technician says ""service call"" if low in freon and then makes it a leak detection. So 3 star. As it seems complicated to me.

Tune up means clean up drain lines, check for any leak and that all parts of AC are working fine. But only got freon checked in service call/ tune up but paid for all as coupn was waste.
We just got freon added and AC is running well. 

I m not prepared to pay for leak detection and fixing as AC was checked 6 months back by AAA airwaves and 2 lbs freon was added too (Sept.) when they came to see AC stopped (coz of ice).

I really enjoy spending my lunch hour going to the leasing office to get an update on my service requests to get the same lies from different people.  My favorite lie is ""we will get to your service request as soon as we can.  But, we have 3 maintenance people preparing apartments for new tenants.  Really!  So, you are saying that we don't care that you are a current tenant and that you are paying our salary.  I would like to see how the leasing staff would handle that in WaWa.  Oh, sorry, we have your order, we took your money, but we have new customers here so don't expect your order anytime too soon.  Gotta go.  Spending another lovely lunch hour at the leasing office."
Home Services,1.0,OR,"This company gets all of their money by lying to their customers and scamming them. Received a promotion for $27.99 security system and the original rep from ADT was making the process sound super easy. The rep arrived at my house and then tried up selling me all this equipment and said that he didn't make any money off up selling ( which I find hard to believe ). He then convinced us that the $52.99 would be the best option for us because we have smart phones, so we trusted him and went with that plan. He went over billing, what date the charge would come out, and that all turned out to be wrong. They charged the wrong account and not the amount they said they would. Also I thought I was working with and ADT rep this whole time and it turned out to be Defenders. Doesn't seem like Defenders has their customers best interest and for such a reputable company I thought ADT was, I am surprised they are contracted with a company like Defenders. Also when I called Defenders to cancel my service, the sales manager laughed at me and basically said I lied about my whole experience. 

Folks please don't fall for ADT/Defenders scam and if you see a promotion, look the other way. You will be out money and just be lied straight to your face!"

I asked for a credit for our experience.  I was told that I had probably picked up a nail on my way to Waveland and I was lucky that they didn't charge me a late fee for bringing the van back late.

I reschedule for November 12 2020 they sent another guy to do the vent count and told me it will cost me $480.00 to do it the price is too expensive for me but I need my furnace cleaning done so I am ok for that and I hope they do a good job but when they came I was so disappointed one guy showed up with a portable vacuum and an air hose that was it. The way they did is hook up the vacuum to the heating duct and sprayed air into every vent about 5 seconds without took the vent covers off that was it. DONE.

I can do it by myself better than that

Ken's crew have been with him for a while (years) and it showed. They worked flawlessly together. In fact a neighbor mentioned how they just flowed and had it down and well organized. Furniture was wrapped and protected. Floors were protected with moving blankets. When the crew said they were going to leave to take 30 minute lunch beak it was exactly that. In fact they were back 5 minutes early and continued with the task at hand. 

But, where Ken and  his crew really shine is they rescued us at the last minute with very short notice.  The day after Ken moved us, we got a call that our rental pod could not be picked up because it was way too heavy and that at least half of it needed to be unloaded. In a panic I called Ken for help. Our house sold and we had to get the pod unloaded and moved.  Ken called his crew (many coming from up north) and within 2 hrs they were at the house along with two 16' moving trucks and unloaded the pod that was filled to the brim. 
Thank you, Ken and crew.  PS. Ken also recommends good movies to watch :)"

She said I had already talked to her. I asked her what our conversation was about. She disconnected me. I called back. This time the owner answered. I asked him why he didn't ring the doorbell to discuss the job with me. At first here refused to answer. When pressed, he said that he did try to get a hold of me. I said that wasn't true.  He said it didn't matter and simply wanted to move forward and asked me what I wanted done. I told him I wanted a paved border for my driveway. He said they didn't do that and simply hung up on me.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"I received a subpar international moving experience through on of Mayflower's sub-contracted companies, Daryl Flood. Upon notification of Daryl Flood that I would be using their services, it took 11 days to be contacted by their international coordinator, despite the companies knowledge that it was a short turnaround to my actual move date at the time (22 May contacted for a 5 June move). This included dumping multiple packets of paperwork on me, with very little or vague guidance, which ended up holding up the entire process. Unfortunately, the actual crews working the goods acceptance and delivery were excellent, but the mid-level staff were terrible, and did not convey what is expected when it comes to an international move, as a company should help the customer navigate the complications of moving abroad from the U.S. This was compounded by continued attempts by myself to contact the international coordinator I was assigned to by phone, only to get email responses instead of a returned phone call. I am an experienced mover, having relocated multiple times while in the military. After advising Mayflower of the situation, they took the complaint but have not responded, making me think they just don't care. So if you want to pay top dollar but receive subpar service, avoid Mayflower or any of its sub's for any of your moving needs. I did more work than the company did, and I paid them."
Home Services,1.5,OR,"I felt they were not working as quickly as they could have. One of the movers apparently had something wrong with his eye that was causing him to spend a lot of time in my bathroom or outside with the water hose flushing his eye out. At one point I offered to take him urgent care so he could get back to work. I felt it was very unprofessional. I feel the team lead should have called in another worker to take his place. The other mover was excellent and very professional as was the team lead. Another issue I have is they disconnected the cables from my TV and I can not find them. Now I have to go out and buy more because my TV will not work without the specific cables. I had boxes clearly marked where they were supposed to go and the mover with the bad eye put them just anywhere.y Some items are very heavy and now I am stuck having to move them to the basement after I paid the company $1500 to move my items.

It had a beautiful view when my daughter moved in, but the view quickly became obstructed with the big crane that is always visible, as well as the continuous construction.  I know they can't help the construction, but the view is not what it appears in their pictures.

In addition, the parking garage safety gate was broken for several months, her vehicle was towed OUT OF the garage for a ridiculously petty reason (many others towed as well) and the management has changed multiple times in the 15 months that she lived there.

But the WORST part was the paper thin walls.  My daughter weighs 100 lbs. soaking wet, she lives alone, very rarely has guests and was CONTINUOUSLY  getting noise complaints and harassed by her downstairs neighbors DURING THE DAY.  Complaints such as ""stop walking so hard,"" ""don't wear shoes when you're walking around YOUR apartment,"" ""stop clanking the pans when you cook,""  ""don't talk when you're on the balcony, you're disturbing me.""  HELLO, she was paying over $2000/month for her rent, NEVER had parties, was very respectful of others and she couldn't walk in her apartment?  And the management did nothing to support her.

Supposedly, they have some no-shows on appointments (even though they were coming to our home) and so they won't come out until they confirm the appointment. Wow!!!

The windows came in wrong and the owner said; 'It wasn't written down, it must not have been discussed"".

The owner also doesn't stand by any estimate given by his salespeople...They gave me 2 estimates for siding, 1 of which I agreed to (and was already fully financed for) The owner came to measure for the job and blatantly disagreed with the estimate. Instead of honoring it like any business would, being I/we had already agreed on the estimate and it was funded, he refused to do the quoted job. Then he spun some story about possible damages behind the siding and liability, what??? That's your whole business, any co. that does siding, windows etc. factors in possible rott/ damages when quoting the job!

They do silly 6 month surprise inspections, will deduct items from your deposit that they didn't fix, slow to fix repairs and not to mention, Sophia is extremely rude and condescending. Everything about them is phony....starting with their home made renters agreement. It should tell you something when you visit their little whole in the wall office. Whatever you do, look elsewhere!! Renters, potential buyers or someone looking to have their property managed will be better off using someone else, trust me. There is a reason they don't have any reviews except for here....they've managed to delete them all. At least they've been able to manage something...they probably spend most of their time deleting their bad reviews all over the Internet. Sad, even the one good review on here mentions they aren't good at fixing repairs quickly and apologized when the requests were lost, lol, how sad is that! Disgusting they even have ""management"" in their title. I walked away regretting renting from them, please don't make the same mistake. I hope the better business bureau shuts them down soon or someone sues them, they shouldn't be in business."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"You've found your heating and cooling experts right here. Look no further!

We had a rough week last week. The house started getting warm and a check of the thermostat and feel at the vents gave us a good idea that the air conditioner was on the fritz. When I went to the fridge to get an ice cream sandwich to cool down, it squished in my hands. That's right--our fridge and AC died in the same night!

I called Homesense the next day and they were able to get out immediately. Unfortunately, our 22-year-old system was completely dead. The very friendly repairman took the time to show me everything wrong with the system and was more than willing to take whatever course of action I wanted--sink varying levels of money into putting a bandaid on the old system or get a new one. I went with getting a new one. Unfortunately, all the sales staff were out that day. But Brian, the owner, didn't want me to go without AC in the sweltering heat we've had lately. So he came over personally and helped me get my new AC order in.

His installation team was out quickly and we had new AC running and cooling the house better than it's ever been cooled since we bought it. Everyone I dealt with at Homesense were respectful, courteous, and quick to please us. I couldn't possibly have asked for a better home repair experience!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"3.5-4 stars. This hotel is very new and feels like it. Everything is clean, modern, functional and in good repair. The rooms are spacious for the price. I like the fact that there's plenty of outlets for charging, the shower is large, theres a big flat screen tv, and plenty of counter space both in the room and the bathroom. The bed is also comfortable. Housekeeping was very good and WiFi was fast. 

A few things I don't like is that there is no door to the shower, so I got cold even though the shower was large and the door to the bathroom would be shut. I also would have preferred glass instead of flimsy plastic drinking cups in the bathroom. The bedding could be improved, it's pretty thin and minimal. I also am not a fan of the marble floors, even though they look gorgeous they are impractical; they create more noise and are cold. The hallways also are not carpeted so there's more noise than usual heard outside the room. There also was a large column in the pathway between the bed and the bathroom; this was probably structural, but it was a nuisance navigating to the bathroom at night. It's a distance to the French quarter which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences.

There are better hotels in New Orleans (like the ritz and harrahs) but this one overall is pretty good."

Williamson County Sheriffs were called and they had us file a criminal trespass complaint so that the offenders get to go to court and talk to a judge and explain how they jump over fences, locked gates, and get onto private property with no appointment, no warning, and will go into your back yard and bang on your back door, which is what happened to our neighbor across the street as well as 2 other neighbors.  BEWARE.  Several formal complaints are filed against this company for what they have their staff doing, as of today....looks like they are casing the neighborhoods to see who is home...Sheriffs were very disturbed by their sales activities...But, sadly, we all think they're being told to follow these aggressive door-to-door sales tactics by their own boss/company.  They have been put on the ""safety alert"" board in nearby Sun City, which has a good 10,000 over-55 residents who will AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"Our hot water heater tripped, unfortunately, we don't know much about water heaters so we called Horizon. We have mixed feelings because one technician was stellar, while the other was not so much. We probably can't even call the second guy a technician because of his poor service, lack of knowledge, and demeanor. Caleb was our first technician and was very knowledgeable, understanding, patient, and explained everything very well. He made us feel comfortable in trusting him to let us know what was wrong with the water heater. Gary was our second technician who came out the next day because we were having water pressure issues. Gary came into our house, did not touch the water heater whatsoever, took a 2-second glance at our water heater and told us we had to replace the water heater completely. We were in disbelief because the day prior, Caleb had told us everything was working okay. Instead of telling us potential causes for decreased water pressure throughout our house, Gary was lazy and just wanted to make some extra money and told us to replace the whole system (a not so cheap procedure). After he left, my family and I did some research and flushed the water heater out ourselves and was able to fix our water pressure problem. Gary would've made us spend nearly $6,000 for a new water heater. Unbelievable. HE PERFORMED NO TESTS! JUST A GLANCE. In one word, we felt disrespected."

From the first contact, Michael was friendly, helpful and a joy to do business with.  Dropping off the car was easy and he called as soon as it was done. Now for the magic part...my upholstery was badly stained from having two young grandkids spilling food and drinks, getting stuff under car seats that wasn't discovered until much later, etc.  Ok, I admit I may have spilled a soda or two myself.  Anyway, the best I was hoping for was to lighten up the stains on the very light colored fabric on the seats.  Well, you would think I had a new car when they got done with it!  They were even able to remove the bluish coloring that had rubbed off from the dye on a pair of new jeans. I could not believe the results.  Moving on to the engine compartment.  Again...WOW! It truly looked like a brand new engine! The nooks and crannies were all cleaned thoroughly, the wheels looked brand new and cleaner than I have ever seen them!

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I am new to the Tucson and purchased a rental property. I contacted RPM Pinnacle and was impressed with the rental terms and their management style as presented over the phone. I hired them and they promptly rented the house at agreed price. Deposit was made and first month rent plus a small prorated sum was sent to my bank account. From then on it has gone straight downhill. It took months to get the utilities transferred into the renters name. I have paid several bills for gas, sewage, garbage and water after being threatened by these companies that they would be sending future bills to collections. A deposit would then be necessary whenever these utilities were put back in my name along with a damaged credit report. I sent copies of bills via email and copies of letters from the HOA for repeated noncompliance, made several phone calls and received very little to no response. My contact has been, please leave a message, someone will call you soon, she is not in the office, etc.  

Recently they changed their name from RPM Pinnacle to Zorion Real Estate and Management. New name new life, pristenne history, or no history.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"My girlfriend and I moved into Riverloft a few weeks ago. The units are really nice and there is a lot of storage space. We face the Schuylkill and the view at night is great. We had both lived in apartments in center city before this and Riverloft was an upgrade in every way. From cleanliness of hallways and rooms, to the friendliness of the staff, and even to the waiting times for an elevator. The Riverloft exceeded all expectations. 

The front desk and other staff are extremely helpful and friendly.The maintenance is completed quickly and correctly for any repairs. Service requests can be added in the portal which is also where you can pay rent. The fitness center is better than both of the other apartments we lived in and saves us money on a gym membership. 

The application process was a breeze and you can find out within minutes if you are approved. 

Honestly, the only negative comment I have regarding my apartment is that it was not ready on Move in day. This is the reason I can't give 5 stars. Luckily, we did not have uhaul coming until the next day and the staff moved quickly to get the apartment ready and clean within 24 hours. We were also credited for the day of rent. 

Overall I recommend Riverloft to anyone who wants to live in Rittenhouse in Philly. It is very clean, spacious,  and has great location,"
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I was more than pleased with the reasonably priced bid, careful supervision, and dedicated crew.  We hired Gosnell Tree and Landscape to prune, thin, and lace three different trees in our yard.  They beautifully thinned and trimmed our front yard olive tree and backyard Jacaranda.  The trees still somehow look full, but so much more light is coming through and we can see that all the dead wood is gone.  They also did a masterful job of crowning a large ficus and trimming it way back on our neighbor's side, but still keeping it as a privacy screen for our side.  I felt that it was a tricky situation, and they spent quite a bit of time trying to make it just right.  Gosnell was careful with my landscape plants as well, and we didn't lose any of our many delicate plants right at the bases of the trees.  Finally, I so appreciated the time Sheridan, their arborist, spent with me on the day he came to assess the job.  He was so honest and knowledgable.  He seemed to know just what we needed and he told me that my fruit trees wouldn't need trimming this year, saving us money.  He also gave me extra tips about some of my other plants.  I felt like I was having a conversation with a long time friend.  All in all, Gosnell was great!"

We were immediately greeted by the most awesome woman named Hayden. She didn't waste any time (which is exactly my style). She took us immediately to the apartment with the best view and we were sold right then and there. 

The best part about Hayden is that we didn't  leave confused on what any of the fees will be ( a lot of big apartment complex try to throw in hidden fees and not let you be aware until you are physically signing the lease. ). So that night we went home and filled out our application and paid the fee. Within the next 2 days we had the deposit paid and everything in order.

A few days later we decided we wanted to switch to a 2 bedroom. She made it EFFORTLESS. There were no issues and she  made us feel no amount of stress at alll. 

We love the apartment so much and she has been so prompt with answering any email we have with questions about things related to the apartment.

I was referred here by Theiss Plating who refinishes all my brass items (furniture, lamps, hardware, etc.) because my brass chandelier was missing the bobeches. I had never been to Brody's and it was the perfect excuse to finally come. Theiss said ""oh, just take this little socket over to Brody's and they'll have some bobeches that should easily fit."" I don't think Brody's even has bobeches.

Upon walking in and waiting for help, I admired the admittedly gorgeous (also wealthy, modern-money cliche) decor. The salesperson seemed perplexed that I was there looking for bobeches. They may have some in crystal but as soon as I said brass/metal, he almost gasped. ""Oh no, no, none of those."" I inquired if he knew anywhere I could find some either online or locally. He had no clue. I mean, this is a lighting place, RIGHT? You'd think I was at a bicycle shop.

I also asked some general questions about a flush mount antique light I was carrying. No help there either.

I sat in the driveway of the other duplex unit and watched them load the truck. One guy stayed with the truck and packed it carefully, like a jigsaw puzzle almost, after each piece was blanket wrapped or wrapped with plastic, and each time the guys brought something to the truck, they would RUN back to the house, which really impressed me..They would have cut an hour off the estimated load time, but the piano was hard to get out of the room it was in (the doorways were not across from each other). They got it done, though. And they finished unloading 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Nothing damaged or lost, and they did put the bed together for me.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"West Clay is a beautiful neighborhood, BUT I'd avoid The Wentworth. I had a neighbor downstairs filling my bathroom and apartment with cigarette smoke and other mysterious smells, and despite working with management and powerful air purifiers and fans, could never get away from it. Then there were ants flooding the kitchen despite being on the third floor and having NO FOOD out - nothing worked. The former management had a very rude maintenance man, as well, so the whole thing was a living hell despite being very patient.

New management came last year, and while they were nice and improved some things, they were invasive, always coming in to my place. What made me move was their forced renovation of every unit. This included up to 3 business days of their own choosing to bring in a bunch of contractors the residents didn't know or choose, replacing some of the carpet, countertops and the rest. This just eroded my trust and was too invasive for me. This is usually done when residents leave after their lease is up, and most people I talked to were shocked to hear of it. Other property managers from other facilities were also dumbfounded or admitted it does happen occasionally, but is very hard on residents. 

It's not the job of property owners and managers to make life hard for the tenants with forced renovations that aren't critical. The new management had a bulldozer mentality, despite being very polite about it."

Long story short - as of this morning (7/10/20) I was informed by cherry hill township that the grand has not applied for a pool license and the board has not made a decision to open the pool yet.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I had a 2-4 arrival time. Although they didn't show until 4:45 they were courteous enough to call me around 2:45 and let me know they would be late which allowed me to get more things done. 

I moved from a 3rd floor (elevator building) apartment to a 4th floor walk-up apartment. I had moved a lot of my things early in the day and had 3-4 boxes, a bed, and a dresser. The move had a small hiccup considering I was moving to Center City. The truck was really big for such a small number of items (I was told it was due to such a large move earlier in the day) and the truck wasn't able to be parked long on the street as buses couldn't get by. After about 45 minutes a manager showed up to assist and all of my belongings were inside and up to my 4th floor apartment in about an hour. They were nice enough to not charge me for the time that no work could get done and they busted their butts to get everything up the 50+ steps! 

I would definitely use them again, but would likely insist that since I'm on such a small and busy Center City street that they bring a smaller truck. I would also like a morning appointment to avoid the hassle of a previous appointment running over.

For the amount of work that went into my move they were worth every last penny!"
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I have used 24-7 in the past, and once again, they didn't disappoint.  While I understand Chuck has since retired, his partner Vicki didn't skip a beat.  Getting ready to sell my home, I feared the worst when I discovered a drip from my bathtub spout.  After researching, I self-diagnosed the need for a new rogue valve, which would have required opening a hole in a newly-painted wall in a newly-carpeted bedroom.  And I knew it wasn't going to be cheap.  Vicki listened to all my concerns and told me Joaquin would be out the next day (today) to assess the issue.  If you're looking for a company who would rather repair than replace, 24-7 is for you.  Joaquin fixed the problem without the need to replace anything in the wall. 24-7 is committed to not selling anything you don't need, and that's exactly the way Joaquin handled the job.  I couldn't be happier with the service or the price. Chuck, you should be proud of the way 24-7 continues to conduct business - I'd recommend 24-7 to anyone in need of plumbing services.  Oh, and not only did Joaquin do an outstanding job, but he also took the time to explain everything and gave me some great tips on keeping tub/shower fixtures sparkling.  Kudos to 24-7, and thanks for the quick response!  You turned what I thought would be a nightmare into a positive experience."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"This company was hired to repair/replace sidewalk for a neighbor whose property pavement adjoins my property. The workers that were sent out were extremely nasty (older guy) racial microaggressions; dumped all
of their work stuff on my lawn and blocked my driveway, and chipped the adjoining pavement of my driveway for the neighbors work next door. I called the D. Liberati office and spk to Lisa; who was nice. The owner (Dino) came out and was extremely rude stating that he wasn't going to fix what his worker damaged; and blamed me saying I was trying to get over on him and threatened to report me to the municipality for U&O fines; all because I asked him to properly fix what was damaged. Fixing it requires cutting out the damaged area. The worker chipped the concrete underneath; so there is a chip on the upside now as well also. The owner placed a black goo substance to cover it up; instead of cutting out the piece over even a sliver of the concrete that was chipped. THAT THEY CHIPPED. Very rude. Poor quality. The new concrete of the sidewalk of the neighbor next door is already breaking. I told the owner (Dino); had his company did a good job, then I would have used them for other things. Now they won't get my business because of the damage that occurred to my property whilst hired to do the neighbors' property; so that the neighbors could sell their house."

It will be very easy to find someone to rent from. I moved from New Orleans to San Francisco last weekend. I'm not sure if I've ever lived in a better place than here. The building is really nice. The amenities are pretty decent. The pool is a nice place to go if you like to swim. I also like the gym and the gym was a good place to start. My roommate also loves the pool. I really appreciate the vibe of the apartment. The parking lot is very nice. The building is very small. I like the fact that there is a small dog park next to the building.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"This company has been out several times to help us with our garage door. Today my technician was nice and polite and on time as usual. He inspected the door and told me the cables were bad and needed to be replaced as the left one was frayed. I asked him why this would happen as the garage door and opener were all new at just over three years old and Precision had already replaced the cables. He said that he did not know why these would be frayed again. That is not comforting as this is why you hire a professional company to repair and advise you on your door. 

And here it comes, $324 to replace something that had already been replaced by Precision on a 3 year old set up. So 37 minutes later the new cables are installed and the tech is on his way. The most expensive cables I found online were stainless steel and full retail was $46. That means the effective labor rate would be over $500 per hour. 

I do like this company but today's transaction was not a good one. If I have to pay $324 every few years to keep having them come out to replace cables they have already fixed I will have $1600 in repair cost for the first decade I have this LiftMaster 8500 set up. Since Precision cannot tell me why this would happen, I will probably call LiftMaster to see what they think."

Home Services,5.0,OR,"I'm such a raving fan of Lisa and Miles! They are absolute life savers.

When I moved from Fremont to Los Angeles I was in a situation where I had to sell my property quickly. I was under major stress and couldn't be in the Bay Area to deal with any of it. 

Lisa and Miles took care of everything for me and made the process smooth and as stress free as possible. From dealing with my HOA to fixing things that needed repair they handled it all, they even sold my condo in under one month during a terrible down market where nothing was selling!

Not only did they sell my condo in a down market they made me a profit! I was thrilled and Lisa was so kind, assertive and helpful. I felt totally supported, understood, taken care of and safe with her.

I've worked with Realtors in the past, and I often felt like they just wanted the commission, they didn't listen to my needs or care about me at all. Lisa and Miles made me feel like family, I never second guessed their suggestions because I knew they were confident, trustworthy and sincere.

If you want a team that will work for you with your best interests in mind then this team is it. They really know what they are doing and are warm and easy to work with. I have referred them and will refer them again and again.

A+ rating all the way. Thank you Lisa and Miles!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Horrible! We had to meet with Joey and Rick multiple times to get the work laid out. We were told 3 man crew, 8 hour days, $100 per hour, and one week completion. We were provided two design options and had to go to Rick's home to pick up the paperwork for the permits because Joey failed to communicate the appointment twice to Rick. When we picked up the permit paperwork, the drawings were the wrong design layout. The work was supposed to start at 0800 on Monday. By 1630 on Thursday, they told me they had done over 30 hours of work. Another contractor (the one currently doing the work whom we wish we would have found first) saw the amount of work and said it was at best 8 hours for a 2 man crew at a slow pace. They tried charging me for a time I was at the home and no one was there working! I had been in contact with Rick for the project since Joey was never available and provided inaccurate information due to lack of communication with his crew members. When I voiced my concern about the lack of work being completed and the number of hours they were charging us for, Joey got loud, boisterous and combative. Rick is a great guy and should go out on his own with a better crew. The new contractors had to remove some of the work Dixie did and redo it to meet code."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Well. second time out and I think the technician fixed the issue however he created another one that I just spent an hour fixing and cleaning up. After snaking my pipes he didn't put the drain hose from my washer back into the drain. I started my washer and thankfully didn't leave the house or go to bed because suddenly I heard water flowing onto the floor. I rushed to the laundry room to find the hose not replaced in the drain and water flowing from the hose onto the floor in he laundry room and spreading to the kitchen. I had to remove wet     padding from underneath my washer and dryer and mop up water and then move out my fridge and stove to clean up water that had spread into the kitchen. I  am hopeful that the pads under my flooring didn't get wet so that I don't get warped floors. While everyone from Hope has been nice, you're 0 for 2 in competent technicians. The first technician that came out attempted to fix one of the two issues I stated over the phone and in person, but did not address the second issue and told me to call if it happened again (which water puddled in garage the next day) Like I stated above, everyone was nice and respectful, however lacked all attention to detail, and effort toward fixing the problems.

My first room had hair in the bed and had a god-awful smell in the room... called the office and proceeded to change my room no problem. Got a new room and still had many MANY hairs in the bed and black specks of god knows what. I put down my own blanket because I refused to lay on that. My mom sat down in the chair and she put her had on the arm rest and found that her hand was in something sticky, the picture I attached shows you the nasty mess on the side of the chair. The bathroom was clean enough but the toilet seat had been melted and that's sad that a huge hotel couldn't even replace the seat. The kitchen was fine but still found spots of stains the housekeeping didn't even wipe down. The kicker was the photos on the wall, while in bed I noticed how disgusting the frames were and had finger prints and grease marks all over them. This hotel did the job but it was beyond being saved because of how completely and utterly disgusting the rooms are kept. I repeat the staff that helped me was great and kind but y'all need to hire a better maid and maybe think about upgrading your toilet seats."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"It's a shame that whoever manages this company is willing to let an otherwise positive experience turn so sour.  While the movers themselves were delightful and courteous, I am blown away by the sheer rudeness and lack of professionalism shown to me from management.  I called to follow up on an item that was lost during the move (valued at $100). While I understand that standard moving insurance is paid by the pound, I was hoping for at least a drop of apology or sincerity. I guess once you pay, you're no longer their problem.  ""The crew assured me it was moved safely to the apartment."" Right... So now I'm a liar? 

The owner is apparently on vacation for three weeks and conveniently unavailable. If I want to speak to him I have to call back - apparently they can't be bothered to take messages either.  

While I was previously willing to overlook the two wall mirrors and antique night stand that were damaged during the move, I now plan to claim for those as well. Yesterday, I would have been right there with the rest of the Yelpers giving Old City Movers a good review, but not after the experience I had today.  

Bottom line: Buyer Beware.  If you want to babysit this crew and make sure everything you own makes it to your new place, feel free.  You'll save yourself the ""pleasure"" of having to speak with management if something goes wrong."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I was dreading getting the windows in our house changed out, but it really needed to be done.  I called a few companies for estimates and braced myself because I knew very little about windows or their installation.  Energy was the first company to come out; Rob Block was very friendly and took a look at all the windows that needed replacing, including a large bow window in our living room that we wanted to downsize (required some construction work, not just pop window out, put new window in). I was reluctant at first when offered a special price if I would sign a contract on the spot.  However, Energy had great reviews on Angie's List and the price was about $2000 less than we expected to pay, so after conferring with my husband on the phone, we decided to go for it.  We got eleven windows replaced, I didn't have to get a bunch of estimates, and the windows were installed quickly, about three weeks later.  The two workers who did the installation were friendly, professional, spoke English, and did not leave any mess behind.  The construction that was needed on the bow window frame was done beautifully.  We're very happy with the windows we received, and got two calls from the company to make sure we were satisfied with the product and installation. I am not usually a fan of the ""hard sell"" but in this case it felt like a win-win."
Home Services,2.5,CG,"The only thing ""luxury"" about this place is the pool. I will admit that it's been pretty quiet since I moved in, but the pool is still the most expensive place to live in the area. I mean, it's a dumpster. If you're looking for a place that is clean, comfortable and has a fair amount of parking, you will not be disappointed. I'd rather have my apartment on the top floor than the ground floor, because it's so much nicer. The pool is amazing, too. The pool is absolutely gorgeous, too. 

However, the rent is extremely high. I lived here for 3 months and it's only $3.50 a month. I have been to a few other places and not to be disappointed. I've had a few issues with the staff, the living conditions, the amenities, the food. The leasing office is terrible, too. I've had the apartment in the same room for over a year now and they have gotten very busy with the other tenants. They do not honor their lease, so you get to choose which apartment you choose, which is a bit of a hassle. The leasing office is so unresponsive that you can't even get into their office."

They showed up on time, worked very fast, and were very professional. They were very professional and professional and provided a great price.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"My mom lived here for 9 years. It used to be great, but since the change in management, the place is terrible. It's cold and unfriendly. Many residents share that feeling. The assisted living is a joke. We paid for showers for years and my mom rarely received them. We paid for med services and had to continuously monitor to make sure that meds were given at the correct time. My mom's doc ordered a stool sample and it took them 6 months to get it. The final straw was when my mom had a bowel accident. My friend was with her and let me know. I called 3 times for a caregiver to help clean my mom and even offered to drive from home and do it myself. I was called and told the caregiver had cleaned my mom. The next morning, my mom was still sitting in her soiled briefs. They left her like that all night. 

Shame, shame on Leisure Care, who is aware of the problems there and allow them to continue. I moved my mom and 12-15 residents also moved the same month. The head chef subsequently walked off the job and numerous other employees have too.

To top it off, nobody from the management team even said goodbye to my mom. They'd take 9+ years of rent, but no goodbye.

I've lived at Seneca Bay Apartments in Bowley's Quarters MD for 12 years. Thru 7 different owners and management companies. Morgan recently purchased the complex. My rent increase was 47.00 per month..And on top of that ..they started with the outrageous fees!  First ,the water bill that was NEVER more than 16 a month suddenly increased to 34 each month. THEN,,,they decided to start charging for GAS to heat the hot water. THAT was always included in our rent. Another fee....17.00 each month!! NOW...a fee for trash removal...total charge with fee,,10.75 each month! NOW mind you..they do NOT have separate meters in these apartments! Those of us who live alone pay the exact same amount as those who might have 6 living in their apartments. All that's left is a fee for AIR and I'm fairly certainly IF they can figure out a way to charge for that..THEY WILL!! They won't tell you that you're going to be charged for these additional fees! That extra charge of almost 60.00 a month could make the huge difference for a person living on a very tight budget. Do yourself a favor and NEVER rent from Morgan Properties!"

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I fell for the trap!  

Initially I had republic services for trash pickup but Whitetail convinced me to switch saving me $20 a quarter 

At first their service was adequate but it progressively got worse.  Pickup times are never the same.  Sometimes they completely forgot my street.  After one year they raised my price ftom $69 per quarter to $84 per quarter.  

I would be willing to deal with all that but after this last incident I had enough.  I emailed them asking them to replace my recycling bin because their truck broke it. They said they would replace it within 7-10 days.  They instructed me to leave it on the street. My can sat on the street for over a month and despite follow-up emails it sat.  I told them that's it and said next Thursday is my last pickup for the above reasons. They said okay leave your cans street visible we will pick them up.  Poof Friday after last pickup they were gone.  So it's not like they are on limited resources.  If they can retrieve cans that quick they can replace them also.  Needless to say I'm back with republic services and I'll never switch back 


Forget about calling them you will never get a live person! 


Goodbye Whitetail

I called them because the fence had been installed incorrectly and they said that the fence was a ""slip-out"" issue.  The next day, they replaced the fence.  The reason I called them was that I was ""just getting in contact with them"".  I had a few other companies install new fence, but this was the first one I had heard of.  I called them again and they said that the fence had been installed incorrectly.  I called them again and they said that the fence was a ""slip-out"" issue.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"My wife and I moved here in 2005.  New to the area, we were happy to find a reasonably-priced apartment in a good location.  For years, we found Austin Crest to be a wonderful place to live, with attentive staff and decent neighbors.  The only odd thing--and this continued the entire time we were there--was random shutdowns of the pool to the entire community because ONE person misbehaved.  Why punish everyone?  (Well, now that we don't live there anymore, I can confess: We'd go up to the nearby Northwest Pool and swim there.  Shh.)

It started going downhill about 2009.  Maintenance requests ignored, lower-quality tenants, deteriorating grounds.  But we stuck around, hoping matters would improve.  Unfortunately, they did not.  We ended up with the upstairs neighbors being loud, the downstairs neighbors being loud, and the neighbors to the side being loud.  By 2012, we'd have enough and bought a house across town.  Turns out that was less expensive anyway. 

Don't live here if you can avoid it.  There are many other much nicer apartments in the area, such as the one directly across the freeway.  (We never lived in that one, but knew a few people that did and visited them often.)

One good thing about the area, though, is its convenience to lots of shopping three minutes away, a park within a five minute walk, and community facilities such as schools, a post office, and a library within a couple miles."
Home Services,5.0,OR,"Kent is an excellent home inspector who not only has the experience and credentials, but also really cares about doing his job well.  We hired him to inspect a home we have under contract, and he was definitely the right choice.  Kent spent 5 hours inspecting the house, then another 45 minutes walking around with my husband to point out the defects.  Other inspectors said they would take about 2 - 2.5 hrs on the inspection, to give you a comparison.  We feel confident that Kent identified all the critical issues with the house (considering the limitations of a home inspection), including some that other inspectors would have missed.  In fact, Kent pointed out a critical issue that isn't normally within his scope and told us another inspector would say it wasn't a problem - and he was exactly right!  

For those of you who are budget conscious, like me, I will tell you that Kent's fee was not the lowest I was quoted; however the difference was really small ($50) and home inspection is not an area where you should skimp!  After seeing Kent work, my husband and I agreed that his services are worth far more than his fee.  He will be our first choice if we need another inspection in the area.  

Laurie, Kent's wife, is very responsive and kind.  He was really booked up when I called, but she took time to follow up until we found something that worked."

There are some things you can't take care of that you can take care of in a large apartment complex.  This building is still far from being the best.  And I know the most common complaint about the building is that the maintenance staff is very poor.  This is not true.  The building is filthy and a crime ridden complex.  The staff is also very loud and obnoxious.  I know that many people who live here are very angry with the management.  I have recently seen a woman in the office yelling at a client, calling her a ""sh*t"" and calling her ""a**hole"".  I have also seen a woman taking a bite of a pizza at the front desk while a man in the front office is trying to get a hold of the security guard.  I have also seen a woman being kicked in the back of the head by a man in the back office who apparently doesn't care that she was kicked in the head.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"This place has gone down hill since the new management company came in. They are now requiring all residents to actually put Lexington on their personal renters insurance. (unethical...YEP).  So instead of Lexington getting their own insurance for the buildings they want residents to use their personal liability to cover their buildings if something happens. PLEASE PLEASE READ YOUR LEASE AND ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE SIGNING!  Its worth the money to get a lawyer or your insurance rep to read it over before signing. 

The gate issue...been complaining about that for YEARS.  The children run around like animals and most of this is the parents are not taking responsibility. Don't ask to get anything upgraded. That won't happen. My air conditioner doesn't work. Have been getting it fixed a few times a month and they won't put a new one in. 

My favorite is their quote ""if you don't like it..leave.""  Instead of working with you for rent they insist that 'everyone has to be paying the same thing'. After 2 days of visiting more apt complexes than I care to count I know that nothing that Lexington said or says is lies. Most places are willing to offer discounts and no one has asked to be put on my insurance policy. 

I can promise that your rent will go up every year thanks to this new management company based in Miami.  For the price, you can get a brand new build up the road on Race track. Go there first."

Home Services,4.0,OR,"As a Realtor I've been referring my business to Rudy Title and Escrow as long as I've been in the game - since 2003. I love that Rudy Title offers aggressive pricing for both Buyers and Sellers. But mostly, I love taking my clients to the beautifully restored historic home with period furniture where Rudy is located in Hillsboro Village. 

In my experience on the Buyer side it isn't so much the actions of the title companies, but the speed of the Buyer's lender that makes the difference. A title company just can't do their job until the lender sends them the lending package. But Rudy has a large enough staff to pull together a settlement statement very quickly on those hectic closings where the documents don't show up until 5 minutes before settlement time. Unfortunately this seems to be the norm anymore in mortgage lender. But that's another topic altogether. 

On the Seller side of a deal, I love that I can get an almost instantaneous quote for title insurance (and reissue credit) with one quick email. I've never had an issue with getting my HUD1 late because a closer was too busy. 

Rudy will also travel all over Nashville for closings if you have a busy professional who can't get off work. They also give clients the choice of paper or cd format for their closing doc copies. Oh, and red or white wine as a gift. 

Kudos to Mary Frances Rudy for putting together such an efficient organization in such a lovely setting."

I recently rented an apartment under their management company only find out they put me in a water damaged apartment and building. A week after moving in I had a live waterfall in my bathroom. When i made the office aware they sent out  maintenance  to patch up the leak, not fix it. Within two weeks the leak traveled to another location in the bathroom. Why? Because they didnt fix the leak. I lived like this for two and a half months. GNATS EVERYWHERE. I got fed up and contacted the office and demanded a resolution. I was EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT TOXIC MOLD EXPOSURE. MY SON had nosebleeds wateryeyes and I had ear aches and throat problems. The place smelled MUSTY. The  property manager's  resolution was to transfer to another unit. I would expect to have had some type of compensation  for the type of apartment I'd been living in, but I just accepted the transfer to get out of that type of living condition. Now I'm in the same building but a different unit and found traces of mold. All I want is for my family to be safe, and to be stuck not know what mold is behind these walls with an active water leak in this building is BOTHERSOME. I would give them a ZERO if I could.

Where the real horror show began was with the painters, they didn't paint half the things they were supposed to paint, they left they house covered in painting dust and paint on all of our things which included new appliances. The workers were rude and expected me to do all the lifting and moving of the furniture and tables, when I didn't they got on the phone with their boss who proceeded to yell at me like I was his employee. Everything they painted my wife and I had to repaint because of giant missed spots and just poor work. When the guy who came out to ask if I was happy with the work they did came out, I told him and showed him all of the stuff they had done and he said that sucks but wouldn't put down that I was not happy with the work that had been done, only left after being bullied into saying I was happy with what they had done.

And then I paid them and you would think that'd be the end of this nightmare, nope. I received a call and email with no bill attached saying I owe them more money.

It was during the hot spell this summer, and they were available within a reasonable amount of time, realizing others in the same position (it had gotten cooler those days). When they came to do the job, I asked the worker doing the air conditioner to block mouse entry holes, detected by the inspector when we bought this house 2 yrs. ago. (Was this an unreasonable request (?) as this would be the time to be able to do such.) He didn't respond when I asked him to do this. Several months later, I added a mortar mixture, where my fingers could reach under the piece that held the unit but not before my mother (who came to live with us a couple wks. before) spotted a mouse in her bedroom; she specifically asked if we had mice because it was always a battle in her prior homes. We hadn't had any mice before this, and I told her so, (likely due to our cat) but I'd found a squirrel skeleton atop a bin. My advice is to train your workers to LISTEN with great care to the concerns of your customers (and tell us you've taken care of it or not) and not just be pros at what it is you do because it will haunt all of us later.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"We are very satisfied with Heritage! 

Our heat pump was damaged by hail from the March 2012 hail storm. The insurance company did not want to pay for a replacement unit. Heritage provided documentation and met with the insurance adjuster to show him the level of damage and persuaded our insurance company to cover the cost of a replacement unit. Every other contractor that looked at our unit said they would just brush out the fins (even though there was obvious damage to the internal coils) as I'm sure they did not want to spend time arguing with our insurance company. We felt that Heritage went above and beyond for a consumer they had no previous relationship with which gained our trust and a guaranteed sale.

Even though we knew we were going to hire Heritage, we received estimates from several other Heating & Cooling companies (as is our standard practice with all home repairs). Heritage offered the best price for the best quality brand we could afford. We received estimates from 3 other local companies that were more expensive than Heritage for much lower quality brand units.   

The unit was installed with 3 days of hiring Heritage for the job. The complete installation was done within 5 hours. The installers were friendly, informative, and completely cleaned up the area before they left. The owner contacted me later that evening to check in and make sure the installation was done to our satisfaction - it was! 

I will definitely recommend Heritage to friends and family. Overall, a great experience!"

Home Services,1.5,OR,"Moved from California last year where we had Comcast, which was expensive but very good service.  We now have internet/phone/cable through Charter and I would say that it is not as good as Comcast.  It is slightly less expensive, and I would rate the internet service as comparable; the speed seems fine but sometimes it does disconnect mysteriously.  All in all I would rate the internet as OK.  The cable is fairly good except for the DVR, which I find TERRIBLE.  The DVR cannot realistically be set up for series recordings, because it records everything even if you ask it to only do New programs.  It can only do two shows at once and you can't watch a third, which is sometimes a real problem.  The playback is iffy...it seems to have a mind of it's own.  Very frustrating at times.  On Demand is also not very good, as you get some networks but not all and not all shows are available On Demand...not by a long shot!

That being said, the channel selection of the cable is pretty good, the picture quality is adequate and the cable is by and large reliable, meaning it rarely goes out.  The box sometimes needs to be restarted, which I guess is normal.  All in all I would give Charter a ""C"".  Compared to Comcast, their technology is not as good.  Installation and support from their techs has also been a ""C""; some of the people quite helpful, others inept and disinterested."

Now the reason they did not get a 5 Star rating from me.  When I normally get an estimate for a job - I want my quote to be one price.  Not ala carte.  I also don't want to be involved in every single detail.  Isn't that their job?  I dealt with a woman named Denise.  When I placed my order I told Denise that I would do the cabinets initially myself.  There was one room that I didn't get to do so I tried to add this on last minute.  I would gladly have paid extra but she said that they could not do it.  They would have to do ALL of the homes cabinets and were not able to do one section only.  It was against ""company policy"".  Really?  Isn't house cleaning part of their scope of work? 
Oh well!  She wasn't going to budge.

I have been thrilled with every single cleaning that we've had, even with different cleaners. I'm always able to text the office the morning of the cleaning to get an arrival time window and the cleaners will send a text when they are on their way. This is particularly great during this time where their policy is to have no one in the house or to be restricted to one room for the duration of the cleaning. I am so grateful and always look forward to coming home after a cleaning because my house always looks fantastic. I would recommend Scrub to any of my friends or family members. I also really appreciate the fact that the cleaners that work for Scrub are considered to be employees instead of independent contractors, which means they get sick days/PTO and are covered under worker's compensation insurance. This means a lot to me since I know many cleaning service companies don't have their cleaners listed as employees and they don't get sick days or PTO so if they can't work they don't get paid or are not covered if they get hurt at work. This was one of the reasons I decided to go with Scrub initially and I'm so glad I did.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"Been  living here for about a year and a half! Luxury apartment it is not.  The carpet is always dirty and needs to be changed.  There are more dogs than people.  Sometimes the complex has an odor because a dog has peed somewhere or because people fail to WASH their dog.  Parking is horrible. The washing machines don't wash your clothes good and are costly.  My clothes never seem completely clean.  The dryers are costly and don't dry your clothes very well...causing you to use more money to dry your things.  One or two washing machines and dryers are always broke for weeks on end at times. Wish I had a washer and dryer in my apartment.  The elevators need updating.  Maintenance takes forever to fix something that is broken which means they need to hire more maintenance staff. Second hand cigarette smoke or weed smoke can become a major issue.  The parking security gate is often broken and there are not enough cameras on the grounds.  In addition, residents' cars have been hit or damaged by other drivers and there is no way of knowing who did it.  Residents' cars have been broken into or stolen and there are no cameras to monitor unauthorized activity in certain areas, especially the stairwell unless you are exiting the building. Something is always broken and need maintenance.   Rent is too high for some problems with this complex.  In the alternative, the staff is nice and friendly. Location is excellent."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Living here has been an absolute nightmare from the get go. Good luck getting anything in your apartment fixed, maintenance is not experienced and will do the most half ass job as possible! They had to come back 3 times for about everything that has needed fixing(everything is done incorrectly). I had an apartment with a washer and dryer promised to me but the day of my lease signing I was told there were ""plumbing issues"" and that I would have to wait a WEEK. Keep in mind my lease was already ended at my old apartment so I was forced to move into an apartment without a washer dryer but promised that there was a laundromat in my building. The laundromat in my building is disgusting and smells like mildew. Those washer dryers never get cleaned out and they charge you an arm and a leg. Half of them are out of order. I've had a water pipe burst in my bathroom, a dining room light socket go out 3 times, bathroom towel rack/toilet paper rack fall off(had to be fixed 3 times, they used the wrong paint around the fixtures), shower head coming apart, broken hallway doors that were too large so maintenance cut into the wall and then put cocking in the gap(looks horrible after two times of them coming to fix it), my refrigerator has failed THREE TIMES. All in a short 8 months.
And to top all of this off your neighbors will probably be loud assholes and there are hardly any sound barriers in these cheap buildings.
Good luck."

If you need a fix, just ask them.I had a house inspection done by the HVAC company.  The inspector came out and told me that the water heater was working fine.  He stated that they would call me back if I needed to do it.  I told him that I was so upset that I didn't get a call back.  He said that he was going to call me back within 24 hours to let me know that the water heater was working fine.  He also said that he would call me back if he could do it.  I don't know if that was a lie, but I did have a water heater installed.  It was a nice surprise to see how it was working.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"If this was anyone else story I would be ROFL, but unfortunately I can't laugh when Florida Central Credit Union tried to use Extortion tactics against me.

In December 2016, I bought a new 2017 Hyundai sonata with Hyundai Financing @7% interest rate. My coworker suggested his Credit Union and low and behold in April 2017 Florida Central Credit Union bought my loan and it's  now 2.25%

I just received a Final notice (don't recall previous letters) from Florida Central Credit Union stating they are going to add some exorbitant (several thousand) amount of money to my loan because they believe I have no insurance. So I had USAA Fax over my insurance binder... problem solved, right? No!!

According to the idiot who responded back they said the Binder we received From USAA started from 6/6/17 and goes to December 2017. The problem still remains... How do we know that you had adequate insurance from April to June 2017? We will still proceed forward.

""Are you ignorant"" I replied. My insurance renews every 6 months and it should of been obvious from the Binder you just received. Furthermore in April, I bought GAP insurance from you to ensure that the principal is paid in case of an accident. How can I buy and you sell GAP insurance if you never saw my car insurance when you bought my loan. You would have to know the amount of my insurance coverage to ensure that the GAP insurance is adequate...

They bought my loan for ominous reasons unknown to me. How else can a financial institution be so blatant ignorant?"

In fact, this helps Power keeps thier prices down, as they don't spend money on advertising, and thus depend on testimonials like this.  I was impressed by the thier product.  A window that is so strong that it can hammer a nail into a 2 x 4?  A window screen that you can stab with pencil and then self repairs?  They gave us a quote for the whole house, and for the windows that needed the most attention.  The salesmen went to the car to allow my wife and I to make a decision, and thus I felt they gave us space to make a decision.  We signed up for 5 windows initially, and then decided to do 5 more and patio door a few months later.  In some cases there was water damage that required new framing and trim.  While the job wasn't cheap, I do think we got good value.  A quality product that met our needs and will last for as long we live in the house.  We have a full calendar year from the initial quote to finish the job, and they do offer reasonable rates for financing.  I'm very pleased with the product, and everyone we met in the process from the salesman, to the installers, to project managers were very professional.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"We had Unique come out to give us a quote for a new roof.  The first guy was a great salesman and talked up their product and 50 year guarantee.  Then with a 30 % off discount, we were sold. A second guy came out a couple of days later just to remeasure and verify the first guy.  Yesterday a third guy came out and told us he was very sorry but there was a big discrepancy in the two measurements and he was going to have to void our contract.  The first measurement was 20 square and the second was 38 square.  The company certainly could not do the job for the price originally quoted.  So the third guy had Eagleview measure our roof and got 32 square which was going to be nearly $50.000.....but he would give us 50% off because of the error.  So we were going to be paying $8,000 more than originally quoted.  We told him that voiding our contract was a blessing because we were told the first price was way too much....AND if three guys can't come up with the same measurement how do we know they will be able to do the job right.  This was a bait and switch just like Larmco (the company that Unique took over) did to us on a walk in tub.  They sold us a 72 jet tub and installed a 6 jet tub.....because it was an upgrade.

I have seen a couple buildings in the Central West End area and another building out in Kirkwood. I am moving to STL for work and this is the only property group that I have found that is actually going into older buildings and making them nice. All of the ""renovated"" or ""updated"" apartments I saw at the other property companies just had new drywall to actually separate the apartments, a fresh coat of paint, and maybe new flooring. The other companies had appliances that are older than me and the layouts were horrendous. Asprient is doing it right. They are updating these buildings and making them luxurious. The appliances, flooring, countertops and overall attention to detail is what I hope to live in many years down the road after a long successful career. I have been talking to Matt and he is to most professional and kind person I have met in my apartment search. He has worked hard to make sure all my needs are met and has been very upfront about locations and what to expect as a mid to late 20 year old living in these areas. He gave me his personal cell number and has been answering my questions at 10 and 11 at night.

Rooms are bigger than average rooms at other hotels and the coffee at the coffee shop downstairs is great. 

About the experience: 
There's nobody to open the door for you (which are pretty heavy). The front desk staff were not exactly nice or interested in us but in their own personal conversation. The room was nice and comfy (especially the pillows we had) but, in the middle of the night you can clearly hear people walking in front of your door. In the morning, we were woken up by some constructions noises close to us and the conversation of the room keepers just in front of our door (every morning!) which woke me up several times. I was on a vacation and was staying up late, I don't want to be waken up at 8 am, thank you. 

On the second day, we called the room service because we had no water from the day 1, and they were confused about us asking for water. Good thing is that we were able to do a late check out! 

Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad hotel at all. It's beautiful and well-decorated. Rooms are comfy, and coffee is awesome. But it has a few things to fix: more organization, nice staff, and room service among others. Good quality for the price. Totally recommended if you have a tight budget. Otherwise, go to any of the luxury hotels that are close by."

Michael explained everything he was going to do in so much detail by the time he finished I told him I have no idea what you're talking about(lbvs). I then asked him would it be ok if I call my dad and he explain everything to him seeing how all of the term he was using I was not familiar with and with no hesitation he said of course.

They politely asked if they could move a couple things to get to my vents and returns. They also took off their shoes and  cleaned up after themselves. Michael even seen water on my floor and asked could he have a paper towel to clean it up. Ben and Michael asked if I wanted to see what came out of my vents before they deposed of it and how maintain everything until my next visit.

We signed without seeing the place because it wasn't ready yet and the only one of that model. So we were stuck. The girls in the office are always pretty helpful. Maintenance comes by when you request and the grounds are kept pretty clean. We didn't like our tiny 2 br apartment for the price plus garage fee. Even though it was similar to the model, it was seriously a cave. We have kids, there's no playground but 3 dog parks and when we'd take the kids behind to run and play in the grassy area, large dogs ran after them more than 3x and they were all large pitbulls. 3 dog parks but the dogs still almost trampled my kids at full speed. I couldn't let the kids play in the drive area because no one stops at the stop signs, so it was too dangerous. We had so many random bugs in the apt. I was good friends with the exterminator by the time we finally left. I actually taped and caulked all of the cracks and crevices myself to help prevent the neighbor's bugs from getting into our place through the walls. But really, other than the place being a super cave, the staff was great. I give it a 3 because I feel like I was sorta roped in by the awesome demo apt and led to believe it was going to be just like it minus a room."

It did. Throughout the tour, he evaluated the stains: the crunchy patch in the bedroom was iffy, but he'd try _______ on it. Nice!
We scheduled the first appointment of the day, so our ""window"" was just two hours, but ended up being 30 minutes, and that was because of the rush hour traffic from Nashville to Franklin, which they called to let us know.  
I camped out in our master bathroom, with breakfast and a long to-do list, but I didn't have time to get much done. They were thorough, but fast! I was very impressed, however, we had everything except for the heaviest pieces of furniture off the carpets.

Home Services,1.5,OR,I could not recommend them any less. If zero stars were an option I would definitely have chosen that. Everything with wheels is either broken off or missing wheels. They hit my walls with heavy boxes and caused dents and scratches. This is a new construction home that was just painted. They hid the heavy items in my garage instead of putting them where I had asked for them to go. I made the mistake of talking to my new neighbor while they were unloading the truck. They broke a crock pot! (Those are not easy to shatter but they sure did it.) And the best part is when I completely reviewed the bill after I discovered just how much of my stuff was broken and damaged they over charged me on almost every aspect of the move. These are examples because there is so much more damaged than what I've listed here. Oh and lets not forget that the guys made sure to let me know that they accept tips and when I asked to put it on my card he simply told me to go to the ATM. Moral of the story is they are the worst movers I have ever used. I have not contacted the company because I have read the rest of the reviews and I'm betting that I will be treated poorly if I do so.  I will now spend hundreds of dollars replacing items they broke. Please please please look elsewhere for other movers and don't provide them with your hard earned money as this company surely isn't worth it.

The hall itself was very spacious and the staff for the most part were satisfactory but Greg made the whole event a disaster for myself and our guests.

When we first talked to Greg, we mentioned that we do not know our final count because we have guests coming from all over the country and world and some might not make it last minute due to unforeseen travel issues or other personal issues and we needed him to be flexible with us. 
What happened was that the night of the event, we had about 30 extra people than we initially thought and the supervisor on duty would not let us serve dinner to our guests until we paid for those 30 extra guests. No problem, I completely understand. However, they didn't accept debit cards, credit cards, nor checks. She wanted Cash and only cash. Who carries $450 dollars in cash in their wallets in 2018 and what kind of business doesn't accept other forms of payment except cash in 2018? I had to scramble to the nearest ATM and leave my guests just to get Cash to pay the remaining balance otherwise we could not serve dinner to our guests. 

Steer away from such a disgraceful customer service oriented business such as this and from Greg himself!"
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Hired Zauli Maids to clean my new apartment we were moving into. I asked Anna the maid to text or call me an hour before she was done so I can inspect it and lock up since my wife and I along with our two babies were living in a hotel 45 minutes away. Anna sent me a message at 9:30pm saying she was done. I came by and she was gone so I briefly looked it over and locked the door. The next day we checked out of the hotel and came to our new apartment to have the movers we hired unload our moving truck. To our dismay, the apartment was not cleaned good at all and the kitchen was fulthy, baseboards were dirty and there were little black curly hairs all over in the house. Because the movers were moving everything in to our 3 bedroom apartment, we had to clean certain areas just to use them and put the boxes and beds where they belong. Long story short, I called and asked for half of my money back since the job was done so terribly. Juliana wanted to send Anna back. I said no because we had to clean up the areas since they were cleaned so poorly. I took pictures and sent them to them as well. I kept telling the owner "" Why would I want her to come back and clean it again if that's the quality of work she performs. I have left messages and now Juliana is not calling back. Stay away from this maid service and use a reputable one."

I wish we could get out of our contract now so we could find a new company before summer. I almost never write a negative review because unless a service is just terrible I chalk it up to one bad day and give them another chance. Today is the second time we have called a week ahead to schedule a routine spray and they can't come for over a week. When we schedule it has to be very planned out because we have to make sure we can get out of the house with our dogs for at least a couple of hours afterwards. That coupled with two work schedules means we have to plan ahead. But even when we do that they never have the availability we need. I am not one of those that expects a company to be able to see me tomorrow- but when I call a week ahead I do expect some kind of availability. Especially when the technician is in our home for a total of 15 minutes on any given visit. We have hardly been able to use this service that we pay every month for because of their lack of availability. If their availability is this tight, I would think this would be a great time to hire another technician. I gave them 2 stars because we haven't had any major pest issues to date.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"If I could give this company negative stars, I would. Please notice how the only positive, 5 star reviews are from ""A Google User"", meaning they are working hard to keep their ratings up by writing fake reviews. Most other reviews are from real people who have used their services. 

Every time I call with questions about my lease or general questions, they are unable to answer them. It's become extremely frustrating dealing with people who don't know how to do their job and are awful customer service representatives. They should reevaluate their training process to better equip the employees to be able to answer questions from owners and tenants or at least be able to find those answers quickly.

Along with calling and not getting any valid answers, I'm always told that I can leave a voicemail. Guess what? NO ONE EVER CALLS ME BACK!!! So, what's the point?

I've basically been told that there are certain things outside of my move-out checklist that will prohibit me from receiving my security deposit back, but they are not being specific as to what those conditions are. It's extremely frustrating trying to pry this information out of them.

I've been with several different rental companies from the East Coast to the West Coast. They've all had their reasonable quirks, but Rincon is not only the worst rental management company. They are by far THE worst company I've ever dealt with.

If that house you saw for rent is the most beautiful house you've ever seen with a fantastic price and is managed by Rincon, do yourself a favor. Drive away fast, and don't look back.

After about 1 year they told me that I no longer qualified because of the previous foreclosed home that they KNEW about and that I had 30 days to move out and find a new home for my kids. Then I asked for my earnest money back since they knew all circumstances and they refused to give me my money back. They took my money, kicked me out of a house, knew all circumstances and didn't give a crap that a single mother with 4 small kids would be homeless.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"Using Tom Adams for flooring was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a contractor. They used cheap subcontractors that didn't know what they were doing and subsequently covered our house in dust and debris, completely damaged the new flooring they installed, and damaged our fridge, storm door, lawn light, wall, and more. I called them multiple times during the installation to tell them their crew was damaging our home and flooring, and they ignored me and told me to let them continue.

It took them 2 weeks after installation just to send any kind of response to my list of complaints only after I bugged them repeatedly. It took 8 weeks of arguing with them for them to finally send a new crew to rip up and replace the entire floor and agree to fix the damages. It took another 3.5 weeks for them to repair the storm door (during which they ruined the weather stripping) all the while hassling me about getting paid. They forced me into a made up payment plan that was not discussed prior or part of the contract by threatening not to honor the warranty.

The floor still is not really leveled to the right specs for the product they installed. They took $600 off the price which wasn't nearly enough to cover the close to $1,000 of obvious damages not to mention unseen damages due to the debris that contaminated our electronics, HVAC, appliances, etc.

They should be embarrassed that it took nearly 12 weeks long to complete what was supposed to be a 1 day job, and even after that long they still couldn't get it right."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"I think what makes a good company is not just how they communicate and execute a job, but also how they face miscommunication and set backs. Climate Pro was extremely prompt in getting back to me and hustled to put me on the next day's installation schedule so that we would have working heat before the winter storm. 

I was waiting for a call back on what time to expect a team and an updated quote to sign and never heard back that day, only to be woken up early the next morning by trucks in the drive way. When I called to say we hadn't signed the agreement and wasn't told when to expect anyone and that it felt unprofessional.... The owner immediately apologized, updated the quote, and even deducted a small amount from the invoice to express his honest apologies for the inconvenience (a gracious, professional, and appreciated response). 

It's easy to feel protective when multiple members of your family are high risk during a pandemic and you're wiping out your savings to pay for an unexpected breakdown of a large appliance and Climate Pro made sure we felt secure before starting the job, including wearing masks even while outdoors. They completed the new install and cleanly knocked out stone to reroute ductwork for a packaged unit in half a day, as well as disposing of any sign of the old unit.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"This by far is a belated review for this property but putting it out there, although I never actually stayed here. 
Several months back (around Nov '16), I had applied for an apartment for rent at this place. I had offered to pay up-front for a few months since I didn't have a job at the time. From what I gathered, they were good with that and did approve my application after my application fee and deposit was paid. I also got a letter in the mail about the approval. 
However, they suddenly needed my bank statements to proceed further. When I called to ask about that, pointing at the approval letter already sent to me, I was told it was part of the process. I was like I was paying up-front and that's why it was supposed to be handled differently. 
The leasing consultant I worked with was nice overall but didn't really know what to do with this issue. Later on, her manager got on the phone, who was quite obnoxious and rude. She went as far as telling me ""We are not going to let you stay here without the bank statements"" although I was clearly accepted as per the letter I received. I decided to back out and get my deposit back. I had also asked for the application fee refund since they screwed up but they refused to do that as well. 
Finally, I got that deposit refunded and went elsewhere to rent. However, it was a horrific experience - I just can't believe they chose to loose a customer just for being stubborn, after having clearly approved my application."

We picked a slab of granite that we loved. Our concern was that there did not seem to be enough material for our kitchen counter job. However, our salesperson assured and reassured us that there was enough to fit our project.  So we gave them a 50% deposit, which was immediately withdrawn from our  checking account.  A couple days later we called to schedule the measuring, we were informed that there was no longer enough granite for our job. Only then did we receive a voicemail from the salesperson blaming his installers for using too much of our material for another job.  In his message, he told us that WE were welcome to search their suppliers to see if we could find another slab of giallo ornamental. THEY did not offer to help us find another comparable slab of the same granite. This was THEIR mistake-shouldn't they be doing the searching, not us!?!

After ten days and several unreturned phone calls, we demanded a refund. Only then was I able to speak with the office manager, Lucy.

Please do the right thing and shut your doors already. Your company represents everything that's wrong and your dismissal of the FACTS show that you actively and purposely steal people's money.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"DO NOT RENT FROM MKC PROPERTIES if you can at all avoid it. They are by far the most dishonest and straight-up incompetent company I've ever dealt with! (And I worked with shady New York rental companies for 8 years, so that's saying something.) They lie as a matter of course about even the most trivial things. There is constant staff turnover at the office, so no one ever knows what's going on. I had 4 different property managers for my apartment in the one year I lived at 822-824 Louisa Street. As soon as one new hire finished training, they'd quit, perpetuating the cycle of incompetence. 
On top of that, they were extremely deceitful during the move-out process, backtracking on guarantees I received in writing, issuing outlandish threats of legal action. Then they made up bogus reasons to withhold 95% of my security deposit, claiming it cost $700 to clean my small one-bedroom. Granted I did not scrub out the bathtub or inside of the oven when I left, but it was pretty clean when I left, certainly much cleaner than when I moved in. I've lived in many apartments in many cities, and this was the only time any landlord has ever withheld any portion of my deposit. They made up similar charges to withhold the deposits of every person I knew who moved out of that building. 
In general, if a building perpetually has openings, it means they can't hold on to tenants for a reason. It's worth it to pay a little bit more rent each month so you're not hit with surprise bogus charges and can reasonably get your security deposit back."

Home Services,3.0,OR,"I contacted Giannone a couple of times to service my A/C, once in 2013 and just last week. The first time was in 2013 when my 3 year old A/C was blowing out warm air. Their technician, who I did not trust, told me that I needed to replace the entire compressor on the roof which I found hard to believe being a newer unit. I had them send another technician out who said the pressures were read wrong by their other tech and it was just the coil that had to be replaced, which cost $1300. My most recent encounter with them was when I scheduled to have my A/C serviced to make sure everything was working properly. The first day they called me the morning of and cancelled because their tech called out sick so we rescheduled for the next day. The next day I get a call in the morning to see if they could come at 11am instead of the 12-4pm window, however I was out of town and wasn't going to be back until 12pm. I get a call an hour later telling me they have to cancel again because there were larger jobs that were more important than a service call. I rearranged both days to be home from 12-4pm two days in a row and both days they cancelled. I can see one day cancelling, not two.  I would not recommend Giannone. I called another company that day that was recommended by my neighbor who also didn't have anything good to say about Giannone. There are HVAC companies out there who offer way better service, pricing, and are reliable."
Home Services,4.5,CG,"I have to rate this company on the basis of their service. If you have a problem with a water heater, call the company. The technician was very nice and professional. He came out and fixed the problem without a problem. I would highly recommend. Great service!  They sent out a technician to fix a problem with my water heater. He was extremely knowledgeable and very professional. I highly recommend them for any plumbing needs!I needed a new home inspection done to address a leaking drain line. I called Mark & Sons and got a call within a few hours. They were friendly, friendly, efficient, and very professional. I am very pleased with the results and will definitely be using them again in the future. I called for a quote for a 3 bedroom house and the manager, Yvonne, was super nice and quick to respond. When I called the next day I got a call that she was scheduling a quote for a new home inspection. The guy, George, was very nice and professional.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"I have used Resnick Plumbing twice since moving into our home 2 years ago.  The first was a couple weeks after moving in - one of our toilets wouldn't flush.  Mr. Resnick was our second plumber, after the guy recommended by my warranty company charged me $200 and then told me he couldn't fix it.  Mr. Resnick came out in the early evening, because I wasn't home during the day, examined everything, snaked our drain out to near the road where it was clogged and recommended I get a replacement mushroom cap to top the pump out drain, which was  only a few dollars at Home Depot.  It only cost $275 and we haven't had a problem since.
This week we realized one of the shut off valves for our outside faucet wasn't working and we had ice under the faucet. He came out right away - called to tell me when he would arrive, evaluated the issue and told me quickly what he would do to fix it.  We also had a guest bathroom shower where the water temperature was always scalding, he looked at that as well.  Within 30 minutes - he told me what he likely needed to do to fix both and it would be around $300.  The work was finished in an hour.  He placed a new value to the outside faucet and told me how to winterize it.  Also replaced the temperature cartridge for the shower.  
Everything was done quickly, professionally, and as he said.  
I've always been happy with his work and will call him with our next plumbing issue."

The owner came and gave us an estimate moving from a two story 1500 square foot twin home. $145 an hour which was comparable to other companies that we looked at. We wanted to use a local company which is why we chose Lee's. The movers complained about having to lift things the entire time. They dame unprepared with one  small truck that didn't fit all of our belongings. Another truck showed up along with two more movers because one of the guys on the crew stood on the truck and smoked cigarettes the entire time. When they left to go to the new house, the driver smashed our driveway wall to the point that it crumbled. They damaged a multitude of our furniture and door hinges at the new home. I called the owner Tim and he said he'd send someone to repair it. I asked him if it would be a mason and he said that ""he'd send one of his guys"". I'm doubtful that being a mover qualifies you as a stone mason. When all was said and done, furniture in the new house, good and damaged, they charged us for an additional mover all due to the fact that the older gentleman on the truck couldn't lift anything and was too busy smoking the cigarettes to bother to help. We tipped the two younger guys on the crew who did the majority of the work and asked them to keep it to themselves. If you're in the market for a moving company, move on and choose someone else. Terrible customer service."

I have had a lot of issues with the maintenance staff. I have had to leave my belongings all over the place because of a leak in the pool and it is now leaking again. The maintenance staff does not seem to care about the residents. They are always there when they are not at work, but when they do not return calls they do not respond to messages and they do not send emails. I have had to pay for a shower and a shower repair twice and the maintenance staff is not very good at making sure they are getting everything they need.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"I have to say the guy working at the front desk was very helpful and kind but the room situation was really bad.  The room was hot and humid so by the time I got my stuff out of my bag and got situated I was sweating.  I hoped that by changing the thermostat it would get better but it never did change.  After about an hour I couldn't stand it any longer and realized the air coming out of the a/c vent was not cold so I tried calling front desk.  No answer so I trekked it down, half in my pjs, to see about getting a different room or getting it fixed.  Again the front desk guy was great and happily gave me another room.  I walked into that room and it was nice and cool but it smelled strongly of mold.  So strong that I only stayed in there about 5 minutes and went back down, completely embarrassed to ask for yet another room, knowing that he probably thought me to be a whining guest, and finally the 3rd room was good.  So, after 2 room changes I was finally able to settle in.  I have never in my life asked to be moved to a different room and I travel often.  So, I'm not just a whiny guest.  I'm pretty sure they have a/c problems and the mold smell was coming from the a/c ductwork, likely from condensation or something of that nature.  They really need to get that fixed so I think I'll choose one of the other nearby hotels next time."

So I told her, ok I'll be over. I showed up and she showed the key to another guy and the guy asked her if she had quoted me over the phone. She said, yeah but I told her I had to see the key. So 3 mins later, she comes and tells me that the key would be $140.00. she said that she thought my key had buttons on it and stated that because it doesn't it would be more. I also told her I had my own remote control that I bought, and she said that there was a 40-60 chance that the remote won't work since it was bought on eBay. So she wanted me to pay $140 for just a car key for a Toyota 2005 Highlander. I told her that I would think about it and that I have been quoted $80 in other places. I called Alpine and they charged me $67 for the key and they programmed my remote control and it works just great. Sadly, I would not recommend this place. I felt like they wanted to take advantage of me. You would think that keys that have the buttons to open the door on the key would be more. I got a duplicate key of my terrain 2011 which has buttons on the key at the dealership for $80. Don't know where they got the $140 from. I'm glad I did not pay this amount."

Home Services,4.0,OR,"Have been very disappointed thus far. I received service from Michael this last Monday (4/23), I had a coupon for $79.99 for two pounds of refrigerant and a system check. My A/C had been short cycling and I wasn't sure what the cause was. After looking over the wiring of the system, my technician (Michael) told me that there was a restriction in my system and he would not be able to charge my AC at all until this was fixed. I was encouraged to contact my Home Warranty service, as the service Michael would need to do fell outside the scope of the coupon I had. I took his advice, even though I still had to pay the $80, and another AC service technician came out a couple days later. They looked at the system, and there was no blockage, my refrigerant was just very low, and the schrader valve needed a quarter turn to tighten, that's it. My AC has been working great ever since. Now I have called several times to talk with someone to see if I can get a refund, since I had to pay the $80 to Intelligent Air and then was told that my unit would require additional service (which was completely false). I'm sure that several people have had good experiences with Intelligent design, but there has been serious lack of managerial follow through as this company has now told me that a manager would call me back three times over the past couple days, and yet I am still waiting. Beware of this company. Intelligent Air, if you read these reviews, I have both invoices, and am just looking for some help."

5 stars for your service and professionalism!I have had a very large plumber come out and fix a problem I had with a car.

They came to my house to install the garage door and the work was completed in under an hour.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"I had three estimates to re-pipe my home, Cass came in substantially higher then all of them, however being that they were a preferred vendor with the remediation company assigned through insurance, I decided to try to work with them.  I asked for them to honor their 11% price match guarantee I saw posted on their website, they told me they would price match, but they would not extend the 11% guarantee.  Anyways, in the end insurance agreed to pay for the work as part of an existing claim so we agreed to use Cass.  

Pros:
-Did the job in a timely manner, completed in 3 days.
-Crew was friendly and respectful.

Cons:
-I was told everything was finished and when they turned the water on we discovered the soldered connections on both of ours showers were leaking and they said they would have to come back later to redo the work.
-Two huge holes were dug in my hard and were never fixed, it would have been helpful if they at least put the dirt from the holes on a tarp for me to fill the holes back in rather then putting it all over the yard taking me hours to rake up. 
-They had to patch a large area of stucco siding from incorrectly drilled holes running the supply line into the house.
-Found multiple scrap parts and food items left throughout the house and cigarette butts on the driveway. 
-The two plumbers assigned to my job told me they had only been with the company for 2 weeks, I would have liked a veteran plumber from the company overseeing the work.
-Poor communication when requesting information prior to the start of the job."

I knew i would have to pay more for the lock, i had gotten locked out of my apartment, well were were promised a 15 minute wait. After nearly an hour of waiting I was about to call to cancel when the guy shows up. He is very curt with me then takes one look at my door and claims this teeny tiny hole near.my doorknob was an indicator that i have a smart lock. I KNOW those are digital and require an app. I live in low income housing fat chance of that being the case. So he claims he needs FORTY DOLLARS PER LOCK plus the 15 dollar service fee. I said no way i can afford that i just paid bills. He was rude and said "" you called a locksmith company and don't even know how.much money you have?"" I snap at him and he shuts up for a second and i hand him my card he wants cash, i tell him if he wants to wait for me to go to the bank he can do that, make him wait like he made me, he begrudgingly goes to get his card reader (lazy sod). I begrudgingly paid the 15 dollars to get him out of my sight. I ended up just asking my neighbor to help me pop my window off so I can climb through my back window, should have paid him I actually got in with his help.

DO NOT go to this company. They are rude, unethical, and complete and utter scam artists. If I could give 0 stars I would."

Nearly nothing was done at the time and they've already been at the apartment since about 9:00 A.M. One guy was in the apartment and he appeared to be wrapping/disassembling things. The other guy seemed to be ""organizing"" the four or five boxes in the back of the truck. I offered that we'd help (five of us), but the guy inside told us ""You can if you want, but it should be our job"". However, looking at how it had been almost 3 hours with barely anything done. We all started to pitch in. We took almost all of the boxes and other light things out to the side of the truck within 30mins, including the couches. The guy that was in the truck this whole time was pretty rude about us helping. He said, ""Where's my guy at? He should be doing this."" By this time it was about 12:30 P.M. We left the ""Heavy"" objects to the movers, which consisted of: A dresser, a mattress, a China cabinet (which they scratched, and were aware of it), and a Dining table (which they broke). It was around 2:30 by the time this stuff was taken down and loaded. We then had to drive the truck 30 minutes to the new house. By the time everything was finished it was around 5:00 P.M.

Home Services,4.0,OR,"Dan earned a one star rating only because he did show professionalism in his interaction with us during our home inspection. The package included a nice binder and a well organized report presentation with nice images. That is where the good ends. Dan missed or purposely omitted reporting a very important and obvious problem area on our roof during his inspection that will cost us thousands of dollars to repair. The images in his report showed the good areas of the roof with no mention or photo evidence of the problem areas.  If we would have had this important information, our approach to the negotiation table would have been completely different. Our priority of home repairs would have been different as well. This would have potentially prevented us from spending more money caused by worsening water damage and the stress and headache of mold testing. We presented the issue to him and he responded by saying he performed a very thorough inspection and there was no evidence of problems at time of inspection. I then provided him with the photo evidence of what he missed or omitted from his report and have yet to hear back. He obviously does not stand behind his work which is evident by his lack of response. In his own words he performed a very thorough inspection and somehow he did not see this problem that will cost us dearly.

Save your time and you money.   This company fails miserably both in service and customer service and is borderline criminal.  I called them to come out and check the operation of a hot water heater that they provided and installed less than 2 years ago.  The plumber they sent could not find our location and called us on the phone for directions while he was parked on our property just outside our fence that has a HUGE sign with our company name on it.  Sad and prophetic.   He diagnosed the problem as bad heating elements advised me they are not under warranty and told me i owed $150 for the service call.  He told me i needed a new heater and the price was $950 installed.  I said that price is crazy as a new heater is only $350 and pointed out that would $600 for installation.  He advised that was the price and i should call the office and talk with them.  Calling there was indeed a mistake.  Emily was rude and extremely condescending.   I decided to call both the manufacturer of the heater and the supply house where it was purchased.  A couple of phone calls later and they provided me with a brand new water heater free of charge. Seems to me they were trying to rob me all along.   If i was able to get the manufacturer to provide a new heater it makes perfect sense that they could have and should have done it on my behalf.

Obviously we're students and have no means to take legal action and we just got screwed to these guys could cover their asses and were continually rude and disrespectful on the phone about it. Specifically Blake. If you have to deal with this guy good luck. Not sure what level of education he has, but it really is like talking to a fifth grader. Knows nothing about the properties they have and expresses no understanding of responsibility to basic logical reasoning. They also jumped their prices up for some of their properties by like $1000 from what they are normally to make up for some losses and because they know that college kids probably aren't experienced enough to protest, then they lied about the reason the prices went up. Avoid these guys as much as possible, they will take advantage of students, and then screw them over when possible. Almost all the houses suck too. Very sketchy company. Blake stop calling my roommates to complain about how I'm calling you out."

They said they were going to be a few more hours. I told them that its not acceptable to come that late. They needed 4 hours to load up apparently. The guy told me that was my only option because they had other pick ups the next day...Once they arrived... .they were trying to charge me more. My quote stated the truck would be loaded and later weighed. I was told I would probably get money back because they gave me a high estimate. I was now beijg told it went by the actual # of items loaded and by cubic feet. After lots of arguing they agreed not to charge anymore. I told them upon reserving the truck that I needed delivery on Friday morning and was told that wasnt a problem. On Wedneday I called to confirm drop off and was told they wouldnt be delivery until Monday because of a Holiday.They had been pre paid in full by my company...which I do not reccomend. Afte rabout 5 phone calls to many different people they agreed to deliver Friday from 9 am - noon. All day long they kept telling us sorry, but it'll be two more hours. I felt they were dicking me around and holding my stuff hostage. They finally deliverd at 7pm on New Years Eve. They were 7 hours after the window.

Home Services,2.5,OR,"I would like to thank Dodge Moving and Storage, as well as our driver (Kelvin) and our packing help (Red and Doug) for the extreme honesty and professionalism that was extended to us during our move from St. Louis Missouri to Charlotte North Carolina.  

In the frenzy of moving, we failed to remove and pack (on our own) four extremely value coins and our sentimental keepsakes; leaving these items to be packed and moved by Dodge Moving and Storage.  We did not list them on the ""high value"" inventory list or even mention to our drive Kelvin that they were of importance.  

When our household items arrived in Charlotte,  and these items did not appear to come off the truck, Kelvin took great care to inventory our entire (10,000 lb, 300+ box) shipment.  When the items could not be located our move coordinator (McKenzie), her supervisor and the drivers dispatcher (Matt) began researching the missing box.  

At every step of the process I was reassured that this box would be found.  Despite our fears that the worst had happen, Dodge Moving and Storage sent a second moving crew (based in Charlotte) to help us re-inventory our entire shipment, once again with the complete assurance that the box would be found. 

We watched as box after box was rechecked, and a half hour into the process, the missing box (one of 300+) was located with all the contents in place.  All four coins, irreplaceable Disney memorabilia, family heirlooms from the early 1800...  all was in the box.

We can not begin to express our deep gratitude to Dodge Moving and Storage and all the individuals who moved and packed us."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Well, I am certainly baffled by my experience with Norm. Given all the good reviews, maybe he is having a bad month? I called him and arranged for a moving date. I told him I had several furniture items and the rest would be clothes, kitchen stuff, etc. he said he was free on the Thursday I wanted to move. Norm said he would call me the day before. I was expecting a walk thru and quote. When I didn't hear from him, I called him the night before the move. I asked him to bring some extra boxes. At that time, we discussed him bringing boxes for clothes, books, etc.
He showed up this morning with two trucks and 5-6 guys. Complained that he was tired and had been up since 530am preparing for my move. He took one brief look at my house and decided he didn't want to do the move. He said he and his team didn't pack, they only moved already packed boxes. He was unhappy that I had things going into storage that were not packed in boxes. I wonder what he thought the boxes he was bringing were for? He said he didn't have time for my move, he had booked another move later that day. He said, ""This move will take all day!"" I replied that he had told me he was free that day. 
Anyway, now I have to start from square one, postpone closing, pay the buyer for the time I am overstaying and find another mover! Please exercise care with this company. Insist on a walk thru early enough that you can arrange another mover. And hope that Norm still feels like doing your move on moving day....."

Home Services,1.5,OR,"Used 1-800-Pack-Rat to move and store for several months our furnishings.  Long distance move from GA to NJ. Units appeared in good shape upon delivery in GA however when we received them in NJ (and after finding out they never moved our units to NJ as promised and instead stored them in GA all along) we discovered 1 was damaged/in poor condition upon arrival which caused water/mold/mildew and all of our belongings to smell horrible.  It was so bad that my stainless fridge developed stains on it!  Bedding had mold on it, clothes deemed ruined by their own adjuster and all the sofas and a newer mattress were damaged.  The company offered to only pay for a very small fraction of the actual claim to supposedly ""clean"" some items after taking nearly 6 months to even respond with any offer at all.  They refused to provide any basis for their offer and would not provide any of the reports they say they had on our unit.  We really don't even know what they were supposedly offering to clean.  Their local team promised that the company would take care of our damages when they picked up the unit (which we unloaded in under 48 hours to do them a favor since they were short on units) and saw the damage, the mold and how horrible the container smelled.  A very disappointing experience after trusting this company with tens of thousands of dollars worth of belongings to have them nickel and dime us after ruining our belongings.  The basis for their offer: we're still unclear because their adjuster would not provide estimates or reports she said the company had in their possession."

We met them at the Philadelphia Flower Show, and since we'll be needing a new roof in a couple of years, we decided to find out more and request an estimate.  Two times at the last minute, they cancelled. The first time we were told they running late and had a job that was taking longer than they expected. No problem; it happens - so we said later that day would be fine. A few hours goes by and we get another call - still held up and couldn't get here until 8 PM. Our schedule didn't allow for that much of a delay, so he told us he'd put us on a ""priority list""  and would call again when they were back in the area.  

A few weeks go by .... we heard from them this past Friday - they said they would be in our area all this week and were pushing to get an appointment.  So we set it up for today (Monday) Got the confirmation call at 10 AM.  Rep asked several times if we would both be home (obviously to make sure it wouldn't be a one legger.)  Fine. We would both be here. The appointment was for 2 PM today - got a call around 1 PM and yet another rep informs me that they weren't even going to be in NE PA today - they were down in Philly.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"We had windows replacements put in throughout our house in August 2018.  As mentioned by other, windows were expensive and sales pitch was extensive.  Overall a good experience though. 
This past weekend my wife pulled open the shade in a now vacant upstairs bedroom to reveal a shattered lower pane of glass.  There was no evidence of the window being struck from the outside (window screen is fully intact), and as mentioned, the room has been vacant for months so no contact from inside either.  That said, the sales pitch touted these windows as shatterproof and able to withstand hurricane force winds, so not sure what could have caused this to happen other than a manufacturing defect on a 2 year old window.

Called Power and received excellent service from one of their representatives.  Reason for the poor rating is the result of this call.  I have to pay a fee to have window pane ordered and replaced, and must wait until JUNE to have the work done!  I was told the delay was based on the manufacturer's schedule.  5 months to have a shattered window replaced?  My payment needed upfront just to order the window? 
 No one from Power to come inspect the damage and infer a cause?  No alternate solution in the interim?  I live in Pennsylvania and it's January. 
 Fingers crossed no further damage occurs while I wait until June for resolution.

If you are selling a premium product at a premium price, I expect premium service in case of an issue.  Not sure where else to turn for a response so I'm posting this review, hoping it helps myself and others in the future."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"Contacted AmSteam for carpet cleaning at our condo. I chose this company as it seems to have positive reviews. 

When I made the booking, I was very clear that we had two bedrooms, and a combined living/dining area that needed to be cleaned. I was quoted $160 and booked for the cleaning. Because of the floor I'm on, they have to use their portable machine, and assured me it's much better than the portable machines you get at a grocery store.  I asked if there's anything I need to know before the cleaning, and the lady told me to just make sure all my breakables, plants, lamps, etc. are off the floor.

We moved the majority of stuff out of the way, and put it all wherever there is not carpet. The technician called at 10:40 to say he'd be there right at 11 (we were given 11am-3pm window so this was awesome). The only small hick-ups I experienced when they technician arrived was his quote didn't say anything about the dining area (but he still honoured the quote), and he needed access to our bathtub to fill up his tank. It would have been nice if I was told this in advance, as I had moved a bunch of stuff from the bedroom into the bathroom to get it off the carpet. It was a quick fix, but honestly would've been avoidable if they tell you this when booking. Maybe it should be common sense, but I've never hired someone to come clean our carpets before so I don't know how their machine works.

The carpet looks great and our technician did a really good job. He was done in about an hour.  I would definitely recommend using AmSteam."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"In the middle of a heat wave, our rental, had the A/C go out. My son lives there with his wife and 3 small kids. They were miserable and hot. After they called me, I got on the phone and went to two companies I have used in the past with no luck. Then I got on the phone and called just about every company in town. They were getting ill in the heat and we needed help.
I had one company tell me they had 82 calls on their voice mail so that was out. Now I knew we had a serious problem. So I got on three waiting lists hoping that we might have a chance in a few days to get a repairman.

Three days go by and on Monday we got the call from Silver State that they had an opening the next morning. What a relief. They actually put my name on the list and got us a spot. 

The repairman was out their just after 10am (we were told between 10 and noon). The only thing which would have been better would have been if he gave us notice as we told the office to have him call in advance so my husband could meet them there. But it all worked out and we were just so happy to have his help. He took care of the fan issue and got it running again, thank goodness. I don't think the kids or my son would have made it another day without heading to a hotel. 

Repairman was prompt, friendly, and explained things so that we could understand it. If we have any other issues with our son's unit or ours, we won't hesitate to call them again."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Many more negatives than positives. Non-smoking policy is a joke; I can't have my windows open because of the neighbors smoking on their balcony. The appliances are cheap and inefficient (no microwave included), much lower quality than one would expect for the high rent, especially if you're not in an upgraded apartment. The apartments are handed over uncleaned; I was told the carpets would be professionally cleaned before moving in but they weren't even vacuumed (as evidenced by the pet hair and visible trash left behind). Most of the screens are damaged, one of the windows is missing a lock and the sliding screen door to the balcony won't open--all of which went unnoticed at the move-in day ""inspection"" so I fully expect to be unfairly charged for those damages when I'm lucky enough to leave. When given a tour of the apartment I was told that lots of little ""extras"" were installed for the manager's friend so I was getting a great deal (like a ""special"" paint color, window shades left behind by the ""friend"", no pets, ceiling fan...) which is a blatant lie--for example, their website lists window shades as an included feature. There is a non-optional ""valet trash"" fee not included in the rent so expect to pay an extra $25 every month. And if your lease is ending, make sure you have a new place lined up well in advance. They require you to give 90 days notice if you're not planning to renew your lease. I made the biggest mistake of my life by panicking and renewing my lease, even when they decided to raise my rent. Don't bother emailing anyone in the office, unless it's to get money from you, your messages will go ignored."

They were on time as can be, and they went straight down to business. They climbed my mountain of stairs, well, I'm on the third floor, and walked back down them with my belongings, my bed, my heavy stuff, my endless boxes. They were very good and efficient. 
These guys do not want to prolong their stay with you, and thus you pay more money for them. They want to fill their truck asap get to the destination, and then move on and do as many moves as they can. That is much appreciated.
When I went through different moving companies and gathered my wonderful quotes, I came back to these guys and showed them my quotes. They worked with me to get a quote, and price I was happy with.  They always answered emails and phone calls promptly, and there was no problems or stress whatsoever.
When you are moving, that's stress enough. You can be able to choose Big Boyz moving, and not have any stress. They will take care of all the work for you. You pay it for a reason, so you can ensure they will make sure they deliver the best service possible.

If you are looking for a new home in the area, look no further than the Tysons. The property is located in the heart of the city, near the busy downtown and is a great location for residents and business. Our most recent experience was with the property manager at the office. She was very professional, courteous, and extremely helpful. She gave us a very detailed list of requirements that needed to be met, and we were happy with the results. She was very responsive to our needs and made sure that everything was in order. She gave us a lot of information on what we needed to do to get it done and she was very professional and helpful. I would highly recommend Tysons for any property management needs. We are so happy we found them. I have been using my local service for over a year. I have had a total of 4 different service companies, but have never had any issues. The process of getting service is easy and efficient, and the team that I have had is exceptional.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"February 2020
They called me earlier in the week to reschedule a cleaning for an earlier time, I told them that wasn't good for me but I good do another time during the day. They said no we will just keep the appointment. Then 20 minutes before they were supposed to be here they called to reschedule for an hour later. This particular day was important to keep a schedule. So it just didn't work for me. They claimed it was an emergency, but I can't for the life of me figure out what kind of house cleaning work would be an emergency. So, now I have cancelled their services all together. I feel that they disrespected me and my time for not providing more notice and not changing it when they had the chance. I made plans around it. Oh well, I can do it my self. They were ok, but would miss things I usually ended up having to do additional cleaning before and after. 


December 2019

I decided to higher a cleaning service to do a deep clean at my house and then maintenance cleaning thereafter. Nancy's team Jessi, Sandra and Teressa did a great job. They cleaned our four bedroom three bathroom house in 2 hours. They did a great job. The quote I received was the cost. It would have been ok if they stayed a little longer and charged a little more to get a little more cleaning in, but that is ok, most people would probably complain about that. I called a lot of agencies prior to higher this one and the cost of services is competitive and reasonable. Will definitely higher them to continue with the maintenance cleaning. This will make my life so much easier."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I have had nothing but problems with this company. They installed an energy efficient unit I purchased in Aug 2010 for 5 grand.  All was fine until Dec when only one room was heated and rest of house was cold. Placed service call and tech said unit was fine and increased the number of times the unit to kick on from 3-6 times an hour.  Still no help PLUS my heat bills more than DOUBLED.  It wasn't till June of 2011 that my house wasn't being cooled and it was told me that my duct work was laying on ground of CRAWL SPACE..the tech on first service call never thought to look UNDER crawl space.  So do to not doing their job correctly and taking 3 DAYS to fix duct work my unit is not breaking down left and right costing me over 3 grand to fix on a 3 YR OLD UNIT!! Even the Bryant corp told me my system wasn't a lemon but ""abused"" due to their lack of service quality. Reported them to BBB and all they wrote back was how I was rude to people and NEVER ONCE acknowleged the facts about their inept service and rude supervisior Shane. The owner is pretty nice and a good guy but this ""Shane"" never told him of my problems! DON'T WASTE ur TIME and especially your MONEY to this ""company"". I agree with John M..two thumbs waaaaayyy down. 

Good luck getting them to answer your phone calls after hours. they close at 3:30 and most people don't get home till after and find their HVAC has problems. You may but mostly MAY NOT get returne phone call and if so..you pay after hours time to them."

Home Services,2.5,OR,"My neighbors use Sila.  They love them. I don't.  

I had Sila come out in the spring to service the two units I have in my home.  General maintenance.  They spent less than 1 hr and charged me $1,042.62 for changing the AGW blower capacitor and cleaning the first unit coils plus a one year maintenance program which I immediately canceled 
($198.00).  

They did not do what I called them to do.  General maintenance. They did not clean the water pan or condensation lines. The reason I know this is we recently had a bad condensation leak 4 months after Sila serviced our units.  The new HVAC team I hired said the pan and lines were filled with algae.  It made me wonder if Sila ever checked those pans or condensate lines in the two years I used them.  The charge from the new team was $191.00 for 2 hrs of work.  I thought this was really fair. 

My observations on Sila is they spend their time mostly filling out their ""Customer Solution Sheet "" forms and try to sell you product.  The form gives you levels of treatments and the cost associated with the treatments.  I called for basic service  for my two units and they gave me a form showing pricing from $1,042.62 to $1,848.62.  

Two years ago they said my first floor unit was going to fail and wanted me to spend close to $10,000.00 for a new unit. They said my neighbors were changing theirs and we should change ours.  Well, that unit that was suppose to fail is doing fine two years later and my neighbors make 3X more income than I do."

Home Services,5.0,OR,"We contacted K-Nine Solutions about our rescue pup Murphy. She's a border collie/queensland heeler mix that needed help in her people skills department and a good boost in confidence overall. We had already gone through a basic obedience training through the humane society, but found it was lacking in the personal care and attention we needed with her situation. After our several months of training with K-Nine solutions, Murphy passed the AKC Good Canine Citizen test, and my husband and I both feel much more confident in how to handle her in situations that would have otherwise triggered negative behavior. Murphy has learned so much through her time with K-Nine solutions, but just as equally it has taught and trained us in responsible dog ownership. 

The combination of correction and positive reinforcement has worked wonderfully for Murphy, and though she probably on a life-long journey to learn to trust strangers and not fear ""scary"" situations, we have definitely gained the skills to ease the process, keep ourselves and her calm, and strengthen her confidence. Where before she would back away an cower when a new person tried to offer her a pat on the head, we know how to set her up for success by putting her and other people in the right position. She accepts head scratches like a champ now. I wholeheartedly recommend the team (Eric, Kai, and Justin) at K-Nine Solutions. We had the opportunity to work with each of them during our different training sessions, and they are equally skilled and in tune with how to address you and your dog's specific needs. We look forward to working with them more in the future, and know you will not regret the time and money you invest into this wonderful business!"

Susan, Ruth, David! I was completely convinced when I first talked to you guys and you undercut all the other companies prices by two grand ($$!!) that you were a fly-by-night company that was going to lose/break our stuff and/or slap up with crazy hidden fees after you got our stuff and could hold it hostage.
I was BLISSFULLY WRONG!  Everyone I spoke to in Florida, most especially you three above, were calm, understanding, consistent, and truthful, even when we were hysterical. The cost stayed the same the whole time, no hidden fees or mysterious price changes-----what I was quoted was exacted what showed up on my Credit Card.
The moving guys in Brooklyn showed on time and were great, babying a PIANO down 2 flights of winding tenement stairs without nary a complaint.
We were alerted when our container arrived in LA, and my wife was able to easily arrange access with you guys to get some things she needed for work.
And then you (David I'm calling you out!!) went out of your way to smooth out the moving of our belongings from the warehouse to our new house when it got complicated - including the darn PIANO....
And once again, the moving guys were on time, careful and sweet dudes.
So thank you all for blowing up my pessimism about moving companies, (well just yours) and leaving me with an absolutely boring story to tell about our cross country move because nothing went wrong.....

You know most people that work in these business will walk into your door trying to sell something sometimes they don't even understand themselves.  That wasn't James!  He made me feel safe that what he was saying it was actually the truth.  He was educated in regards to his product, as well as the mechanics of it and how much better would my AC perform whether I was to fix the problem which it would last me a couple more years or replace the unit, which it was my final decision.  He walked me thru all my options and the cons and pros of each! It was a smooth process.  Installation was the same, Peter and his helper were awesome, and very knowledgeable as well as courteous and were up to answer any questions, and they even cleaned their mess, in spite of me telling them to not worry about it!

Home Services,3.5,OR,"I've been a loyal customer of Ashbuster's Chimney service since buying my home six years ago. I have had to bring them back too many times to either redo something they did badly. I spent over $4000 to prepare my chimneys to burn wood safely with Ashbuster's. My chimney's were NOT in bad shape, but I followed Ashbuster's advise - or fear tactics? The initial visit included a camera inspection, cleaning, adding a new material onto the floor of the chimney, and blowing a fire retardant coating inside the chimney. I also asked for the installations of a closing flue at the top of the chimney (to keep birds out and my heating/cooling in). The flue top had to be repaired/replaced and the floor coating had to be redone 3 times. Smoke still comes inside my house when I have a fire (why I hired them in the first place) and when I asked them back, because I can't even use one of the fireplaces (after spending $2000 on it) they told me without hesitation that the baffle needed to be removed for the smoke to travel straight up and not into the room. Why didn't they present this as a possibility before I decided to spend the original $2000? They wanted to charge me even more money to remove the baffle.... and when I asked the owner to compromise his price by 30% he stopped correspondence with me. So, I cannot use the fireplace I spent $2000 to be able to use it. I feel Ashbuster's is in the business of doing poor quality work, while enticing clients to trust them, in order to continue charging more money for future work that wouldn't be necessary if the job had been done right in the first place.."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"I bought a car and drove it from NYC to Philly without a problem. But after I got home I somehow activated the alarm system and could not step on the brake without my car siren sounding obnoxiously; essentially, I had a car that I couldn't drive. Contacted AM&PM yesterday and had an appointment for this morning for the car to be looked at; also, I wanted to make a spare key since I was only given one master key. 

Well, I think I was somehow lost in the system because the technician did not show within the time frame. But after I called back I was told that he would be there within the hour, and everything went uphill from then on. Shay was courteous and professional and disarmed the alarm system and made a transponder key for me in no time. The key cost $145 (so it's definitely more than what the previous reviewer paid for but I think it also depends on the car; I think $145 is still reasonable for a transponder key though); all in all I got me a new key and a drivable car for $225 so I think that was pretty decent. I am satisfied with the service and will use them again if I ever have the misfortune of experiencing lock problems in the future.

Edit: Not even 20 mins after this review was up Shay called and apologized for being late to the appointment. He stated he would refund the service fee. I was very surprised and pleased that he took the time to look at the reviews and actually cared. As I said before, I was satisfied with the service because AM&PM really knew what they were doing. But now I'm impressed at the customer service as well."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Bait and Switch!  
Unsolicited, Autumn Fish showed up at my door a few weeks ago and said Beaver was in the neighborhood on another job and wondered if I wanted a bid on trimming several over-grown oaks in our backyard.  I figured it can't hurt to get a bid, so I said yes.  The bid was actually pretty detailed and a decent price, so I said yes and signed the contract (receipt) .  We set a date for the work to be done.  As scheduled, Autumn and his crew showed up at our house this morning.  First thing Autumn said was that they probably weren't going to be able to do the complete job as bid - he had made a mistake on the time needed to get everything done today.  Instead of trimming 5 oaks (per the bid) they were going to only get to 3, maybe 4 of the trees.  Evidently I miss understood what Autumn was saying and what Autumn meant.  I thought he was saying that they would need to come back to finish the job as bid.  I was late for an appointment so I left the house.  About 3:30 this afternoon (pretty short day) Autumn presented my wife with a bill and said they were done and he needed to be paid.  She paid the bill, as she assumed everything was complete.  Evidently they're not coming back to finish the job.  In the end, they did get to 4 of the 5 trees and did an ok (not great) job.  Either Autumn needs better training on bidding or it was an intentional bait and switch tactic.  Either way, it's a pretty poor way to conduct business."

Home Services,2.0,OR,"Original Review: 

I wish we had gone with another company. Still waiting on the correct size screens and the caps to be placed in. I won't talk to them because it just makes me angry as their customer service is seriously lacking. My husband has called multiple times to make an appointment with no one available and no call back. We like the windows, but we would have been fine with what was at the time our second choice.

Throughout the entire 6 month process there have been delays. We understood that they had a lot on their plate after Irma and that they had issues with their new facility flooding, but instead of owning it and just letting us know, they ignored us. When we were able to reach someone we were always given a new timeframe which inevitably would be delayed

Update 10/09/18
We now have our appointment for the caps and the screens.  It's another couple weeks but we're used to that. 

We do like our windows and I really wish that I could give them a better review, but the experience was frustrating and stressful.  An additional irritant is that they've already received their money and we've already started paying for something that they haven't even completed yet.  

I did receive an apology from a New South representative regarding my review and I am appreciative that they have acknowledged my experience.

Update 10/26/18

So as of today, the job is still not completed.  

They were able to fix some of the screens, but there's still one that doesn't fit and they have to make a new one. 

If we could turn back time we would go elsewhere.  Their inability to own up to the issues and communicate to their clients is frustrating and time consuming."

Home Services,5.0,OR,"Although our family is very much still ""in process"" with our NOLA real estate solution,/dream, I am so glad that I found Jean-Paul and Villere Realty. Just a few months earlier, I called an agent with a larger firm but she was somewhat negative about my goals. From a Zillow ad/listing, I spoke to a second agent but she seemed a bit too aggressive -- I was just not feeling it.  

When I made my first ""cold"" phone call to Villere Realty I immediately got Jean-Paul on the phone. He was funny and cool and positive. He made me feel welcome and realistic in my goals.

After that first call I felt the match would be good, and, now, after one in-person meeting, a recent property viewing, and tons of timely and helpful emails, I know Jean-Paul is the right person -- and Villere Realty is the right real estate firm -- for my family. 

The journey has just begun, and I am glad Jean-Paul is my guide.

UPDATE: Today we are in the middle of our purchase process and Jean-Paul has been a marvel. His cool confidence, good humor and patience are remarkable...and just what our family needs to move through the complexities of a New Orleans real estate purchase transaction. I just cannot imagine anyone else helping us through this!

UPDATE 2: We've closed on our darling dream cottage in Uptown New Orleans. Once we found the right property (be open to various options!) the process was very positive. Due to the 'super powers' of Jean-Paul and his team the offer & closing process went rather smoothly: we were able to close on time at the right price! Timing is everything in real estate (particularly in NOLA) and you want someone like  Jean-Paul who is highly responsive and market-savvy."

Home Services,5.0,OR,"I have never experienced customer service on the level Lifetime Roofing & Rennovation provided me. We were in the process of a quick closing, and during our inspection period the building inspector suggested having a roofing company come out to look at our 82 year old tile roof. After trying 10 other roofing companies that couldn't squeeze me in to hit the inspection deadline LRR told me they would definitely come out and look at it for me.

The next day, I met Matt S. out at the house and when he got up to the roof he realized just how bad the roof looked. He said it was probably best if he had his boss, Shawn, the owner of LRR come out and look since he was versed in these kinds of older roofs, just to ensure we knew what we would be asking for from the seller.

Sure enough, it needed to be completely replaced. It had significant hail damage, unknown to the seller because she had been renting, and they said they would be more than happy to work with the seller with her insurance company. Unfortunately the seller chose to go with another roofing agency but Matt still called to see how I was doing and how everything was going. 

The care and attention this company, and Matt S. specifically, gave to me was more than I ever expected. I have never felt so important to a company. Beyond all of this, they would not charge me! They came out to my home twice, wrote a full inspection report, called me to check in multiple times through the process and didn't charge me a dime. 

In the end, we did not end up purchasing the home but I know 100% that they have found a lifetime customer in me!"
Home Services,2.0,OR,"RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!   The absolute worst moving company. I have moved many times across town, across country and across the world and I have never dealt with a dishonest  company like this one. The sales team seemed very knowledgeable and courteous. They asked for a complete inventory of my belongings (2 bedroom condo, no appliances or big furniture). After a detailed conversation, the sales person informed me that an average 2 bedroom condo would take 4 to 5 hours for the across town move. She gave me a special hourly rate of $119 per hour. So about  $600 which included wardrobes and wrapping the furniture. Well 12 HOURS AND OVER $1500 LATER, A TORN MATTRESS AND CRACKED DRESSER, I WAS ONE DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER. Then I had conversations with Frank. HE INFORMED ME TO LOOK AT THE CONTRACT. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T SIGN ANYTHING. HE SAID IT WAS ON THE CONFIRMATION EMAIL. I told him I would dispute the charge and write a bad review. He said they would put a lien on my belongings. 2 days later I had new furniture delivered by Malcom a recent employee of Big Boys. What a coincidence!   He informed me that he left the company because of their questionable practices. He said he was instructed to take his time since they were being paid hourly. He said he had many upset customers. I asked what if someone didn't have the money to pay the higher amount. He said they  had to keep the belongings on the truck and notify the police. SAVE YOURSELF FROM AN EXPENSIVE NIGHTMARE."

I called the company and was told they would call me back within two hours, but that was not true.  I called back a week later and they said they would call me back within 30 days.  I was waiting for a refund for the $300 that I was paying them to fix the problem.  The next day they called me and said they were going to call me back.  I was told they would call me back within a few days and I would call them back within 30 days.  They said they would call me back within 30 days.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"Here is our experience...Things to know before selecting Rogo's.  You need to get very specific information from the salesperson, ours (Richard) told us they would tape all of the baseboards and tape the grout lines before they are painted.  

Also be prepared for a LOT of dust throughout your whole house when they sand - while they cover cabinets and appliances our team actually started pulling the covers off while final sanding was still underway...

Things I have to repair after Rogo's left:
1. EVERY baseboard has to be repainted, they left blue painters tape everywhere and tore off 2 coats of paint so that they look horrible.
2. Wall paint touchups - they got concrete and sealer up to 3 feet high on the walls
3. Water leaks - they reinstalled the washer and dryer but hooked BOTH of them up incorrectly creating a small flood on the new floors
4. grout lines - they did NOT tape the grout lines like promised and some look like a small child painted them with paint going outside of the lines so that they look wobbly when viewed from across the room.
5. Paint spatters - they dropped paint in numerous areas and just scraped it off exposing the concrete below (some of these were repaired afterwards but several remain).

They did send a repairman out to touch up the floors and he did a good job spending about 3-4 hours redoing their work.  He said he could have spent the whole day there...

We were told they pay their sub-contractors before the job which creates an urgency for those teams to hurry up and get to the next job.  

Overall, the floors will look nice once I finish all the repairs listed above but you need to be aware so that this doesn't happen to you."
Home Services,4.5,OR,"My wife and I woke up Saturday to a blisteringly hot house. Our AC wasn't turning on, and we needed it fixed ASAP, seeing as we're in the middle of an awful heat wave. We called a number of HVAC repair services in Philly, but no one else (including some other highly reviewed ones here on Yelp) were able to come out in under a week. In fact, without mentioning names, some of them were outright rude, as if it was such an inconvenience to them to ask them come out and fix our AC.

So I came across Lawrence H&A on Yelp, and they had some stellar reviews, so I gave them a call. Surprisingly, they were able to come out the next day to take a look. They were courteous, were willing to work with my schedule, and even called to let me know they were running a tad late. I definitely appreciated the call.

Anyway, once Glen and his partner got here, it took them about 30 seconds to diagnose the problem. Glen was upfront about the problem and the cost immediately, and was honest about what needed to be done and what didn't. Seeing as our unit hadn't been serviced in years, they did some maintenance and cleaning as well as the repair, and Glen was extremely helpful, giving me tips about how to keep the AC unit maintained and efficient. It turns out our AC unit was installed by some lazy contractor when the house was built (5 years before we moved in), but Glen gave me some ways to optimize air flow through the house and probably save some money on my electric bills.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the work. Convenient, flexible, fast, honest, and fairly priced. Great combo!

I highly recommend these guys, you won't be disappointed."
Home Services,2.5,CG,"This is my second year here. The only reason I've stayed here for 2 years is because the owner is not very nice. The office staff is awful and the apartments are very large.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"Super disappointed in my experience. I scheduled an appointment to tour the complex for today at 11:30am. I arrived 5 minutes early and could not get in as there was no one at the front desk. Finally someone left & I was able to get in. I emailed my contact to let them know I was downstairs and that there was no one at the front desk. 

10 minutes went by and I received no reply, so I sent an additional message saying that I could only wait another 5-10 minutes because I took personal time from work to do the tour and I had a meeting I needed to be back for. at 11:50 (20 minutes after my appointment time) the woman I had been in contact with walked through the front door with other perspective tenants. When I mentioned I had an appointment she replied by saying ""she had a walk-in come in"". 

She then proceeded to ask me what time my appointment was for and what time it was currently. A clearly awkward encounter for both me and the other prospective tenant. She then said ""ok hold on"" and told the other people to follow her. I assumed she would be back within 5 minutes. 

I waited 10 minutes and chatted with a current tenant who told me that the building has gone down hill. After being informed there was no longer security at the desk all day, that there is no real system for making sure packages get picked up, and that they also allow hotels to use their rooms and there are cleaning crews daily making noise, I decided it was not worth my time to wait any longer. 

A huge disappointment in what looks like, from the pictures since I never got the tour, a beautiful building."

Home Services,2.5,OR,"I hired Bay to Bay from a referral from someone who owns apartments and other properties.  She said Bay to Bay is great.  Well, paid for a new roof at the end of June.  They installed.  I said I just purchased property 3 months ago.  No leaks whatsoever.  I just know it is an older roof and I want to make sure a new roof will last for another 20-30 years so I do not have any problems being a widow.  They put the new roof on. I have had leaks since.  Now, in 3 areas.  I am losing my mind.  They won't return my calls.  They just ignore me!  OMG.  I can't believe a company like this exists!!!  They claim to be a good company and put a new roof on and send idiots that tell you pretty much it's your problem?  I can't handle the mental anguish.  I just told my son he needs to handle it.  He just went up in the attic to take pictures of all of the leaks.  I hope they fix it.  Don't go with this company.  They have inadequate staff. They pay a crew of roofers (who look like they have green cards). Then, if you have leaks, they ignore it and hope it will go away.  What kind of business is this?  If the staff does not fix, I am going to the owner.  But, it sounds to me by the other comments that the owner doesn't care much either.  I am going to contact the referral if this doesn't get fixed.  I am sure she will not use them either.  I am just appalled and feel so helpless."

Home Services,4.0,OR,"tl;dr I can't say enough good things about this company, full stop. 

I've been having MASSIVE issues with my HVAC system, like whoa. I've had several of their people out to my house to get me sorted, including twice when they came out simply to tweak stuff that I didn't know how to do. Every person they sent has been friendly and respectful and before each visit I was sent a text with the name and picture of the person I'd be working with. 

They've only charged me for the actual work they did and their pricing was comparable to what I found elsewhere. There were several things they recommended but they let me know which were important and which were optional/could wait - I didn't get a hard sell on literally anything, even the work that definitely needed doing. As a single mom with 3 kids it's a big deal to know my money was well-spent and that I can trust the work. 

They took me through every issue they diagnosed, in detail. Offering to take me on to the roof to see/verify what they found, taking videos/pics to show me, drawing diagrams, explaining it all in layman's terms so I could understand their recommendations - at no point did I walk away feeling like I was having to just take their word for it. Also, as a woman, I want to point out that they spoke to me exactly like my male friend - I never felt like I was being talked down to in any way. 

They really went the extra mile for me, squeezing me in to their schedule and following up with me after every step (this took 3 separate appointments *not* including the diagnostic). 

Definitely give these guys a call, I won't be going anywhere else for HVAC work."

Home Services,5.0,OR,"I got rolled up on today by CHP for my tinted windows. I live in truckee, the cops out here are super bored. They got me for my front windshield tint. I was literally ""PARKED"" and they pulled up.. so shady! Anyway I was bummed I got the fix it ticket. Gave my tint guy a call to see if I can get it removed but unfortunately his business was no longer open. Bummer again! So I searched up for a tint shop in Reno bc Truckee don't do tints (gay) and I found Northern Nevada. I called and got an answer right away. I spoke to Taylor explaining what happened, he was very polite and professional on the phone, luckily he had an opening for me to come in later that afternoon. At this point I feeling less bummed. Drove to Reno easy to find the shop. Very nice shop. Pulled my car in so they can start the work and I waited in the waiting room, very clean & nice waiting area... nice leather couch, free WiFi, Keurig coffee & tea and Netflix on the big screen. I felt comfortable while getting my car worked on. Finally got to meet Taylor and he was very knowledgeable about the tint game. His products look grade A and prices are good. When it comes to tint, go for quality. It will save you in the long run. Good tint will not only make your car look fresh but also protect your skin from the Sierra UV rays. Stay away from those wrinkles ladies!!!! 
Taylor did an amazing fast job on the removal and gave me positive advice for my future tinting. I will be returning to Taylor to get work done! Thanks Taylor for making my bummed day to a Stoke day! You're solid! God bless..."

Home Services,4.0,OR,"Maria and her crew did such a crappy job with cleaning our house. It was a 5 bedroom house and she charged me 300$ for deep cleaning for 2 hours. She said she has 4 people to do it. She also insisted on me paying cash instead of check. The bathroom mirrors were clean as well as the oven top. The kitchen and bathroom floors were not as clean as I expected. The carpet under the beds were not vacuumed. Study tables were left dusty. Our patio was not cleaned and I had to call her attention so she sent her staff the day after. When I texted her, her reason was that our house needed a lot of cleaning. Well that's the reason they were hired. The windows were also not cleaned. She gave back 80$ as she recognized they did not do a good job. She blamed it on one of her staff who she apparently fired. But she was there to oversee the job so she does not have an excuse. Really crappy job. This was my first time to hire someone to clean our house and I was so sorry I chose the wrong people.

I'm not expecting miracles. I know the house needed cleaning. It's not beyond one would expect in a house with 3 children. There is a reason why you were hired. I didn't expect you to paint the walls or do the carpet cleaning. But the very basic job of vacuuming under the bed and dusting a study table was missed, or should I say intentionally not done? Integrity is being honest and doing the right thing even when no one is looking. You obviously do not have that. If you hire these people, make sure you watch them really close. Or please just don't hire them. Hire someone else."

Home Services,2.0,OR,"I wish I could give more stars, but I can't. There are plenty of great things about this place: the location, the parking, and the management. I can walk to class and always find a place to park. The management always answers questions quickly and is super friendly! They even let me pay January rent a bit late since I didn't have my financial aid. The things I would complain about are the residents, the cleanliness, and the storage. There isn't much space to put any of your things. There isn't a pantry and you kind of have to pick and choose what you want in your kitchen because of such small space. There aren't any drawers in the bathrooms which isn't terrible, but it's definitely hard to keep things organized. 

The residents are really why I have 3 stars. It's so loud and the residents never clean up after themselves. There are constantly holes in the walls and management fixes them, but the next day they're there again. People leave their dog poop in the hallway. Same with beer cans and other trash. Doesn't matter what day it is, residents are always so freaking loud. They scream, yell, run up and down the hallways making it hard to study or sleep. If you are the party type I would suggest living here. However, if you're a junior or senior who wants to take school seriously, don't. It's impossible to get peace and quiet. 

Like I said, management is fantastic and I have NEVER had a problem with them. I just would highly suggest they screen their residents a bit more. I think the Vista has so much potential if they could steer away from the crazy party animals who don't have any sense of picking up after themselves and can't seem to be quiet at decent hours."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"DO NOT LIVE HERE. Moving into these apartments has been the biggest mistake of my life. AFTER I moved in they sent out mass letters saying they will begin towing cars. These apartments are an extremely high price to begin with; when you come to management with concerns their only response is ""you can purchase a garage and park there or you will have to park else where in the complex and walk to your apartment."" I am a young girl who gets home late at night. I do not want to be walking around alone at night from one side of the complex to the other. Towing begins on July 1st yet I received a phone call at 9 am saying if I park on the curb again in 2 weeks then my car will get towed and again told to purchase a garage. 
Also moving in I received a letter on June 12 saying I owed them 28 dollars and if it was not paid by the 14th then I would be charged a $125 late fee. I did not owe them any money  and when questioned why I received it they had no answer for what the 28 dollars was for. 
Yes it is a nice apartment, close to highways and nice gym and pool but it is not even close to being worth it for the way the management of this complex.
The gates also keep going down so my gate key does not always work, or when visitors or deliveries are coming and it calls my phone it does not work so I have to drive to the front and let them in the complex. 
 I have only lived here for 2 weeks, I can only imagine the headaches to come I will receive living here till the end of my lease."

If you pay $200 to install a new heater, the rebate is based on the number of units you install. If you pay $300 to install a new heater, the rebate is based on the number of units you install.

The installation of the new water heater is very simple, and I have never heard of anyone else doing this. I have had two of my roommates install the new water heater in the same room and the first one had a leak in the boiler. I have spoken with the manager of the property, who told me that I would be charged a $50 installation fee for having my heater installed. I have never had a problem with this company. I will be calling the insurance company and this is a scam. I have been using the company for my water heater for the past year. I will not be using them again."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"This company has TERRIBLE customer service.  We have a contract with American Water Resources, had a septic problem that happened 5 days ago, have been trying to get something done since then. We call the service line every day, get a recording telling us to hold and someone will take the call and we WAIT FOREVER. No one ever picks up.  I searched the internet for additional numbers to try to reach them, and was able to finally leave my number for someone to call back. When that person called me and I relayed the problem, the information was put into their system but I was told a claim number could not be generated, that there was some error. I was assured that I would get a call back within 2 hours with a claim number and that a service company would be able to set up an appointment then to come out to make repairs. Did I get a call back? Of course NOT. So I called the company again, surprisingly got a real person to answer, but was told we would have to start all over. I was put on hold and forced to wait some more. As I write this, I am still on hold... supposedly a supervisor is going to come on the line to help.  This is not rocket science - it is taking info and recording it and setting up an appointment to get repair service! So far, I would give American Water Resources ZERO STARS!  I will be more than happy to change that if we ever get any actual repair service... Now the person has come back on the line to tell me they have no service providers in our area!!!! So why do they charge for a contract with them if they cannot provide any service????"

Home Services,1.5,OR,"This place is a total rip off. Seriously. My daughter and husband lived here and let me tell you. They put in numerous calls to maintenance and the office about a running toilet, TWO weeks later someone comes out. Only for them to receive a really high water bill. If you move in towards the latter part of the month, YOU WILL GET CHARGED for a whole month of cable even though they say at first you only have to pay for the week. Parking is atrocious. Don't think you are going to be able to have birthday parties or family get togethers because there is no parking. There are only 3 visitor parking spots to a building and people staying with tenants take those up. If you are caught parking in the tenants parking area, YOU WILL GET TOWED. Many nights my kids come home with two babies and they have to park 5 buildings away to find a parking spot, ITS RIDICULOUS. Absolutely NO DOG SIZE RESTRICTION so while you are outside, you will encounter huge dogs so beware. Tenants are too lazy to pick up their dog crap. Tenants also don't watch their kids and management does nothing about it. They throw crap at your vehicles, tear signs out of the ground and scream and holler to no end. No supervision because the parents are too lazy to do anything. I am a very leary of the accounting abilities of the office as you will get charged extra which goes against the lease. The only thing I can say is that these apartments are cute inside and so spacious but that is it. Everything else sucks. Save your money and the headache and go some place else.

I went to lumber liquidators to get help picking out flooring for my hair salon. I explained that I needed flooring that was durable for a salon with the foot traffic and that wouldn't be stained with hair color being used. He helped me pick out laminate flooring because it is wouldn't stain and is great for commercial use. Great, right? 
Well after the first day of having the floors installed there were stains all over the floor. The second the hair color hits the floor it immediately stains and drinks up the color. Even if it's immediately cleaned the stain sets right in. You can imagine how frustrating this is as the brand new light colored laminate floor. 
I went right to lumber liquidators where I purchased the floor and talked to the manager. She said how odd the staining is because that's the type of flooring they recommended to salons because of how durable it is and that they have a lot of salon customers but that I should call their customer service number. So this is now two people that work at the store told me that this was the right floor for my use. 
When I call customer service I talk to rude and dismissive. She offered to give me replacement boxes for the flooring ( the flooring that I paid a professional $1900 to have installed!) and that there is a way to can pry apart boards To replace them one by one. I called the contractor who installed the floors who said this is insane and that it would be near impossible and destroy the floor doing so. 

They have done absolutely nothing to rectify this situation and now I am left with a floor that looks horrible after spending $3,900 on an upgrade for my small business."

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I lived on Hartford st. in tower grove east for a year, and the entire experience was a nightmare. I was supposed to move in at the end of February, but when I got my things moved in and actually tried to spend my first night there, I realized it was freezing even though I had turned on the heat. I couldn't sleep there that night so I went to my partner's place. 

I had the gas company come out to check on it the next day: the man told me the gas had been turned off due to some dangerous appliance installation and if he were to turn on the gas then and there it would have probably killed me in my sleep. I was horrified and told Frontier that my lease was now void and I would walk away now if they didn't fix it.

I couldn't actually live there until the second week in March because of this.

I also had a problem with my power the first week, and noticed that the breakers in the the basement were not labeled at all, so I accidentally turned off my upstairs neighbors' power as well... When I walked upstairs to mention it to them, my new neighbor accosted me and screamed and cursed at me. I was terrified. It was a simple fix, the power company came out and fixed it about an hour later, but I was shaking in my new apartment because I was afraid for my physical safety.

BONUS: You gave us good suggestions at the base/root to improve health (much more than the arborist from Agri Turf who also had his owners here who were a ZERO on this & wasted my time & money).  You worked diligently and with a great understanding of the tree, why to cut certain places.  You communicated this to me with confidence and quickly with respect to my busy time. 
Setting up the work: 
1st call - no call back, but i always give benefit of doubt
2nd call - He responded immediately  (he was super attentive on second call and this having to call often seems not unusual for SBA...so many times i have to chase contractors in this town so two calls is actually good track record)
3rd - we arranged for him to pass by within a week to 10 days to see the tree. He was on time, looked at tree, shared thoughts efficiently and explained his rate (hourly vs day) and how long he expected it to take. 
4th- we were told it would be two weeks but if an opening came up sooner, he would advise and he did ...he was back within days.  thank you!
5th- work was done expertly and efficiently
6th- billing was on point and fair.  No hidden charges.  He managed his time well 
7th - a light isn't working on tree and he is coming back to address it.  

Highly recommend him. He does work at Lotus land too.  A real winner!  You will be lucky if you can schedule him especially if you want thoughtful cuts and to be a good steward of your trees and property.  He understands the long term vision and consequences of his cuts."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"Jared and his team at JG Real Estate took over property management in April, so I can only reflect on the last two months of the transition. Working with them has been nothing short of smooth, professional, and efficient. I was looking specifically for a company to be proactive and have attention to detail that my tenants need and expect. JGRE delivers on all fronts - communication, process, leasing, billing, and more. I was impressed with their property inspections, reports, and followthrough; they were thorough, giving me a baseline to work off of. They have a full team in place, so i can get answers about my account and responses to issues or emergencies quickly. So far, my tenants have been happy with the transition - that's a big deal.

JGRE's property management is robust..  they took over a large commercial building, mixed-use space, and a smaller condominium unit; each with its set of challenges and particular arrangements. JGRE integrated the fine details into their system, setup electronic payments for tenants, and automated the accounting process. It's been smooth sailing since the initial setup.

At the start, I had a vacancy in one of my buildings for months, which the previous property management company did not fill, and this frustrated me. Within one week of hiring JGRE, they found a tenant giving me full occupancy, and resolved a few pending maintenance issues. Couldn't be happier.

Jared's team has gone above and beyond. One of my buildings needed minor construction upgrades for a laundry room and front steps repaired. JGRE worked with me to create a spec sheet, bid the work out, found a qualified contractor, and managed communication with the tenants on disruption times, work days, and project scope and completion.

JGRE does their work with competency which takes a load off my back. Most importantly, my tenants are happy which is the name of the game."

Home Services,1.5,OR,"My problem with Monon Place is purely financial. This year they switched the utilities so that you have to pay Monon, who then pays the utility company. This was all so that they could charge you a $100 late fee if you paid a day late. Utility companies typically only charge a very small late fee and let it go. Monon, however, writes in a tiny font on their newsletters about big changes such as this, and then when you get the late fee, say in a frightening letter you will be evicted within 5 days if you do not pay immediately. 
So there's that.
My lease is almost up and for months I have gotten newsletters that say big and boldly at the top: ""Want to Renew Your Lease? Tell us by this day"" etc. However, also in small letters on these is the fact that regardless of when your lease ends, they will only let you out of the lease 60 days after you sign a paper saying you're not coming back. 
Makes no sense.
My lease ends July 4th, so I thought I would only be paying for June's rent and a couple days. However, now I will be paying for June AND July's entire month because I did not see their tiny font saying that regardless of lease dates, you will be paying. 
They even made the mistake of saying in this newsletter, ""We want to ensure you are stuck paying for something if you're planning to move out.""

They meant to say NOT stuck paying for something, but I think it was a true Freudian slip because this apartment complex absolutely loves to get people's money with tiny details and mistakes such as this. Please do not move here. It is the worst apartment I've ever lived in and I want people to know not to move here, regardless of the great location."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Five Stars!! Very impressed with David and his team at Five Star Flooring. We were originally going to buy the flooring from Floor & Decor and have Five Star just handle the installation. When we went to purchase the flooring, they said it was on backorder and did not know when it would be in stock. We had a tight window to get it all done so we reached out to David for help. He met us at his showroom and took the time to compare the flooring that we were originally looking at and finding a great substitute. Five Star made the whole experience easy and stress free, which is very important right after the process of buying a house. The team installed the floor in a matter of days and they look great!

What you can expect based on our experience:
-Incredible communication. David would reply to every one of my texts within seconds. -Great craftsmanship. These guys are true professionals and great at what they do. We had some weird angles and transitions and they made it look seamless. -Quick work. We had the whole downstairs of our house done and they were completely finished in a little under 3 days. -Baseboard removal and put back. They will also take care of the caulking afterwards, you will just need to repaint them. -Cleanup. They will haul away any carpet (or whatever that was being taken out) and will not leave a mess, like I saw on another yelp review. You will need to do a little mopping/cleaning before moving in the furniture. David provided us with a Bona wet mop that works great. -Great pricing. For the beauty and ease of using Five Star, the price is right. Trying to take care of this on my own would have been insane. I highly recommend the team at Five Star and appreciate the skill and professionalism of everyone on their team."
Home Services,3.5,OR,"As a new client of Accent Maid Services I was thrilled to hear of a local company that had been in business for 20 plus years.  The owner, Sherry spoke of the consistency of her ""girls"" many of which had worked for her for a long time.  Sherry spoke of the top to bottom thorough cleaning that was routine and that the girls worked in pairs.   

After three attempts, it is quite clear that the owner, Sherry makes empty promises.  Her girls as she calls them are anything but consistent. The first day that they were scheduled to clean, they were  2.5 hours late.  The second time Sherry called to say no one could get their car started and another occasion the ""girls"" were sick.  She says she's been in business a long time.  I'm not sure how because the service is NOT what she sells it to be.  Beware.  She is in sales and talks a great sales pitch but does not produce.  She promised simple things like baseboards were cleaned as a standard part of house cleaning.  It was NEVER done. She stated that if I left a hardwood floor polish; the floors would be polished.  The  hard wood floors were left dull and clearly not even cleaned let alone polished. The mirrors were streaky and the shower door was cleaned but only 2/3 of the way up.  This is basic stuff done carelessly.  I'm not sure if Sherry really knows how her employees perform because she is in the office answering the phone. 

BEWARE of Accent Maid Service. They will take your money but do little service. Not at all what the owner describes.  I have employed various individuals and companies for house cleaning over the last 20 years, I have never been so disappointed."

Since I live out of town now, I couldn't reschedule.

We called today for service on another unit. They said it would be $1200 to repair an ignition board and a motor. I asked them for a quote on a replacement unit as the unit is about 27 years old and not worth putting $1200 into it. Randy, their ""Comfort Specialist"" (aka salesman), calls with a quote which I say is about $1000 higher than the unit I replaced one and a half years ago. I question him on it and when I tell him to send me the quote so I can compare it with competitive quotes he becomes a donkey's posterior region immediately.

We hang up and he calls back a few minutes later to correct me that it is only about a $700 difference than what I paid previously. Again what a donkey's posterior region that he has to call me back to ""prove me wrong"". The only thing he proved is he is a donkey's posterior region and I'll never do business with D&H again.

After giving D&H 3 new AC sales in about 10-12 years, you'd expect they would treat long term customers better."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"When I turned on my heat for the new season, I had no flame. Despite having used a smaller company recently for another job, I called Horizon in hopes a bigger company could get out sooner. Based on their ""we care about you and your family, blah, blah"" advertising, I thought I could count on their fairness, too.

The tech who came out told me it could be my primary and/or my control board, and that he would have to replace BOTH just to continue to troubleshoot (e.g., there could be even more issues). I was quoted $2,200 just to do that much, and again warned there could be more. At that point, I was told I should just explore replacing the ENTIRE unit (it is just 10 years old). A day later, I have someone quoting my $7,000 (after the usual, 'let me see what discounts my manager can do,' 'you know, you can finance it,' 'if you agree to have it installed tomorrow' runaround sales crap).

Thankfully, after the tech's suspiciously expensive, and vague, diagnosis, I called that smaller company and they were going to be coming out soon. So, I sent the sales rep on his way and said I'd call at another time to schedule the repair....yeah, I never planned to do that.

The other company's tech came out and also agreed it could be the primary control. In fact, he felt quite assured it was. FYI, I had since discovered this part costs $60 or so. Moreover, this tech said he was just going to switch in the new part ON THE SPOT and see if that was the problem. If it wasn't, he would just put the old one back in. THAT is how easy changing a primary control is (does not alter the new part), apparently. 45 minutes later, the new part was in AND I HAD HEAT AGAIN.

Never again, Horizon. NEVER. AGAIN."

He said that they would be refunding me $109 from the $617 that I was charged. I thought well something is better than nothing, not as much as I wanted but what can I do. I had to call twice after this initial phone call before I received any kind of refund. Checking my bank account for that refund amount of $109 , all I was refunded was $100.

Home Services,5.0,OR,"If you are thinking of buying or selling real estate, we strongly recommend working with Scott Williams. Scott helped us purchase an investment property in May, 2012 and we have recently worked with Scott on a simultaneous sale and purchase  transaction.  Before meeting Scott, we had little real estate experience and zero real estate investment experience.  Foremost, Scott is a good listener.  He took time to get to know us and to help us clearly define the type of property that fit our circumstances and our future goals.  Scott's knowledge of the Santa Barbara market is deep and broad.  Many years of real estate experience in the Santa Barbara area and a passion for keeping abreast of market trends give Scott a powerful advantage in understanding the market.  Scott likes to share information and takes the necessary time to educate us about the market and how to look at properties.  We can always count on Scott to share interesting information from a recent report, class, or conversation - information that helps us in the process of locating and purchasing a property.  Scott works with our best interests in mind - always taking the long view. He is quick to point out things that might affect the future value of a property.  Scott performs from start to finish and beyond.  During the transactions, Scott always kept us informed and a step ahead of the process which we felt gave us a leg up on the completion.  Even after the sale, when some items were not taken care of as per the contract, Scott followed up with the other party until it was right.  And did I mention the free moving van?  In our opinion, Scott Williams ""has it going on"" big time and he continually exceeds our expectations for a real estate agent.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"By far the worst and most dishonest company out there. Went and looked at a house that we completely fell in love with, we just had to come up with the money for all the deposits and bullshit other charges they nickel and dime you for. I was waiting for my boyfriend to return from his TDY so he could see the inside of the house also, but other than that we wanted it. We told the realtor we wanted it, 100% positive and that we would have the money and be ready to sign a lease by the end of the night. ONE HOUR before our appointment, the realtor TEXTED us and told us he had just shown it and the couple he had shown it to put down the deposit. When we confronted him over the phone about it, he just said ""my apologies, but I've lost money before because of people who were so sure they wanted the house and then didn't put down a deposit, and these people had the deposit in cash in hand."" So at the end of the day this company does NOT care at all about clients, it's about money and who has it the fastest, appointment or not. Needless to say I've told everyone how shitty this company is.

On top of the fact that there are a bunch of hidden charges they do not tell you about until you are completely in love with the house. Non refundable pet deposit, only partially refunded security deposits (not refunded at all if you decide you don't want the house), and an extra charge because they have to deposit your checks in the bank. Also a $50 background check per adult that's going to be living in the house, and they won't rent to you if you have any felonies AND it's not refunded to you.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"Would've given zero stars if the option were available.

I have a maintenance contract with American Home Shield, otherwise I never would've put up with Greenway. It's been so bad, I'm not going to renew my AHS contract.

How bad? My first washing machine call was on May 10. It's now June 24. I've had four service calls, and the washer is still badly broken. We're making weekly trips to the laundromat because Greenway can't get the washer fixed. Six weeks and counting.

The AC unit is the real kicker. I went to the AHS web site on June 9 and submitted a service request. The web site told me I couldn't submit one at the time. I tried again on June 11, and ended up calling the AHS phone number. No human answered, so I left a message, asking for service. I didn't get a call back, so on June 16 I had an independent company refill the cooler. That was $550+.

The next day, the AC went out again. Early on the morning of June 19 (Father's Day), I submitted another service request on the AHS web site. Finally got a call from Greenway on June 20 - and was told a service person wouldn't be available until June 23. We're camping out in the living room in the interim.

Service person arrived June 23. The coils are frozen. He had me turn off the AC and keep the fan running. Said he'd have Greenway call back and make an appointment, hopefully for June  25, but by June 27 ""at the latest."" 

Greenway didn't call me, so today, June 24, I called them. Soonest they can come out is June 29. That's 20 days from when I first started having problems.

Greenway hasn't fixed the problems, in spite of numerous tries and horrendous delays. We're using a laundromat and camping on the living room floor. What do I think about Greenway? Zero stars."

Home Services,3.0,OR,"After moving into a flipped house we knew that we may have some issues. It turned out that our kitchen sink drain line was leaking as well as a major blockage with the main drain line in the house. I could have done the Kitchen Sink drain myself but seeing as we had a drain issue in the bathrooms (and the kitchen drain was an awkward job) we decided to just have Roto Rooter do the jobs. 

Our plumber Dwayne came to our home on a Sunday at 3pm and was there until 9pm to install the new drain and to snake the drain lines for all bathrooms. It turned out that this was not an easy job at all. I've had plumbers for similar issues in previous properties and this was a tough one. 

Dwayne was professional, clean, and paid attention to detail on the job. Heck we liked him so much we gave him dinner while he wrote our bill!!

I know Roto Rooter is not the cheapest in terms of quoted price, however.... And this is a BIG however.... My wife asked for a quote from another big name plumbing service just for the drain in the kitchen. They quoted over double what Roto Rooter quoted and that didn't even include the snaking of the main drain line. When she texted me the quote I was astonished! So I was pleased when Dwayne from Roto Rooter quoted me a competitive price for the jobs needed. 

I know I could have probably paid about $100-150 less than what I paid Roto Rooter if I went with an Independent, but that was not what I was looking for. Competitively priced (competitive, not cheapest), professional, and a Company Name I trust, I was very pleased with the work performed. 

I will ask for Dwayne by name should the need ever arise again. He was a great guy and professional throughout. Very pleased."

The owner, Alex Vidal is the most profesional, courteous and detailed gentleman I have dealt with in a long time. We had our rental house painted by Alex and his crew this past July, 2017. 

The house had been neglected by hoarders and had done considerable damage. Alex worked diligently and delivered what he promised. He power washed the entire house, moved the gravel away from the walls, did two coats (vertical and horizontal) repaired the wooden beams on the patio and made the house look brand new within a matter of two days. Kept on schedule and was punctual with our tenants. 

We live out of state, and we were looking forward to meeting him in person and completing the final inspection. However at the last minute, our elderly German Shepard became seriously ill and we couldn't leave her. Alex worked with our schedule, we were able to get our newly hired property manager to complete the walk through for us, and from our property manager's own words: ""Silvia, that is by far the best paint job I have ever seen in the entire Tucson area and surrounding areas."" In fact,  he asked Alex for his business cards and use him in the near future as part of his property management services. Extra kudos for Wildcat Painting!

Our tenants, also called to let us know the house looked like a brand new house. Extra extra kudos for Wildcat Painting!

Please keep in mind, I normally get 5-6 six different quotes for any contract work, Alex beat the other five competitors and we couldn't be happier with the end result.

Home Services,3.5,OR,"In response to your post I have lots more to say. First the work you did was good, but it was not what we wanted at all. We wanted an entire house inspection for mold which was not done. We had work done that we might not have needed. Mold has to be tested to indicate type. That was not done. We ended up spending too much money and we are now in debt. We still have mold in our basement which according to your contract will not be removed. We also have a problem in our bathroom and we have to spend money for remediation. Your shady salesman came to our house with an agenda which was not our agenda at all.  All we wanted was a whole house inspection. You should not be listed on Thumbtack because you do not conduct an inspection according to our present inspector that is within the parameters of ethical testing. We now have to spend a lot of money that we do not have. If I thought I
could sue your company I would. 

I will tell anyone to hire a ""real' inspector who has no agenda. They work as your advocate and do not even recommend companies who do the remediation. This way you do not have work done that may have not been needed. You cannot tell by looking at the mold. It has to be tested in a lab. 

If you want your basement redone fine, but that is NOT what we wanted. Do not fall for a free estimate, it is just a sales pitch.  I really dislike this company and the people who work there. I would NEVER hire them again and will tell others about our horrible experience.  We owe money for work we might not have needed and now we have to put out more money.

Home Services,4.5,OR,"Our 38 year old water heater had a gas leak and was red tagged by NV Energy. We were without hot water and being December, we were desperate for a quick replacement. I was dreading having to call a plumber however, because last time we had a less urgent plumbing issue no one would call me back or would return calls days later. 

This time, instead of cold calling.. I 
reached out to plumbers via the Yelp quote and also used HomeAdvisor website that ""matched"" me with a plumber. I immediately received responses from three plumbing companies this way. Amazing!

I went with Straight Up! Plumbing because they were able to send a tech out immediately and do the job right then. Kathleen called me early in the AM before they even opened I think and told me she would send someone right away. I loved that, I didn't even have to call! 

I was impressed with Robert, the technician that came out, who seemed very knowledgeable about water heaters and was very honest about the different types of water heaters and pricing. The pricing was provided immediately--flat rate. And considering the quality of the water heater we received--an energy efficient Brighton white--I think it was fair. We didn't pay a penny more than what we were quoted.

Robert completed the rip out of the old heater and install of the new one within 2 hours. It works great and I couldn't be happier with the service I received! 

One thing that really stood out about this company was their communication. They use the House Call App and I received text and email notifications through the whole process regarding when the tech was on his way to my home, the estimate, and a copy of my invoice. All digital and through the app. Love it!!  

I am so happy to have found ""our"" plumber that we will definitely be using for all our plumbing needs!"
Home Services,3.5,OR,"I have to update my review. I've been a member of about 8 months now. It is hands down the best gym in philly. Which is why I guess I continue to go. However being the best compared to terrible gyms doesn't make it amazing. At first I was obsessed. But lately it has been so crowded it's hard to deal with. I used to love working out in the mornings getting ready at the gym then going to work. That's the reason I joined such an expensive gym, was to have a nice locker room. However, if I do that there's no where to get ready. I wait to find a spot to put on makeup and try to blow dry my hair. It's way too crowded for only about 10 stations to get ready at. Also the classes are super crowded. If you don't book it right away you can't get into any of the good ones. It's been so frustrating. 

And on top of it they change their perks without explaining. When I joined a perk was free PSN sports teams. It's one of the reasons I was ok with the price. I join and email about how it works and I'm told ""they no longer do that"" without any explanation. I emailed back to ask why and when this occurred because it's one of the reasons I joined and no one has responded to me ever. It's been over a month. 

It's the best of what's around but I don't think it's worth the cost. To top off all of my issues I just received a letter they're raising the monthly fee. It's only by a few dollars but it's the principal. So frustrated but unfortunately in philly there's no where else to go. So that's why it's so popular. The best of what's around by far as far as facilities, etc. but they make it hard to enjoy sometimes."

Rick contacted my realtor directly to schedule for the radon person to arrive a few days before the inspection, so that the radon kit could be picked up at inspection. Flynn came out to do the inspection - on time and ready to go to work. My husband followed Flynn around during much of the inspection and he was very good at providing feedback both positive and negative about what he saw. Flynn let us know immediately that he thought the roof was at the end of it's life and that the fireplaces had problems. He also provided us on the spot with a list of contractors including roofers that Real Estate Inspections recommends. His on the spot feedback allowed us to quickly call a couple of roofers and a fireplace company to come out for second tier inspections and bids - which allowed us to make an informed response to the seller all within our tight inspection time frame. Flynn then provided us with a complete detailed written report within 48 hours. He was very responsive, when I called him two times after receiving the report with questions. Flynn is very knowledgable and great about sharing information not only about defects but how to best care for your house moving forward. During this process, we also had the opportunity to meet Pete, one of the owners who made sure that all our needs were being met. We were pleased to have his assistance."
Home Services,1.0,CG,"I would give a negative star if I could.  I will not recommend them to anyone.  They are not the best.  I have used the Taurus twice and it has been GREAT.   It was a long weekend and I was going to use it again.  I had a 2 day break and the Taurus was the last one to arrive.  I called and he was very friendly and pleasant.  He explained everything and I was happy to have him back.  He is very communicative and quick.  I will definitely use them again.I had a great experience with this company. I called at 3:30 and they were here within a few minutes. I had a problem with a leak in my sink and I called them to let them know what was going on and they were able to fix it within an hour.

We were looking for a house that had a very nice appearance.  We had the best experience we could get with them.  The job was completed in a timely manner.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"Apartment complexes are typically rated pretty poorly on Yelp, but TGM Bay Isle deserves it. If I could stand on the roof of their leasing office with a megaphone and tell people to stay away, I would. Let's just start listing and see how far we get.

* The online payment portal was awful and lacked basic functionality before. TGM Bay Isle offers no online payment portal. You have to pay with one check or, if you have a roommate or SO that lives with you, two money orders. That's right. Good old fashioned Western Union $500 limit money orders. Oh, you can pay with cashiers checks too. How convenient.

* The office staff is helpful if you want to sign up for an apartment. After all, it makes them money if they sell a space, so it makes sense. People who say, ""I've had no issues since I recently moved in,"" are delusional. Of course they're nice when you move in because they want your money. They will lay out the red carpet to get you in and trap you for a year. After that, they will never pick up the phone and putting service requests in is a nightmare. 

* Rent went up $100. For what, I have no idea. Probably to subsidize the new amenities they installed. 

* Not remotely close to anything interesting. Unless it's highway access you're after, it's just another exorbitantly expensive place.

* Speaking of the highway, they're jammed right up to I-275. You WILL hear the cars rushing by.

* Speaking of noise, the airplanes fly over day and night. At our new place, you still hear the planes but it's not nearly as loud. Expect to wake up at least a couple times a night if you're a light sleeper.

Special note: Maintenance was told twice about a water leak. They didn't come until the woman below us put in an emergency request because water was seeping through her walls. Poor woman."

Home Services,4.0,OR,"I usually visit Santa Barbara a couple of times a year. Since my first stay here in 2017, it's become the go-to. 

It's family owned and operated, Greg and Jennifer are always around on the property. They're very kind and started to remember my husband and me after we started to make regular visits. The property is very well maintained, comfortable, and has free parking and all the amenities we could need. They'd refurbished it shortly before I first visited and almost every time I've been back they've made some improvement like a new water heater or new sheets. I've never had a single issue staying here. The location is great, too - it's only a block from the beach and a mile or so from State Street.

They're on a few hotel websites but I prefer to book on their website. They're quick to confirm bookings and send information, and they also follow up on the day you're checking in to make sure they'll be there to greet you. 

Since COVID, they've been following guidance on shelter in place and been closed when it's mandated. I've visited twice in the past year (when shelter in place was not in effect) and they've done everything they can to make everything safe. It's kind of bare bones but all in the name of following guidelines. The owners wear masks on the property, they're only in rooms to clean them, and it's quiet. Although they can't serve breakfast, the heated pool is open, and there's coffee in the bedrooms along with the offer of freshly brewed coffee downstairs in the morning. 

Greg also mentioned to us that they'd recently upgraded the bedding, and it was indeed even more comfortable than our last visit. 

It's a wonderful place to stay and venture out from. It's a shame to see it so quiet here but they're doing a great job and I'm looking forward to seeing the place full of life again."

Home Services,4.0,OR,"One of the challenges of owning a dog rescued from a severe abuse case (trust me, owners were charged criminally, which rarely happens, even more rarely in rural Tennessee where it happened), is that you have a lovely, sweet, happy girl who can be terrified of other dogs, certain people, crowds, roaring buses or trucks, and it takes her a while to get used to a 'new' walking route.  She is absolutely worth it.

Her needs, though, make going to a 'regular' vet very traumatic.  Tons of noises. Tons of smells.  Animals who are sick and in pain.  Everybody going to the bathroom in the grass out front.  Strange people, lots of them.  In other words, not something she can handle. At all.

Enter Dr. Pickard and All Pets Housecalls.  Cue angelic music. Because he was great, really. Suzie is generally cautious of men, because the people who abused her were men, however she liked Dr. P immediately. As in 30 seconds and she was giving kisses and full tail wags.  Not only that, she let him listen to her heart and lungs (good). She was only not interested in letting him look at her rear, and I think that's because she hates having her temperature taken (who wouldn't?).   He finally got a look and he didn't take her temperature either.  He said he could tell when a dog was not feeling well and it was needed and she was definitely feeling fine.

Two shots, normal vaccines, pets while he's giving her them.  

I was worried that the cost would be higher than standard vet care because, well, it's a home visit.  I was pleasantly surprised to be sub-$300, which around here is the standard rate for a wellness visit.  Yay!  Happy girl, happy owner.  Dr. Pickard will definitely be our vet for our girl for what we hope is a long, happy dog life."

Home Services,1.0,OR,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY: FIRST UNITED is nothing but a scam broker that takes your money. They refer to it as a deposit! It's not, you see none of the upfront so called deposit back). After you pay them, they simply find you a carrier and there done.Carriers are scam artists as well, not even joking they are out of service, license revoked, and not able to move belongings out of state, not one carrier but TWO. They pick up your belongings, the original estimated costs doubles and triples from what First United reeled you in with (usually a low, to good to be true offer). Customer service is a joke, they take your money and that's it. Anyone that is having issues with this company or their scam carrier, do your research and look up the company's DOT# with the FMCSA website while you're on there and file a complaint. It literally makes me ILL that this company and the Carriers they subcontract out, could put a family through such a disaster of a long distance move. Our belongings were picked up the end of May and here we are in July and still no stuff, with a carrier that is revoked (out of service) and no longer able to deliver out of state and First United as well as both carriers refuse to tell us where our belongings are even being stored, but continue to demand money. Furthermore, the carriers did not provide an inventory, or shipping papers. So please no matter what your circumstances are, avoid this company, avoid perfect movers and storage, avoid American Movers (both out of service/revoked). Do your research and choose a company that actually gets the job done and less of a hassle for the same price. EVERYONE needs to file reports to Florida Dept Of Agriculture, FMCSA, Attorney General of Florida and the Police. I'm so sorry to the innocent people that have had to deal with these scammers."

We've had to turn off the air conditioning and other things we had to replace, including the refrigerator, and the thermostat has been causing a huge leak. The outside of our house is very dirty and our air conditioning has been going out for 2 months now. I've also had the house painted on by a company called Plumbers for my apartment. They have a lot of problems. The techs at the office are rude and do not care about their customers. The house looks brand new and they charge a lot more than other companies. The maintenance team is horrible. They never call me back. I have to get a new house repaired as they are the worst. I've had to call the office to ask for a new air conditioner and they never give me a call back. I have to schedule an appointment for another company to come out to fix my house. I've been extremely unhappy with the company for a long time and would never recommend them.

I recently moved into a new home and the management company was very rude and very unprofessional. They told me that they would not be coming to my home until my new house was finished and then told me that my new house would be finished within a week. I asked for their time to arrive and they said they would not be coming to my house until my new house was finished and then told me that they would be coming to my house within a week and then told me that I could cancel my lease if I wanted to.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"I had a contract with America Home Shield and they contract greenway home service for repairs. I put in a service call for our air conditioning unit back in May 2020.

No one called us I call them after a couple days and they send someone else out who said they would give us options, the tech came and he just told us the history of what they already done and that we can replace the unit or repair I told him we didn't want it replaced and how much would repair be. He didn't have any prices and told me again someone else would call with prices. It's a week later and we still don't have anything to tell us how much the repair would be. I called several times and talked to a manger and she told me someone would call me again, still nothing.

Home Services,2.0,OR,"PREMIUM PRICE AND SUBSTANDARD WORK and the 100% satisfaction guarantee is worthless as I had the work done several years ago and never came close to being satisfied. '
what they did for was redo the house with CPVC and put in  a solar hot water system  First problem they did not glue a pipe all the way a round so leaked  and i did not find out for several days while the water slowly flooded closet and went out into my bedroom carpet on the side I never use so flooded under my king size hard size water bed so now my new carpet i put in a few months before look more worm out the the same carpet I put in my living room 5 years ago.

Second thing they took out the plumping to my ice maker and never hooked it 
they did fix this but quite substandard as the 1/2 inch cpvc pipe stick out from the wall 6 inch before going down into the ground which both very  fragile and possibility a freeze risk.

third thing they did was put a shut off value in my yard which i be very careful about but hit it with the mower yesterday so water is out what piss me off is the installer told me that was were code wanted it but that was a lie as they could of put the shut off value in a safe place on the wall but they took a substandard shortcut.

fourth thing the solar install ran water fall over the edge of my roof  by installing a defective valve and not testing it but they did fix that 

fifth  thing still not resolved they never burred the pipe going to my side bedroom instead they just put it  on top of the dirt but did not know this till i took the plants of the side of my house as i put a new concrete walk in"

Second, We experienced a horrible experience in out apartment... water falling from our ceiling. We called maintenance about the leak when it first started.. He said it will be okay and wait til tomorrow and they will come to fix it... ehh well we woke up at 4am and the whole hall way was pouring and in our living room side =( ... It was not pretty and I was very upset... We called many times about this leak and then finally they came around 8am.. They said we can stay at another apartment for 5 days until they finished fixing our studio. When they said we could come back everything was a mess and paint dust everywhere and on our sofa. They said everything was going to be cleaned and that was not done..
Third, We decided to move to a 1bd apt and wanted to move on the 30th before my family came so they can stay for the night and have more space. They would not let us move on the 30th.. only on May 1st ..which is only one day and  they have been holding the room for us since April 21st!  they said if we move in on the 30th they will charge us double rent for our studio and the new apt...not only that ...we have to pay $500 fee for transfer fee. After all the crap we been through here...This place is so hungry for money...They really don't care about the residents here in the building.. We never complained about the leak or the mess...we cleaned it ourselves.. and moved on but this is so ridiculous...They are rude... I cant wait til our lease is over..."
Home Services,3.0,OR,"I must say, the guys that came or were very nice and accommodating. It worked out that I was planning on getting a quote for a tree removal, but when they showed up they thought it was for the removal, so they gave me a great price and went ahead and did it that day. What i wasn't happy about was that they drove and parked their trailer in my yard, which we have so carefully tried to get grass to grow in. I told them they could park in the driveway next to ours as the house wasn't occupied, which I thought they did, but when I came back out again it was in the yard. I figured that it was my fault because I didn't request them to stay off the grass so I let it go. They came back the next day to finish picking up the limbs and I requested a quote on getting some limbs cut from another tree for thinning while they were there. They promptly responded and again said they could do it that day, which was great. I asked if they would be careful with the grass because it was on a different side of the house and I didn't figure they would need to be in the grass anyway. I got home and they were working hard, but there were tire rugs all through my yard (we have a corner lot so there is no possible reason why they would need to drive where they did). Their truck was on the street at that point so the damage was already done and there was nothing I could say. Apparently, they ran over 3 street signs while they were there too (my neighbor was present when it happened). 

Long story short, they got my taken care of very promptly, the price was reasonable, and they were polite, but I would set expectations at the beginning of what you want regarding boundaries of your yard."

I moved into my ""brand new"" apartment to a couple glaring errors, first off we didn't have a fridge, like seriously just an empty place in our apartment for a fridge, there was mold growing in my bathroom, my closet was assembled by a 3rd grader I think, the shelves weren't screwed in so when I placed a box on them it collapsed, I have submitted 3 service requests while living here for 3 months, none of which have been taken care of, in fact only on one occasion has someone from maintenance even shown up and then he said ""I need to run and grab a new tool"" and never came back and closed the case. We had to resign our lease 6 times! I wish that was an exaggeration but seriously they messed up our lease 5 times so we kept having to go resign it! If the issues I had experienced were because of the pandemic I would not be writing this review but this is cheap and lazily made apartment all around. I pay a premium to live in an apartment where the cabinets dont even close fully! Seriously one is too big on all of them so one cabinet door is always slightly open! Just for the cherry on top half of our outlets don't work, again a service request that hasn't been filled.And on top of that there is parking for maybe 75% of the people that live here, so good luck fighting for a spot and if you can't find one then good luck searching around the area and praying your car isn't broken into. Maybe it's just been a bad experience for me but if I were looking for a place to live I would stay far far far away from LC Germantown."

I was soon to book a different hotel and pay $250 for a 2 night stay when I decided to look further into better deals. 

I came across Studio 6 that made me think somehow motel 6 were some kind of sister company. I didn't get to confirm but given on the similarity of their logos/sign, I believe so. Regardless, I called and spoke w/ Joanne on the phone. She was extremely helpful and provided me with the pricing, accommodation etc. 

They don't require a deposit to hold a room and also don't charge a cancellation penalty fee. However, you can choose to provide your card info prior to your stay to ensure a booked room. 

For 2 nights I paid $112 (tax included) which equals $52 (or so) a night. I feared that I would stay in a roach-filled, unsafe location for trying to save money. Upon check - in , I received the same kind service. Once I stepped into my deluxe room (2 full size beds - fits 3/4 people) I was happily relieved. It was clean, organized and bigger than your standard room. 

My room included:
-Small kitchen (Fridge, sink, stove, and microwave included) 
-T.V 
-AC (must have - cools perfectly) 
-Tub/shower
-Iron +iron board
-Hangers
-Hand soap 
-Towels

There is no blow-dryer and shampoo/conditioner available. Make sure to bring your own.

Check out is at 12 (noon) on any day and check in before 6 pm. 

On a last note- my room was a non-smoking room but it wreaked of cigarette smell 

P.S- There is free parking available. I read that Wifi is available for $5 a day however I also ready online that it's free. I have unlimited, fast internet so I didn't make use of it but if you stay, make sure to inform the receptionist that they advertise free wifi online. 

Def. recommend staying especially if you're only in AZ for a short time. It's  exactly what you need for a short stay and let's not forget - super affordable!"

Home Services,4.0,OR,"This apartment complex is a great location. The maintenance staff here is honestly the best thing about this place as they are quick to action and resolve most issues relatively fast. I'm saying this o have had multiple issues here and the only time they will upgrade your apartment is if your it's actually broke or if you pay for upgrades. I have had issues with my fridge not working, the dryer having to go through multiple cycles before my clothes are done. The HVAC going out and outside bugs getting in as I feel they don't spray enough. I also want to mention the neighbors vary in age from young to old. As I am in a point in my life where when I get back home from work I like to relax and get caught up for the next day I feel like I am surrounded by people who blast there music. It's either that or the walls are paper thin. This place is also owned by an out of state company that gives little support and decision making to their employees here. THe grill is also only open during summer for some reason when the pool is open. We live in Indiana so it's normal to want to grill in fall and winter as long as it's not snowing like crazy out so this can be an inconvenience. The mailroom also is always overloaded with packages as there is no real system the complex keeps in order to manage the chaos. The hallways in the main complex have flooded multiple occasions and the HVACS in the apartments also have leaked causing water to flow on Wood/carpet.

Take it for what this review is overall it's not bad but for the money I would expect more support and updates to be done on a corporate level not when something is truly broke  

If the Movie ""A Quiet Place"" was a real life event then 80 percent of my neighbors would have been dead."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"I cannot believe what happened with this company. I ordered a home warranty through Choice last January for $2467 for 6 years with a $45. 00 service call fee. Last weekend a pipe was leaking in a third bathroom behind a vanity. We torn out the wall and plugged the pipe to stop the water from seeping through because we had no water in the rest of the house and the incident was over Fathers Day weekend. We filed our first claim through Choice on Saturday  and they sent 3J's plumbing out the following Tuesday. It was by far one of the most bizarre encounters we have ever had with a contractor. The plumber hired to review the job came to our house. and suggested we pay him not only the $45. 00 but, another $250. 00 to have him fix the leak. When he was told ""no, we have a warranty"" he then stated he would do it for $200. 00. He was told ""No"" again. He protested and said ""I'm the cheapest around you wont get anyone to do it cheaper"" He then left, when he was called one hour later to see if he was coming back he said no. Oddly he had called Choice and had told them there had been a ""thief in our house"" putting his own twist on things. We then called Choice and told them what had happened. The representative was appalled when I told her about the catch phrase of thievery and the switch and bait con game by 3'Js employee. I then told her if this was what they were sending out to represent their company I would be cancelling my policy effective immediately. I hope it was worth it to 3 J's, it cost them any future business, my $45. 00 that I lost, along with a contract with a warranty company for $2467. 00 that I bought in good faith. Go but word of mouth people its safer and and less expensive. We got it fixed for $50."
Home Services,4.0,OR,"Relo company hired Spotlight Home Inspection to test our stucco on our home.  They recommended a full teardown of all stucco.  
Well, when we tore down the stucco, two full sides had no damage whatsoever - For example, one reading of ""40"" turned out to be dry and no damage!  This continued around all sides of our home.  The two side with more ""damage"" had minimal damage that could have been repaired with spot remediation very easily!
Spotlight told me that one coat of elastomeric paint had a rating of 34.  When we put on a second coat of paint, the rating dropped to 17.  I called the manufacturer of the paint and got a reply from one of their chemical engineers.  He stayed that they recommend 2 coats of paint for a rating of 32.  Spotlight is telling people COMPLETELY FALSE INFORMATION!  They don't even know what they are talking about!  If you want the actual respond, please let me know and I will share with you!
Then to make matters worse, we tore down all of the stucco and replace it with the complete James Hardie Plank siding system.  Spotlight came back out to inspect that system.  How does a ""stucco specialist"" now  become a ""James Hardie specialist""?
I WILL NEVER USE OR RECOMMEND SPOTLIGHT, BILL DARE OR TYLER TO ANYONE!!!  Very cocky and they don't know what they are talking about!  I feel bad for Tyler as he learned his tricks from hands one days with Bill.

Our realtor had a similar situation with Bill and Spotlight.  He gave a similar ""report"" to one of her clients.  When the client decided to get a second opinion, our realtor contacted Bill and his reply was, "" I thought you wanted me to SCREW the Seller?""

Home Services,2.5,OR,"Looked here for apartments last winter.  I think the online pictures were much nicer than what we saw in person.  Example: The picture of the gym makes it look like a full scale gym, but when you go you are absolutely shocked to see that even the apartment living rooms are much bigger than the gym.  The mirrors give the photo the affect of appearing huge.  There were a few let downs like that, but overall we thought it was a pretty nice community with a decent location.  

The units are adequate.  I think the closet designs and doors are poor and the blinds seem old fashioned.  There is new carpeting and the units have great balconies or patios.  There's no laundry in the units so you have to share with about 12 or more others in your building.  Other than that they're not bad. 

The community itself has some really cool features like the pool, bar/grill, studio for aerobics classes, and basketball court.  Not things you see at every apartment community.

A friend of mine just moved in here and I can already tell parking is going to be an issue when I visit.  Also, the streets are not well lit and I don't know the area well enough to know if it is a safety concern.

They also brag about having your tv and internet included and ready to go when you move in, but after about 5 days, my friend still doesn't have internet and heard from Hotwire he'll have to pay $35 a month for it.  

Overall, I think these are some of the nicer, more affordable apartments in the area and with all the community activities and being located next to a major shopping center it seems like a pretty nice place to live.  I hope all those minor let downs don't become an issue for my friend and I have a feeling they won't.  Glad he moved in here."

Home Services,4.5,OR,"We used John Brown for years, but he retired to Florida.  Appliance business berry berry good to him!

I called John a few days ago. The gas oven went out a day after I got the Breville countertop oven http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-smart-oven-r.html I wanted for a long time. This was about a year ago.  Guess the GE wall oven was jealous of the new guy!

The Breville is so good that I never missed the big in the wall GE gas oven; but my wife said she must have the oven fixed to bake cookies for my nephew Zach's birthday party.

So back to the story, John Brown said that he worked with Bruce Fischer for years at Sears and they both started their own repair businesses.  John said that he sold his business to Bruce Fischer when he retired.

I called Fischers on the 2nd of July and they made an appointment for the 8th.

Carlos the tech - another Sears refugee - (perhaps Sears sucks to work at seems a lot of good guys bailed and started their own repair businesses) came after calling to say he was on the way, and diagnosed the problems and repaired 1/2 the oven (broiler) for $110 plus parts.

The second issue with the bake burner required an unusual part that they had to order - and it took longer then they thought it would take.  On Friday Fischer's called wanting to fix the oven on Wednesday the 16th.  I said how about today?  

Mission imposable we were told.  I asked for Bruce and long story short my wife got him to get Carlos back today the 12th.

Well our oven is fixed and while it cost about 350 all told, a replacement oven was over a grand so what choice did we have?  Fischer's did not charge additional labor for the second visit.

Carlos was skillful and clearly experienced in the way he did the job, and they used modern technology like i pads to do bills and see their schedules.

Cool."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"At the moment I am completely on the fence about these guys. I had someone come out to do an AC tune up and our unit being 12 years old wasn't working as well as it should have. When the guy got inside he opened up the current unit which I could see myself was rusted through. It would have been impossible to clean without it falling apart. 
My husband and I decided to go ahead and opt to replace it, with financing of course... since it's not really doable to pay for a whole unit up front.

Well... they replaced the unit and we had to head out for a while. Come back and the house is SWELTERING hot an we cant even get connected to the smart thermostat. According to them there was a minor issue with a valve which unfortunately isn't getting better so I am now waiting on someone to come BACK next day (today) to make the repairs. They say they will get someone out in the morning. Of course when I finally hear from them it's already after 9am and they're telling me they'll now be here around noon. 12:30 rolls around and no word from them so I call and am told they will find out where the technician is. Turns out the guys is JUST leaving Tampa to head my way... Winter Haven. Uhm, excuse me I have a 3pm appointment...? They say that the guy will get here and it wont take him very long to do what he needs to do. If I have to go for my appointment and come back they will work around my schedule. 

Sure the customer service aspect seems to be pacifying me but the actual quality of the service, at this point, I am quite disappointed with. All I can say is that when they leave today everything better be cooling off or they can bring my old one back. I hope it's smooth sailing from this point forward. Shall keep ya posted!"

The management is a absolute joke, they all have SIGNIFICANT attitudes anytime you call or walk in with even very basic questions.  The building I lived in and the one connected to me... was completely empty the entire I lived there, I had no neighbors and instead of fixing the holes in the fences, the glass on the ground or cleaning up the dump that accurateness on the grounds... they remodeled the gym and pay for 2 full time personal trainers.  The building are from the 70's and when I complained about the $200+ power bill for keeping my apartment at a reasonably comfortable temp...

As soon as they told me that I stated, okay great so they are from the 1970's that means that the property and the loans for the apartments have been more than paid... why did you decide to staff 2 full time trainers and remodel the gym instead of make VERY NEEDED improvements to the apartments???

I have asked him to provide the limited warranty I am entitled to in case his inspection misses something and he has blatantly refused to provide it blaming my realtor, the seller, and just about anyone except himself. This is not my first home and I have seamlessly had to deal with something major breaking down after a home inspection. The LIMITED WARRENTY SHOULD COVER IT! That's why you have it.

This man told me over the phone, and my sister and realtor who were in person during the inspection, the same thing. I even contacted the company Todd recommended to use for servicing the unit, in addition to 2 other companies I called myself. All 3 companies concluded the coils were leaking and had to be replaced, which would cost between 1,500-2,500, but that this would only be a temporary fix because the unit was in terrible condition and should be replaced. Todd is so dishonest that he called the company he recommended (Mike from C&S A/C Services) and asked him to call me to recant the whole assessment of needing a new unit!

I'm going through a very challenging time and had at a short notice move from Meridian, ID back to Seattle, Washington.  I had no time to clean my house, in between hauling a huge truck and car carrier over the mountains in the heart of winter.  I hired Boise Cleaning Maid Easy for a move-out clean which I scheduled the day after I moved out.  Tyler was very helpful and easy to work with right from the start.   

Tyler went above and beyond to clean out the rental I lived in and did a job that is beyond exceptional.  He not only cleaned the entire house, but cleaned out vents, the garage floor and well beyond anything I could have thought about.   I was needing Tyler to clean out the house so I could get back my $1100 deposit from my landlord and have a good reference.  

Well, my landlord was thoroughly impressed with the cleaning job and gave me back my entire deposit!   Tyler did a great job and was a real life saver.   He accommdated me in the most challenging situation.  He also did a walk through with me and gave me a written quote, unlike so many other places who will only give you an estimate and can charge you exorbitant fees on a move-out clean, which would be hard to contest if you move out of the area.  He was honest, easy to communicate with and straightforward.  His rates are very reasonable and his quality of service is exceptional! 

I would recommend Boise Cleaning Made Easy to anyone in the Boise area and believe he is the best cleaning service with the best rates in the Treasure Valley!   Thank you very much Tyler for your help and I will be certain to recommend you to anyone who needs your service in Boise."

The first person I dealt with was a woman by the name of Angela. I never rented from this company but I am a neighbor of a property that they manage. There are some issues we are having as neighbors of how the property was maintenanced and where the debris was left and also an illegal pipe that is being drained into a rear public alleyway. 

First I called to put a complaint in and I had the please of speaking to one of the most uneducated condescending person I have ever dealt with for someone who calls themself a Supervisor and dealing with people for her job. She even called me back after I  left a message for her to call me and upon me answering the phone she says Who's this? Instead of identifying herself and where she is calling from and then asking to speak to the person who left their name on her voicemail. After her greeting me then she started to blame me and start drilling me as if I was the person to blame. When asked who her Supervisor was she refused to give me their name and hung up on me. She was trying to get me to snap on her but I continued to be professional to her. 

I called back and did get the operator who was very nice. She gave me Angela's Supervisor name who is  Matt. She transferred me to him where his voicemail says to leave a message or email him. I did both. Left two messages and emailed over a week ago and still have not heard from this wonderful group of people that manage owner's properties.

I went to the store to look at the water heater and it was still leaking.  I called to let them know that the crew had not cleaned the water heater.  They told me that they would call back to say that they had found it.  They went back to the store and waited for them to come back.  I told them that I had never used a company like this before.  They said that the only way they could help was to contact the owner of the company.  They said that I was the only one who could contact them.  I asked them to call me back and they did.  They did call back again and they said that they would call me back when they got there.  They called back and they said that they would come back when they got there.  They told me that they would call back again and they did.  I told them that I was in the middle of an emergency.  They said that I was just being too busy.  I told them that I had a technician come in and he could do it himself.  They said that I could not do that because they were very busy.  I told them that I was going to call the owner to give me a call back to let me know that they were going to"
Home Services,1.0,OR,"Unit is nice but management is horrible. Try to get a repair done. It's like pulling teeth. No one bothers to call you back. Maintenance crew is skeletal and they have reportedly 200 or more new properties but don't have staff to cover the maintenance. Last year was without heat over an entire weekend during Covid and I'm diabetic (that's illegal). Wrote them a letter by email and called asking for a concession on the $182 electric bill I had received as well as climbing energy bills I sent copies of showing how the thermostat was climbing over a three month period. I asked for some sort of concession on my bill as I'm on a fixed income AND AM A SENIOR CITIZEN! They finally sent a one-liner text saying they wouldn't give me any concession in any amount. I pay my rent on time every month and am a stellar tenant. I'm expecting to see people file a class action lawsuit on Elite. They don't even keep the interior hallways clean. Dead bugs (roaches) are in the corners of the hallways. The lease says you can't put any pics on your walls and a $165 repainting fee for any damages when you move so. Isn't it customary to repaint due to normal wear and tear when a tenant has moved after living in a unit for 2-3 years?? They never send in a professional cleaning company when a tenant moves out. They only want your money and don't care if you're a satisfied tenant or not. You get a lot of fake polite thank yous from the people while they completely ignore any concerns you have! If they have the money to buy more properties why not be decent human beings and put some of that money into hiring qualified staff and caring, professional management! Clearly, money is the only thing that appears to be important to Elite Property Management. But, remember! You can't take it with you and there's more to happiness than money. How about common courtesy, good morals, ethics, and values!"
Home Services,2.0,CG,"Tailor's Cleaners is a terrible company. The guys who come out to clean my house are rude and unprofessional. They don't answer your call and then tell you to leave a message and that it's okay to call them. I would NEVER recommend them. This is a company that should be ashamed of themselves.

I would also suggest getting a refund on your deposit so you don't have to pay more than you paid for it to go up.I moved from New Orleans to San Francisco last weekend. I'm not sure if I've ever lived in a better place than here. The building is old and it is mostly used for parking. But there are some nice restaurants and bars around here that have been around for years. I've lived here for a year and I've had a great time here. The parking is very good and the property management is always very responsive. I don't recommend this place to anyone but would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to live here.I called and spoke with the owner, who was very friendly and helpful. He was extremely helpful and took the time to explain things. He was able to give me a quote and I was able to schedule an appointment to have the work done. 

I had a leak in my attic and it took a lot of time to fix it and he came out to help. He did a great job, he even took a walk through the attic and discovered the leak. The leak was fixed within a couple of hours. I highly recommend him and would recommend him to anyone.I've used him for almost a year now and have been so pleased with his service and the work he has done. He is very professional"
Home Services,2.0,CG,"Too bad zero stars is what happens when you try to fix a problem that is already fixed. 

I had a friend who was going to have a ""turnaround"" and he had to take his wife out of work to do it.  I had to call the tech and ask to speak to someone else to fix it.  I had to call the sales person who answered and she said she would not be there and that they needed to call me back.  I have been to the office multiple times and they have never called me back.  I never got a call back from them and never will.  They never showed up on time.  It is disappointing that I had to go and call a company to fix something that I had never even tried to fix before.  I wish I had the money to do the work myself.  I wish I had known what was going on before I called them.  I would have saved them time and money.  I wish I had known that they would not have been there for me.  I wish I had known that they would not have taken my wife out of work to do a turnaround.

Home Services,3.0,OR,"This is a horrible, horrible place. I called at 10 am and asked to make an appointment. The guy said they do not take appointments only walk ins, so I asked how long as I only had about an hour before I had to pick up my little brother from school. He said about an hour, so I headed straight over. When I got there he said again that it would be about an hour.  I left and eventually had to have a friend pick me and my brother up. Three hours later I decided it is time to call. One guy answered and asked me to hold, then another guy answered and asked me to hold. Finally, another guy answered and said they just barely looked at my car, that they cant't work on it, and that my entire engine was shifted back. Confused, as I just had my transmission serviced and my radiator filled. I asked how is this the case. The guy then got a horrible tone and preceded to argue with me. I screwed up and asked how it had taken 3 hours to decide this, when I was told it was going to take 1. When I got there the guy. who originally helped me, ignored me for about 10 minutes. When he finally acknowledged me I asked if he could explain to me what was going on with my car and also why he would tell me an hour if they were so busy. He preceded to tell me that was all in my head and that no one told me an hour... Then we went back to look at my car and he began arguing with me. I have never in my life ever heard anyone in a customer service position talk to anyone in the tone he was talking to me in. I am dumbfounded by it. I will never ever go here again and I suggest no one else go here, unless they want to be talked to in a tone they have never heard before."
Home Services,2.5,OR,"Didn't show up when he said he would. Said he'd arrive between 1pm and 6pm, but he showed up at 11am, so we weren't ready. My wife had to get out of the shower to open the door for him. He checked why my garage door wasn't opening and told me it was the motor since it was 20+ years old. That was good to know, since it wasn't the spring or rails. 

Then he tried to sell me a replacement motor for $750, like I wasn't going to google how much a motor costs. He kept telling me about a bunch of discounts that would make me only have to pay for the motor and not labor so it would just be $750 and not $950. When I said I'd have to talk to my wife about it before dropping almost $1000, he got more and more pushy, saying if I didn't agree to him doing the work right then and there, it would be even more expensive. Almost like he knew that if I google how much a motor costs or talked to anyone, I'd realize he was ripping me off. I had to tell him I wasn't having him do the work that day 6 times before he got the message. He kept offering different ways of spreading the cost over a year, and I kept saying ""it's still very expensive, no matter how long you spread it out for, and I need to talk about it with my wife"". Literally 6 times before he stopped being pushy.

Then he put a huge sticker on my door and on my old motor that says the warranty is void if I remove or cover the sticker. What warranty? He didn't work on my door or motor, just looked at it to tell me what was wrong.

The good news is that despite that, he technically did do what I wanted and told me what the problem was. I went to home depot and bought a motor for $150 and installed it myself. Now it works perfectly."
Home Services,1.5,CG,"Attention people...

Where do I even begin? The fact that you're a tenant who is paying rent every month is so upsetting. The fact that you're not even a tenant when you get a notice that they are evicting you is ridiculous. If you are going to be living here you should be paying rent every month or at least every month. 

I would like to see the landlord make a move on to the next tenant and tell us what they are doing to prevent this from happening. 

Would I recommend this property to anyone? Not at all. They just want to rent from you and your tenants. Please do your research and read the reviews first.I had a very nice apartment and was very happy with my experience.  I had a leaky bathroom tile and a leaky ceiling.  I called the apartment manager who came out to look and he was very kind and very helpful.  He did a very thorough job and was very knowledgeable.  I highly recommend them and will definitely call them again.I recently moved from Tampa to Tucson.  The guys at the office were very professional and accommodating.  I would recommend them to anyone looking to move into Tucson.I needed a new water heater and furnace installed and I had a leaky bathroom tile and ceiling.  

The plumber came out on time and did a great job.  He was very professional and efficient.  He cleaned up after himself and also did a great job replacing the old heater.

Home Services,1.5,OR,"If I could give negative stars, I would.  This was the absolute worst moving experience I had in my life.  I was scheduled for a pack and move on Thursday, May 31st at 8:30am.  The company owner--Cliff, strung me along for almost 9hrs!!! I had to call every hour to ask when the movers were coming.  During the day, I tried to find different companies so I could just cancel my move with AMS, but it was impossible.  No one was available. AMS movers decided to show up at 5:45pm!!! They did a half-a** packing job and left because it was too late to complete the job. AMS movers claimed they would come first thing in the morning the next day (June 1st). 
Next day--what happens? Repeat of previous day. No movers in the morning. I'm calling every hour until 11:30am.  AMS gets on the phone (can't remember this guy's name) and says the movers have all quit and walked off the job and there was nothing he could do.  ""Are you shi****g me!!!!?????!!"".  I was left with an apartment full of furniture with my elderly mother, a canceled hotel reservation with no refund for it (we were supposed be out of the unit on May 31st, but couldn't move into the new unit until June 1st), and no way to quickly hire another moving company same day. I was beyond pissed--I was shaking! Totally left high and dry! I will consider contacting KDSK to run a second story on this company. (you can find a story from February 2018 that was featured on there: https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/5-on-your-side/moving-nightmare-for-st-louis-woman-with-well-known-company/63-516720212).  I've already contacted the BBB to file a complaint (where they already have 80).  
I hope this is enough info for potential customers to understand they need to run the other way.  This company is deplorable and this location should be investigated and closed down. Also, I have yet to receive my deposit back from the company--if I don't in the next day, or two, I will undoubtedly take legal action."
Home Services,2.0,OR,"We are very unhappy with the Technical Support that COMCAST provided. If we do get a COMCAST technician that speaks english, and is based in the United States, and NOT India, or the Phillipines they are unable to support any call that involves more than sending a 'Modem Reset' signal. If the call requires support of a technical nature beyond pushing one button the call goes to a third world CALL CENTER. The level of service at this point is very poor in nearly every case we have had during the last 2 weeks.

I would have pulled all of my hair out if i did not have my Verizon Wireless Aircard. This allows me to connect to the INTERNET without using COMCAST. At least I can still work from home as i try to repair my COMCAST Internet connectivity.

I am a techical worker and have a computer networking background and currently work as a Database Administrator. I do work with off-shore, and near-shore resources at my day job. I do feel i am a good judge of skill sets when working with a Technical Support engineer. I must say the COMCAST technical support resources supporting the phones during the weekend shifts are VERY BAD,  YES... VERY BAD.
If you have other options for high-speed internet service do yourself a favor and choose that option prior wasting time and getting frustrated with COMCAST.

TO COMCAST ... WAKE UP.  Educate your on-shore call center workers. It may take a few years to upgrade the skills of the existing on-shore, American workers but it is the best investment in the long run. Running off-shore, and not training your on-shore workers is very short-sighted. The American, Tier 1 support person i spoke to initially had NO idea how she would be able to move into a more technical call center technician role.  COMCAST Educate your American workforce!!!!  ""Cowboy Up"", and get your American Call Center staff the skills that will make them more valuable to you and to your COMCAST Internet customers who are forced to use your Internet service."

Home Services,3.5,OR,"I was referred to David E. Callahan Pool Plastering by Aquavita Pools. I feared that I may need to have my pool plaster re-done. I invited this company out to look at my pool to see what needed to be done to it as it s 16 years old. I worked with a lovely woman named Anna to set the appointment for them to evaluate the pool. She had a great attitude and willingly played phone tag with me until we could speak and set up the inspection appointment which happened the next day. Anna even called me on the day of the appointment to give me Gerorge's most up to date time of arrival which was very accurate. George inspected my pool and told me that my plaster was a 7 of 10 and that I did not need to replace it - keep in mind that I called them to request a replacement of the plaster!  
George was very pleasant and I found him to be earnest &r helpful and he seems to enjoy his job and is very honest. He could have easily  :""sold"" me on re-doing the plaster in the pool but instead upon inspection of the pool he went to his truck and got a special sponge and taped it to a pole and showed me that I could eliminate the stains that made me think I had to replace the gunite. He also tooko  the time to offer me further advice as to what I could do to repair my pool issues on my own so as to not have to make an un-needed investment in his services. WHO DOES THAT TODAY?!?!
i'm writing this review and telling everyone I know that has a pool that they should have this company come out to evaluate their pool in the event that they think that they need work done because I found this company to be VERY HONEST & TRUSTWORTHY. I will look forward to working with this company in the future and you should feel comfortable doing the same."
