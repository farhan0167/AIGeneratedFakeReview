Restaurants,2.5,OR,Food and service is good like every other Chic Fil A but the drive thru wait is ridiculous I actually drive to the one on Gandy sometimes because it's that much faster

Restaurants,3.5,CG,This is my go to spot for breakfast. Great prices for the amount of food you get and the quality. Great drinks and the staff is very friendly. I have to say I was very disappointed.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Has gluten free bread - go here and you will thank me later. The food is always delicious and the service is always great. The staff is always friendly and very attentive.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Good service and free speech. Can't think of much that's more American than that. Disgusted to find so many reviews opposed on no other grounds than they don't like the free speech part. Truly saddening. I hope this place lasts a long time.

You should def give them a try!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Obviously this isn't a classy joint, but it's amazing.  The food is spectacular.  I prefer to take home my food, but staying in the place isn't that bad.  If you want a good classic cheesesteak this is where to go!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Due to the great location, this place does get busy during peak hours and weekend.  The price is friendly and food quality is decent.  Not the best, but decent for the price.  The deco is nice and seating is comfortable."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Love this neighborhood place. Both times I've been there, the owner was working the counter and was so friendly. The food is really good and has such a variety. Not the biggest space in terms of size, but the food comes out quickly!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My husband and I love this place, the pho has never once disappointed. I usually stick to the veggie pho, but my husband loves the beef (best in the city) and the shrimp wontons. Very quick and clean service."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Amazing traditional New Orleans food! This is the place where locals hang out! Loved the jambalaya and gumbo.... drinks are good and cheap! It does look like a hole on the wall and a little scary front he outside but it's a must!

Restaurants,4.5,OR,Owned by one family: a man and his wife. She cooks everything with love. The food was delicious but I would say that the injera wasn't as sour as I would have liked. Each person will spend an average of $15-$20 per meal.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've been coming here for about 15 years and I'm just now getting around to writing about it. In my opinion, which lets face it, no one cares about, their papusa's are just fucking delicious! There frankly, is no better value in town."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Gearo's is one of my favorite pizzerias! A mainstay in Northeast Philadelphia for decades! Awesome pizza and other menu items. Great service and delicious food at reasonable prices. Also a good place to watch the local Philly major league games in the bar.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,This place has really gone downhill since my last visit. They still had their Christmas decorations up in March.  We were the only customers for lunch on a Friday. Food was ok but restaurant really needs some updates and bathrooms were dirty.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Lots of meat! Thats the best part. One thing I'd recommend is asking if this is the customers first time and if they needed help ordering. Other than that the food is mediocre and expensive. Very fresh and that's what people like !

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Downgrading to 3 stars.  They can't seem to get my order right, not a single one.

3 tacos, carne asada with ONLY onions and cilantro.(classic authentic taco).  How is it possible you can give me everything except onions and cilantro every single time?"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,This place makes one of the best Old Fashioneds I've had in Southern California. The food is also really great. I highly recommend getting the bison burger paired with an Old Fashioned. Will definitely be making another trip back to explore other menu items.

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"They have a really small selection of food, compared to other Chinese buffet. I love their crawfish, crab, coconut chicken (?), and ice cream. I would recommend people to come here at dinner time as they don't serve crabs and crawfish in the morning."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My favorite Chinese takeout restaurant! They have some uncommon menu items like sesame balls and chow fun. Don't expect it to be anywhere near as good as what you'd find at a dim sum or nice sit down restaurant, but it's decent for takeout."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,Came in because of the yelp reviews and was glad I did. This was a true NY style pizza in texture and taste. Walter is passionate about his craft and it comes through in the pizza. First meal in Reno and it was great!

Restaurants,4.5,OR,I can't stop daydreaming about those Kimchi Fries!!! Pork Bulgogi was excellent. The gyoza was soooo goooood. I was slightly underwhelmed by the Chicken Bulgogi but the light and crunchy shrimp tempura more than made up for it. I only wish I lived closer...

Restaurants,3.5,OR,Great views and drinks but the service was terrible. Had to find our own menus and our waitress kept walking away when only three of the 7 people had ordered drinks. If it weren't for the atmosphere I would have given a one star
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Please do yourself a favor and check this place out.  It has some out of this world food. Stop for lunch with some cooked food or grab yourself some fresh groceries for the house.  This place has a variety like no other.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,Their chicken lollipop tasted like it had been sitting out in the cold. The cheese was burnt and the chicken was not crisp. The meat was also dry. The chicken was a little undercooked.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,Really good tacos and if you like a little spice you'll be happy.  The chicken tortilla soup was very tasty.  The grilled corn was good but 1/4 edible because it was burnt.  Overall the experience was good and the food very tasty.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great food. I don't understand why the buffet is about $12 and ordering an entree is like $22. So if I eat 3 different meats on the buffet, it's $12 but if I want them to go it's $66? Weird. Individual meals are too expensive."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"One of the best Pho soup I've had delivered yet!  I will be ordering from here again.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Better than average. Buffet had the mandatory Chicken Tikka Masala, but also a lot of other great entrees. Quality was very good. Better than good not Outstanding. But jeez, $8.50?! If you like Indian, or have never tried it but want to, I recommend it."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Every time I come here they managed to get my order wrong. And don't ever come here in a hurry because you will wait 15-30 minutes. Also, everyone is sassy. especially when you're explaining your wrong order. Good luck if you decide to come here."

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Just go! Food is amazing, so your most basic reason for going is met (Gumbo & shrimp stew), it is everything else that makes this place one of the most authentic NOLA experiences. Will (server) is family the minute you enter. JUST GO! Tip in cash"

Restaurants,3.5,OR,Been a regular here since my college days (over 5 years ago). Consistently great food and service. Th bartenders change out but they're always nice and make a mean margarita. I am forever a fan of Felipe's (every location)! It becomes a family after a while.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,This place was wonderful. The only thing better than the food was the service. Rashida our server was fabulous. She made our evening just so enjoyable. The choices are numerous and prepared perfectly. It is worth making the trip if you are not in the area.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We are traveling full-time and trying out pizza across America.  Marco's was a great stop with incredibly friendly staff and good pizza.  We had pepperoni pizza and a white pizza.  Both were good but pepperoni was better.  Good place for classic pizza.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"2 hr wait!!  We had an amazing time and will be back again!We came here for the first time on a Saturday night, and it was pretty packed.  The restaurant was nice, and the service was good. "
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Super authentic little hole in the wall pizza place.  I will say that the dough was pretty good.  The toppings are a bit small but the flavor was good.  The pizza is a little hard to get to your table
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Stopped in for a late lunch. The menu is very extensive and offers a wide variety of dishes. We had the burrito, a burrito with chorizo, a burrito with chicken, and a burrito with a"

Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Great service here, notwithstanding the fact it was busy. I saw a lot of people order the same thing and we had to ask for different things. The food was great, especially the seafood gumbo."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,The stars are for the atmosphere. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow. The atmosphere is not very cool. The food is not the best but the drinks are pretty good. The only reason I am giving 4 stars
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"It is just not fair that a restaurant with a menu of its own is treated this way. The owner is not the best person, but he is the worst customer service. I will never go back to this place."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I must say this has become my go-to place for Indian food! The food is always delicious and so is the service. The food is freshly made and the portions are very large. I highly recommend this place!We went to
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Best darn Mexican food in Tampa. The food is amazing and the service is great. I recommend the carnitas tacos. The food is delicious and the drinks are great. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Love this coffee shop in Tampa. The coffee is good, but not spectacular. I like the coffee here. The staff is nice, but they're not very friendly. They don't have a menu, so I'd recommend going to"

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Terrible breakfast!!! Burnt fries burnt hash browns. Whites on dippy eggs not cooked, slimy not good.  Server not friendly at all. This was my second time there and I will NOT go back. I should of went to my favorite, First Watch which is ALWAYS consistent."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was just passing through St Louis and was in the mood for Persian/ Middle Eastern food. food was authentic and delicious. Ordered more than I could eat which worked out great the next day. 
Mint tea was also a nice treat and would recommend having it."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"This place has changed dramatically for better over the past five years.Years ago,you would walk inside,and it seems as if you were on streets of North Philly.

Now,the place is great,clean,and the employees are serving with a smile.I would suggest this location to anyone who is passing through."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Great place for quick Italian food, love the breadsticks! My favorite meal here is the Penne Romano very tasty! The kids love the pizza very much so it's a win win for everyone! The staff is very nice and super quick at getting your meal to you!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Cute place in the quaint Soulard neighborhood; however not the greatest place for a late night nosh.  Servers are annoyed to provide service and have little knowledge of available eats.  Bad attitude seems to have been born here.  The flat bread was tasty though!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"All tamales are frozen, no fresh or warm tamales due to covid, $6.99 for two frozen tamales on a plastic bag , very disappointed, No SWEET TAMALES , you are tamale company and no sweet Tamales, not worth the drive of 1 1/2 hours to this placed."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"This location has a newer management team and you can tell the difference on what it was like before. 
Lots of training going on but it nice to see employees actually enjoy what they do.
And the food is coming out hot and fresh. 
It's a great change."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Arrived around 10 30 am on 4th of July. The wait was about 20 minutes. The host and server were very friendly. We ordered eggs benedict, victorian special, and the ham steak. The food came out very fast and was correct. Everything was very delicious! Definitely recommend!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Very well appointed classy/quiet dining room with great chairs.

Steamer clams bucket, fried fisherman platter, and classic clam chowder were all rock star. The fish they used on the platter was haddock - such a first class move.

Service was super friendly and my diet coke was always filled."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The chorizo con queso is amazing!  The chicken tacos are great too.  Did not care for the asada tacos though, they were bland and the meat was too chewy.  I've been there twice and both times the line was long, but worth the wait."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Nachos were okay. Queso was average.. the Mexican drinks are disgusting. Queso really does not have any flavor. People who come here and likes it must have been drunk on a weekend. Would most likely never order from here again.....maybe if I'm drunk. It's tied with Taco.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Loved everything we ate but dropped a start because my coffee mug flaked first time I washed it. I've never had a coffee mug do that so didn't think to hand wash it. Just a heads up if you're buying any souvenirs there :(  Seems cheap.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Be careful, if you don't associate with the ""type"" of people that go to this bar then they won't let you in. 

We waited for 25+ minutes before being refused entry because we weren't ""like"" the other people inside."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"All I can say is wow!!! Wish we took pics of our amazing sushi rolls. We had the Bob and the Dee. Can't wait to go back for more. Top notch sushi, our new local favorite. Service was great and it's so clean."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Love this place!

Only thing I could say would be to get bigger go cups for drinks orders."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This should have 10 stars. Always fast, always friendly, always fresh!! You can also call in your orders so there ready to be pick up when you walk in. Cash only so do not show up with a debit card. The line is often out the door!!!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,The good is great! I got the bone in naked chicken wings garlic parmasean flavor! It's great! I've also tried their rib eye steak here and you won't be disappointed. The service is amazing also. They do have cute servers. Today they were cute short servers .
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I give them 1 star but in reality chili's is not worth going to anymore except for the chocolate molten cake.other than that it's a waste of money every chili's in Tampa or Brandon ,they don't even have ceaser dressing for God sake or buffalo chicken fajitas"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but I saw a lot of people eating here. I had the burrito and it was good but the flavor was not great. The rice was soggy and the beans were a"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,It feels like a tourist trap. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I am from
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"A coworker took me her recommendation of the ""Wine Bar"" and I have to say, I wasn't impressed. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was slow and slow. The only reason I gave it 4 stars"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,We loved this place. We had the crab cakes and the shrimp and grits. Both were delicious. The crab cake was good but the grits were a little over cooked.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"What a hidden gem, especially for the price. I will definitely be back!Very good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"There are 2 good reasons to go here:
1) The parking lot is small and the seating is so small. The front of the house is huge and the inside is very large. 2) The service was good."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,The place is greasy. The server has the personality of a jerk. She is slow and rude. The food is not very good. The fries are not fresh. The only reason I go is because it is so convenient.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place has amazing desserts. We had the almond butter cake, chocolate mousse cake, and the coconut cake. The mousse cake was delicious and the coconut cake was so yummy. We had the fried chicken and the sweet potato fries"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I have been spoiled with some of the best food in Nashville.  This is the first restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of eating at and I have never had a bad meal.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"There's no real ""good"" way to describe the food here. I will say that the best thing about this place is the atmosphere. The food is good but the service is terrible. I go here with a group of friends and they"

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was very impressed by this place.  The pizza selection was special and unique, much like the pizza specials in barbuzzo in the city. It's nice to be able to find a place like this in a small neighborhood.  Their sliders are a must try too."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Definitely a great spot to go to in New Orleans. The food is excellent! They do offer happy hour, but only on drinks. We loved all the food that we ordered and would definitely come back. I love the Caribbean twist that this establishment."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Heard about this place from a co worker so gave it a shot.   Roll was nice and fresh and the meat.   Odd no lettuce on the sandwiches but still good.   Wish they had crushed peppers!  Bf liked the homemade sweet peppers.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Awesome service. Fantastic food. I got the $30 tasting menu and wasn't able to finish my dessert so I got it to go, but instead our server gave me a free chocolate tort!! Defiantly going there again. Everything we had was just phenomenal. We had a great time!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city ! Great service , great food & drinks !! I love the Sangria ! I almost feel like I am back in Spain when I am at Amada , but then I leave and I am back in Philly ."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"What could beat out a freshly baked, delicious, giant chocolate chip cookie? If you're thinking nothing then you're not being creative enough. How about you take that cookie and cover it in chocolate? 

""Who wants cookies?"" (the beckoning call of 4th Street echoing through Reading Terminal) This guy!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Working in town & had an over night stay. Decided for a quick bite. Looked it up & saw the reviews, so gave it a try. Worth Every Penny!!! 5 rolls & 4 beers $50.00 bucks.. Good, Fresh & Cheap.. will stop in again next time in town."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Hostess was super rude to our party of five which docs them a star.  We ordered fried alligator (tastes like chicken!), Gumbo (super good & spicy), blackened shrimp (da bomb!!), alfredo (super good!)...their red beans were amazing....great spot just wish the hostess didn't set a bad tone."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Bad service. Their  server didn't even know what days they open. They took our reservation for Tuesday but it is closed on Tuesday. We are a group of six friends who work at different part of the town. It was a waste of everyone's time and money.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Came for family weekend and had a great meal.  Very nice atmosphere and the staff was excellent.  It was a little further away from the school (UofA) but we were glad we found it.  Also has a very large wine list and something for everyone.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Locals love this place and I understand why, excellent service, outstanding food! Everything was fresh and local. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Listen to waiter's advice and you will be so happy with your food. We were the only tourists in the place, great atmosphere!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,The food was amazing here! The restaurant it self is gorgeous and has an awesome vibe. The only reason j didn't give it 5 is because the waitress forgot about is for quite some time but besides that I would return here every time I come to Indy!
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"If you go to this Taco Bell at 2:01 and order a happy hour Pepsi, they charge you $1.82 instead of the  advertised $1.00. Their clocks are off and the poor kid working there would not budge. Well that $.82 cost you my business. Fix your clocks."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,We had an awesome time chatting with Russ. It was just him and us. We did follow all the governor's directives too! He gave my husband some delicious whiskey and made me the best drink I have ever had...EVER. We will be back for sure! Love you Russ!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Was there last night. The clam chowder was very good unfortunately that's the only good part of the evening. Service was horrible. Our server was rude and unprofessional. I'd like to come back for the all you can eat crab legs. Guess we will see if things improve.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Probably the best pizza place in the Reno area. The ""mondo"" pizza is a great deal and their garlic bread is also great. Their pizza reminds me of Shakey's pizza in the Sacramento area. They say you like the food you grew up with! We are now regulars!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We came here a couple times for wine tasting and dinner. The value of the wine tasting (lux) was terrific. We all sat down at the dinner table with a nice buzz. The food was pretty good, but certainly not 5 star quality. The customer service was superb."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Don't believe the other negative reviews below. This place is actually pretty decent. The service was solid and helpful, the sushi was above average, the noodle bowls/fried rice/Pad Thai were all solid. The fourth star is given BECAUSE it's in an airport (anywhere else it would being 3*)."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Our meal: Corn chowder, Mac and cheese, and the fried green tomatoes. All were excellent!

I had the prime rib. The rib was cooked perfectly and the greens were cooked perfectly. The Mac and cheese was amazing."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"The few times I have been here, the food is good but not spectacular. I have ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken is dry and the waffles are a bit dry. I have had the breakfast burrito which is good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Went here a couple of weeks ago and the food was good but not spectacular. I ordered the duck confit and the fries. The duck was dry, the fries were great, and the duck was well seasoned."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I tried the Crazy Salmon and it was amazing! The salmon was cooked perfectly and the veggies were cooked perfectly. The Salmon was also a must try and the flavor was so great. The rice was also so fresh and delicious.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Beers were good. Clams in a sweet sauce with shrimp in a cold sauce was just the way I wanted them. Great drinks and food. Will definitely come back.I'm a fan of this place. I have been here twice in

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Yes me and my niece, it's the best fried chicken in town! The best! 

The only thing I don't like is that the flavor of the chicken is so bad it's almost hard to eat."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I'm so glad that we decided to go. We decided to split a salad for the first time. It was delicious. The dressing was a bit too sweet and the greens were very large. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Friendly staff. Great food with a fun atmosphere. Great prices too. Also, great service!I've been coming here for years. The food is always fresh and tasty. The staff is always friendly and attentive."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Over-friendly cat included in outdoor seating. The menu is diverse and full of vegetarian options. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious. The sauce was light and creamy. I would definitely go back.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Great ice cream place and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely come back!Very good. Very fast service. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I would not recommend Houlihan's.  The food is just ok.  The service is slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant.  There is also a very long wait for food.  If you are in the area,"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I miss the pizza I had last night. It was good but not spectacular. I would go back. If I had to choose, I would get the Treme. The crust was nice and soft and the sauce was good."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"This was the third dominos location I've been to in Nashville.  This time I went with the other two locations.  I got a cheese pizza, a chicken salad, and a chicken salad.  The pizza was good, but nothing"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place plays awful music, and has the worst food in Nashville. The food is good. The drinks are decent, but the food is not worth the money. I was so excited to try this place."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Service was decent and food was tasty. We ordered the shrimp and grits and the crawfish etouffee. The etouffee was okay, but the shrimp and grits were a little over cooked."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Sandwiches at this place were amazing. We both had the BBQ pork and loved it. Friendly cooks and a fully stocked bar to grab a beer next door. What else could you want. I will go out of my way to come back next time I am in town.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"First time at the World Café Live and We enjoy the live music & venue atmosphere. We were able to find parking near the Café ( Parking Meters ). One waiter / full house. We Reserve a Table , Food very satisfying. The jazz band started on time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Update to my last reviews
Downgraded to 3 stars due to:

$15 for 6 small grilled oysters - seriously??
Limited menu, inside ambiance and is just fair 

In a town like this you can do better. 
As they say at any crime scene ... move along 
There's nothing to see here folks."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,I call at 8pm to place an order when the website says they close at 9pm. The lady answered the phone to take my order then says they are closed. When i asked why when they close at 9 she all of a sudden forgot how to speak English.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Chicken only but it is good! Keeps menu and ordering simple. Fries are waffle style so make sure you eat them hot. 

Can get very busy during lunch hours but they do their best at speed. Always a pleasure for them to serve you.  

Chick-Fil-A sauce a favorite."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. 10x better than Buffalo Wild Wings, the wings here are one of the best I've ever had. Service is great, servers are very friendly, and the food is always good. They have a bunch of choices to choose from."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Grabbed an iced coffee at the downtown cafe during Gen Con.  Even though the line was long they had a system in place that was efficient and made for a short wait and they made one of the best ice coffees I have had in a long time.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"One of my favorite places in Philadelphia. I always get the George Bernard Shaw ($8.35) which includes ""3 cheeses: Swiss, American & Provolone, melted on top of green peppers, onions mushrooms & tomatoes. Top with fresh romaine & our special sauce on a kaiser"". The service is usually quick."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,If you like cheap drinks and drunken debauchery- definitely check out Jeff's Pub! It's a comfortable neighborhood bar with pool and karaoke (on Fridays). There are people of all ages and walks of life. I have a good time whenever I stop in! The bartenders are pretty cool too...
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Friendly service. Amazing food. We've been there now about four times and everything that we've ordered has been spot on. If you're into spicy food, this is truly spicy when asked for or when listed.  Recommend the pumpkin curry, khao soi chicken, and the basil spicy crispy chicken!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Okay so our favorite sushi place just closed and we have been on the hunt for a new spot......this is it!  Stumbled upon this and sushi was super fresh, unique rolls and great staff.

Basically I would eat this all day every day!  Worth the drive from downtown."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The best coffee and brunch in town.  Hands down.  This is my go-to spot when I'm in Indiana.  Why go anywhere else?  Yum!  

I love the food, the coffee is perfect.

A++

I don't say that much, but this place is wonderful.

Cannot wait to go back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was so looking forward to going here and loving it because I love ""hole-in-the-wall"" restaurants. They usually have good food. But I was not that impressed. It was just average Mexican food. Carmelitas is so much better! It does deserve another try since I've only been here once."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Outstanding service, extremely pleasant and genuine bar-backs, great music, and tasty food. Loved everything about this spot and will definitely continue to visit... 
Oh yea food I ordered - char grilled oysters (first time ever tasting), bbq shrimp, and the crawfish pasta. Pasta was phenomenal as was the ambience."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place is fun and has good drinks but extremely greasy food.  My friend had the smoked chicken which was less greasy than the pulled pork, not surprising..  The sides are almost inedible.  And I'm from GA so I'm used to southern cooking. Great  service."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Good pastor tacos.
Great complementary avocado salsa.
Salsa verse spicer than normal.
Red salsa pretty good.
Chewier tripe vs crispy tripe.
Lengua a little on the dry side according to my husband but I found it more palatable since I'm not a big fan of it anyway.
Will go back to try the corn bowl."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This the best Pho place I've ever been to. (I've been to a lot!) we ordered seafood pho, the combination pho & a pork Vietnamese sandwich. Great service, GREAT FOOD. Honestly I wish I lived close by, even in California it's hard to find a place this good! 10/10!"
Restaurants,5.0,CG,This place is awesome!! I had the mushroom curry and it was amazing. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great. The food was delicious and the staff was very attentive. I will definitely be going back and will be back to try other things
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Nice place, Authentic food, Amazing service. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the owner is a jerk.  The food is mediocre at best, if not the worst I've ever had.  The service was good, but"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Bad service from screwing up our order and the food was cold. 

The only reason we give it 5 stars is because our waitress was very nice and the food was very good.The food was great. The server was a bit slow"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"The freshest, best tasting sushi in the area.We decided to try this place for the first time. We had reservations and the place was packed. The hostess was nice and very accommodating. She came over and greeted us at the door."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I had a bad experience here. The food was ok but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our food and then the manager came to take our order. He came back and said we were out of the food.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"The roast chicken is to die for, the crunchy tender chicken is crunchy and flavorful, and the mashed potatoes are delicious. The fries are crispy, and the greens are crisp and flavorful. The only complaint is that the fryer was a little"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"It's a little pricey, but it's worth the money. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty good, but the food was not great. The only thing that was good was the bread."

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Not the same quality as what you get at the other two locations.

The food is good.  The drinks are decent, but they're not very tasty.  I've been to many other locations and this one is a bit better."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Had an excellent dinner last night. The food was amazing. My husband had the fish and chips. He said it was the best he has ever had. He said the drinks were amazing too. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Pulled pork at it's best. Not a huge fan of the BBQ sauce.

The brisket was a little too fatty for my liking. Not the best brisket I've had, but it was okay. It was good enough to"

Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Had lunch here a few weeks ago and the food was good but not spectacular. I ordered the duck confit and the dish came out before the duck, which was a shame because it was cooked perfectly. The duck was good, but nothing special."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Yum! Pastries flaky and buttery, and an amazing cinnamon crunch. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to get your coffee and then have a drink, you can go to the bar and order from the"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"They have a Tuesday discounts BUT there is a catch --- if you want less salt and less oil, they WON'T do it on Tuesdays (claims too busy). For sure, I won't bother them too. Save my money. Their food are usually salty and greasy, definitely not for good health."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great place!  Quiet atmosphere, awesome service, great staff that will chat you up. Amazing wine selection and iPads(menus) with an app that will help you select the best wine. also ask for a sample if your still curious. Great place to start or finish your night."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I have been here several times during the covid situation. Although the drive their lines were long, staff was organized and efficient. Both times I quickly moved through the line and got my food safely.  They were obviously taking precautions to try and protect customers and I appreciated that."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Mediocre and expensive fast food Mexican. Three tacos are being charge by the unit. I could get a nice slab of steak for that price. The salsa bar is good and the pico is a great addition to the otherwise blend burrito. Make sure to ask for an extra napkins.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"OH MAN THIS PLACE IS GREAT, good thing this place is pretty much the first time I bought a pastrami sandwich, now every other place I have ordered a pastrami sandwich sucks. I can't enjoy a pastrami dog, sandwich or anything that has pastrami from anywhere else because of Norton's."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,No no no wasn't good. First let me say this is a chain restaurant so I should have known. Prices were ok but the food wasn't anything to be excited about. Then they sat us by trash cans outside with like 5 million flies.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was in the area today and decided to get my gyro fix. For two gyros it was just under 19 bucks. My wife and I were less than impressed. The gyros were noticeably smaller and less tasty than before. For 19 bucks, I'll look for a new gyro place."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had dinner here last night. Delicious food, great wine list and fantastic service. Our server, Emma, was an absolute gem. Very friendly, offered great suggestions without being overbearing and just an absolute delight. Only complaint was that the dining room was a bit on the dark side."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,I'm a plain Jane who doesn't eat Mexican food. I tried Izzo's burrito in a bowl and boy my life has changed. The staff was friendly. Recommended the southwest ceasar dressing on top of my steak bowl. It was delicious!!! I've been back several times since. Always nice. Always fresh.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great place, wonderful food and extremely friendly staff! 

Came in with the family (3 young kids), and all ordered from the regular menu, with the help of our server. Everyone loved their food, and the Grilled Watermelon was amazing! They even had a very spicy local beer which I enjoyed."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great beer and delicious food - loved the service too once we were seated. Extremely tight quarters inside on a Saturday night. We ended up sitting outside within 10 minutes (although the hostess said it would take an hour and a half, which was odd.) Otherwise, we loved it here."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The staff at this location really care about their customers. They always go above and beyond to make sure you have the best experience possible. If something is wrong or a mistake is made, they make sure it is corrected, and do so with a smile. Always enjoy eating here."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Wait was a little long as they are trying to get it figured out. I had the pastrami and bacon sandwich and it was awesome next level stuff. Potato salad is tasty. Have a good German beer with the pastrami! Look out Native Grill( this place beats you hands down).
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Wow!!!  Took me back to what donuts used to taste like.  So worth the drive for a perfect glazed donut...fluffy with a little chew.  The glazed chocolate cake brought memories of Sunday mornings after church with my sweet Father.  Well done Bakers Dozen! We'll be back:)
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"It's hard to find a REAL hometown cafe anymore and this place is it! Crazy busy all the time, with generous proportions, a great place for breakfast for the whole family! I love their coffee and daily specials (especially the Mexican scrambles) my kids love everything they've tried."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"So crowded but authentic (well who am I to judge)?

They are so fast I overheard that the sell thousand every day! You can add a bunch of stuff you don't have to try the must original one. 

Seatings are mainly available 2nd floor. It's crowded but the turnover is fast."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Just ate here and I have to say the service was super speedy. The food we ordered literally came out in about 5 minutes and it was piping hot which was awesome! The waitress was very attentive and would come over periodically to see if we needed anything as well.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,A cool environment with friendly staff. The food is just ok. The salad bar is tiny and the other two items are pretty pricey. There's also a $20 cover charge for the entree. I'd rather be at a local coffee shop.
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I got the Tuscan grilled chicken with mushroom and sausage. It was pretty good, I would say. It's not the best I've had, but the flavor was good. I would definitely go back. The service was good."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"went out with my boyfriend and had the seafood combo which was a nice size for the price. The other two we had the duck, mussels, and shrimp. Everything was very good. We also had the shrimp and grits which were also very good"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Longtime customer,  Ate @ Rosie's for dinner. The waitress was friendly and attentive. If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant in a strip mall setting, Rosie's is a good choice."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Had the one pound T-bone and it was good, but I didn't like it. I ordered the chicken burger and the fries. The fries were crispy, but not greasy. The chicken burger was okay, but not good enough to keep me"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Last minute decision--quick reservation via Yelp. The hostess was very rude and didn't seem to care. We waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes and the hostess finally came and took our order. We ordered the salmon, grouper sandwich,"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Super delicious cafe food. I had the mushroom curry and it was fantastic. The cheese was fresh and the curry was delicious. The banana pudding was also fantastic!I love this place. The food is always great and the service is always great.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Best pizza on the beach.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the service is so slow.  I've been to the beach a couple times and it's been pretty good.  It's a little pricey for what you get
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I have NEVER left there disappointed. The food is amazing and the service is always excellent. If you're looking for a great spot for a good meal, you're in the right place. The food was great. The server was a bit slow."
Restaurants,2.0,CG,I stop here frequently on my way home from work. I always get the cheese steak and the fries. The cheese steak is the best I have ever had. The fries are very good too. They are fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Finally tried Joey's and it was a great experience. We started with a salad, the charbroiled oysters and the crab cakes. We also ordered the Tater tots and it was amazing. We also ordered the smoked salmon which was also very"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Great Italian food!  I had the mushroom ravioli and it was delicious.  I ordered the gnocchi and it was a delicious Italian dish!  The restaurant is very clean and it's a little quiet in there so it's a good
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This small but popular bar/restaurant that has been around forever. I will admit that I have been there twice since opening.  The first time was with my boyfriend and we had a great time.  The second time we were at a local
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Let me tell you Reno!!! We have been to many Reno restaurants and this one is the best one. We are not the best people, but they have the best food. The food is so good and the service is amazing. We will be back."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Didn't received what I ordered. We had the crab cakes which were cold. The cheese steak was awesome. We had the prime rib. The prime rib was okay. The prime rib was over cooked. The prime rib was over cooked.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,this place is amazing the food is amazing the service is amazing the people are always very friendly and the atmosphere is great the best place for a good meal the best place to go for a nice meal and a great time in New OrleansI came here for the
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"45 minute wait for what seemed to be an order of two pizzas, a small order of fries and two small beers. When our food arrived, the pizzas had a very large amount of dough and no seasoning. The fries were extremely salty."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Slow service. Good atmosphere. The server was nice and attentive. I will return for sure!Very good. I had the Chicken Tenderloin, which was a great choice. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the broth was fresh."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Turns out you just need to know the right thing to order! The Hangover Noodles are great, and our friends enjoyed it too. They are good for the hangover, though I'm sure it would be good even if you aren't nursing a headache from the night before!
Good customer service, fun location."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Dok bok ki is delicious, but spicy so consider yourself warned! Great sushi.  Always crowded & noisy ...because its so good.  You will not feel as if you are in a suburban strip mall. Coming here is the best part of visiting my parents. Shh,  don't tell them."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Gorgeous setting but spotty service and iffy food. We were given the wrong bill, one dessert drink was forgotten, the mushroom pasta had few mushrooms, and the skate was excessively salty (making it taste bad and raising suspicions that they were trying to hide a lack of freshness in this seafood)."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Worth the long line. Crawfish etouffee was the best I've ever tasted. Oysters weren't our favorite (we got raw). They were very big and lacked much flavor/brine. Everything everyone else got was delicious aside from the oysters, and the service was much enjoyed by all! Put this one on your list!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Bartender we had was excellent. Best mezcal negroni you'll find in the city. I mean, it's also the only mezcal negroni I've had in this city. Margaritas were also excellent. Ambiance is ok. And drink prices are more affordable than a New York rooftop hotel bar would be! I'd go back."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Awesome bar tenders. Awesome food. I love the inside. 
I know most people that like this place love the outside. I don't. I brought my dog and there was some broken glass and trash everywhere. So I didn't really want him in there. 
For humans it's perfect!
It's a staple out west."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Very small inside there is barely room at the tables to sit let alone eat. We went during restaurant week and the servers were rushing us and kind of rude. The food was very OK. I wouldn't go back and I have had way better elsewhere.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've been here for breakfast twice and their food is very good. The buckwheat pancakes are my favorite and the bacon is thick and very tasty, although a little too salty for me. Since the portion of bacon was so large, I took some home and made an omelet with it."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Wow. This place was very good. Came here for a Saturday night dinner with some friends and OMG it was delicious!  Had a few cocktails (cucumber martini and amazing) and the jalapeño poppers and I was impressed. Will definitely be coming back to this place very soon.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Cheeseburgers are delicious!  But what is even better is the salted caramel milkshake!  OMG - such a yummy place.  My daughter and I usually split a burger, but we liked it so much we ordered a second one!  

Burgers came out super fast and service was great."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Best grilled ham and cheese Ive had in my life. The sauce they put on it is amazing. Service is fantastic and I love the outdoor seating. My only complaint was the lobster mac and cheese. It was watery and flavorless so I didnt eat it but everything else was exceptional
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Good variety of food at a fairly reasonable price. Coffee is ok but not strong enough for me. I had a reuben sandwich on brown which was good. My sister had a breakfest meal and was satisfied. We went on a Wednesday do did not wait too long for our meal.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went the other night for what was perhaps the worst tasting gnocchi ever.  It was awful. Of the five of us who ordered, only one ate the entree. The rest of us could not force ourselves to eat the food. So bad. Stale bread. Meh. Such a disappointment. Not recommended."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The vibe was great, very hip and modern. My three children, husband and I were looking forward to a hearty breakfast before driving to Idaho however this place completely missed the mark for us. Food was pretty bland and service was just ok. Visited early morning (8:30 am) on a Saturday."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Was visiting new orleans for the first time and i was not disappointed. The trip consisted of many amazing meals and the seafood gumbo from the gumbo shop was one of them. We also had the alligator sausage and jambalaya which were very delicious. It's a must when visiting new orleans
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had visited on an earlier occasion at lunch and the food was fantastic! Unfortunately tonight it took 3 tries to get the burger right. We were eventually given a free coupon for our next visit. Forty-five minutes later when everyone else was done, my burger came out. Not a good experience."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Lucky you can drink beer while you wait in line! That made the wait better and worth it. The chicken tenders were juicy and big! I ordered the hot and very hot. Let's just say get regular hot if you want to enjoy your chicken lol. I learned the hard way.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We've eaten so many many places in Carmel, and this is our favorite! The food is so very tasty. Get it hot (spicy) because it all tastes so good that way! Green Curry was delicious, as was the pad Thai and pad see ew. We can't recommend this place highly enough!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Impeccable service. I took a few minutes to be greeted and was told by my waitress that I would have to wait for the check. I was told by the manager that the table was ready for takeout.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Best breakfast ever!! And they are always so friendly and accommodating. If you're looking for a new breakfast spot, this is your place. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. The food was great. The server was a bit slow."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Life long SoCal native with a sweet tooth. We decided to try this place for the first time. We had the burrito, which was good but the flavor was not great. The rice was soggy and the beans were not very flavorful."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Ohhhhh my gosh! Everything about this place is amazing! The food is fresh, the service is awesome, and the atmosphere is amazing. The only negative is the waitstaff. They were so nice and accommodating. It's a good place to bring a"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"While in town for work, I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was a bit chewy and had a weird texture, but the grits were tasty. The gumbo was pretty good. The service was good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Why a 5?  A 5. We left happy, full and full. I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was amazing. It was moist and flavorful."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,A family favorite. Food is always top notch and prices are reasonable. The best thing about this place is the atmosphere. The food is always fresh and tasty. I go here with a group of friends every Friday night.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,My husband and I went here for the first time in a month. We were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the food. We got the fried oysters and the crab rangoons. We had the fried oysters and the crab rangoons.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,What an amazing place!! The atmosphere is amazing and the food is amazing. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was terrible. I went to go to a couple of friends and I was told it was going
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This isn't Mexican food, so I'm not sure if it's authentic or not, but I'm not a fan.  The food is mediocre at best, and the portions are very small.  The only reason I'd give it a four is because"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Good Greek food at reasonable prices. The food is just ok. The salad bar is tiny and the breadsticks are very small. The service is also pretty bad. I was very impressed with the customer service and the quality of the food.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Stopped our first night here and it was an experience. I will say that the service was pretty good. The food was pretty good, but the food was not great. The creole rice with the shrimp and shrimp in it was a bit salty."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"WINGS OVER PHILLY...

News Flash - We have been to the Burrito King in Chicago, and this one is a close second. The Chicken, Burrito, and Tijuana Burger is definitely the best we have had in the area."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My favorite breakfast place in Tampa. The food is amazing and the staff is always very friendly and accommodating. If you want a nice, relaxed and healthy meal you're in the right place. The food was great. The server was a bit slow."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,This new 'plasticless Delaware' thing that has been around forever. I will be back for the food and the atmosphere. Great job!I am a huge fan of Treme. The food is consistently good and the service is fantastic.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Came just to feed my dog. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"One of the better Cane's in town, with a lot of history.

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty.  I've had the family style and it was good, but nothing special."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Pizza was great.  Wings were really good.  I was so disappointed in the service.  Felt like we were a burden having to be waited on.  Maybe it's because we are not regulars.  I don't like giving bad reviews but to me customer service is so very important.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and cornbread. The meat was tender, and there were many barbecue options. I sampled a few; love a lot of sauce!!! The Mac and cheese was average, there was too much cheese compared to noodles. Overall, a good meal and would return."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I have been taking out or eating in here at least once every other week for four years. Best pizza in Fairmount. The pepperoni and vodka are my favorite. Tried the vodka gnocchi this weekend and it was homemade and delicious. Also, yummy strombolis to feed an army."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Tried the Carmel cinnamon donut this morning 
That has been referred to as Amish crack 
It was very sweet and tasty and very messy 
Would not recommend eating on the go in a car 
Also tried a chocolate with Bavarian cream 
Really didn't care for it 
Really don't see myself going back"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Just had lunch and really enjoyed it!  I ordered the grilled chicken BLT, which was delicious on the brioche bun.  The house salad was a great compliment to the meal.  Would definitely go back and I look forward to try something new!  I am sure it won't disappoint."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place is a little hole in the wall and it's wonderful! The food was authentic, expertly cooked and very flavorful! Inexpensive and an ala cart menu if you're not super hungry. My boyfriend has the steak and it was enormous! The tortillas are legit and are homemade."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Atmosphere: Indian Decor

Service: Service was average, nothing special

Food: Chicken Tikka Masala, Plain Basmati Rice, and Plain Naan. Nothing special. FYI Spicy is pretty spicy almost on the boarder of inedible. 

Cost: Portions and quality seem to match the price

Overall: Would go back if in the area but definitely had better indian food."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Omg, what a gem. 

Slightly outside the city, had some friends take me here. 

Authentic food, really outstanding...

Daily specials 

I had creole catfish, maybe the best I've ever had 

Crab claws were good

Poboys looked good

Stuffed peppers looked good 

Bread was amazing 

Service was top notch...definitely a new favorite when I'm in town"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food was great! Very friendly atmosphere with nice staff!
I highly recommend this place.  
The best chicken parm I have ever had, better than my grandma!
Always ask for the specials, the octopus and  artichokes (appetizer) and the Cowboy steak both under the specials menu are amazing.
Def coming back many more times"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,WOW! I just came back from eating at this place and it was great. Onion Pancake was the best i've ever had. I got the combination egg fu-yon w/e and it was godly. The owner was really nice and friendly. Oh and the giant coi fish was nice to look at too.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Sam's always serves delicious food and plenty of it.  I just finished the lamb gyro platter and cannot eat another thing.  I have ordered carry out twice in the past week and the orders are always ready quickly.  If you like eastern mediterranean food, you will love this place."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,So delicious and affordable!! A true hidden gem of Reno. Many different kinds of sweet and savory buns to choose from as well as fresh breads and boba. All buns are around $1 and truly you can't go wrong with any of them. Great to pick up a bunch for groups too.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This cafe far exceeded our expectations!  Everything was exceptionally fresh and authentic.  Our meals were large for the price, so great value too.  Honestly, this was one of the best meals we have had in awhile, so this cafe will be top of our list for local dining venues."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Light and airy on the deck with happy  background music loud yet not too much so. Loved the clatter of servers. If you want quiet eat inside. 
Caesar crisp salad nice over size then seafood pasta. Attentive staff w: out being overbearing.
Tasty pasta mare able to accommodate low garlic. Will return."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Colleen's was great to work with and had great customer service! I had a special request and they were able to fill my order in plenty of time! I ordered Texas shaped cookies and they turned out ADORABLE! My coworkers loved them. I would definitely recommend Colleen's to anyone needing fun cookies!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food is authentic. The Xiang style chicken was fresh and delicious. I don't think it might be anyone because it has bones, which is common in china. The service is prompt and attentive. Will try out other dishes next time. The restaurant has a quit good selection of authentic Chinese dishes."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The burger was ok but nothing amazing.  The fries were hard and cold.  The cheese sauce was a cold, congealed mess of yellow funk with a crust on top.   I'd be hard pressed to go here again.   Don't worry Five Guys - they aren't a threat."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Great locally owned Bar Bistro, with a great variety of beers, cocktails, and appetizers. Great food and great service. The salad bar is a great choice as well. I had the breakfast burrito which was very good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Just finished lunch. 35 minutes later, the food is still cold. The server was rude. If we had waited for our food to come, we would have left. We had to ask for the manager to come over."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We had a wonderful service here. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The mac and cheese was awesome and the bacon was so fresh. The customer service was great
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Great service, kind staff, good food. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the food. The chicken sandwiches are the best I've had. The salad bar is pretty good as well. The food was great. The server was a bit slow."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've loved everything I've eaten here. The food is just what you'd expect for a local restaurant. I've had the boneless wings, the fried chicken, the ribs, and the chicken salad. Everything is great. The staff is always friendly."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Food & Friends is simply amazing. The food is amazing, the drinks are great, and the staff is so friendly. The food is delicious and the drinks are great. The only thing that I have had that is not good is the coffee."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Very good sushi, great special rolls. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the service. The waitress was not very attentive. The sushi was not fresh and the sushi was cold. We had to ask her to get the check. The sushi was not very"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I ordered this cake a few weeks ago and it was good but not spectacular. I was disappointed. It was not the best I've had and the cake was not the best I've ever had. I would not order this again.I've been going to this
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"For a Brennan restaurant, I would say the food is good but it's not great. I ordered the chicken burger and the fries. The fries were crispy, not crispy. The burger was ok. The chicken burger was not good. The fries were cold."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"All the staff were incredibly friendly and professional. We ordered two pizzas, a salad and a pizza. The pizza was delicious. The salad was crispy, not too greasy and had a nice crisp. The pizza was good, but nothing special."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Really surprised to see the prices on the menu. I got a salad, a side of fries and a cup of fries. I took the salad out of the bag and it was still cold. It was a large salad, no fries."
Restaurants,1.5,CG,they were extremely busy and had to wait an additional 15 minutes to get someone to help us. The other two employees had to get up and leave as well. This place is definitely going to go down in history. The food is really good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Getting more popular as expected, but the food is just ok. The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The fries are thick, not crispy. It's just a thin strip of fries."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Fantastic HUGE tamales!  Closest tamale I've ever had.  Also, the best salsa I've ever had.  The house margaritas are the best I've ever had.  If you like spicy, you might like it"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,My wife and I have been here a few times and we always love it. I order the chicken and waffles and it's so delicious. The chicken is moist and flavorful and it's cooked to perfection. It's a little pricey but it's definitely worth it
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"It was okay, maybe I was a little too picky for my liking, but I was just a little too full. The food was okay, but the service was pretty bad. The waitress was very rude and rushed us to a table."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I don't know how this place has such a long history but it's one of the few places we go to for the best food, drinks and service!I think this place is pretty cool. The staff is very nice and I really enjoyed their customer service."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great restaurant, wish they had some plants to improve the ambiance outside (like Carmel restaurant next door). Wifey got bacon burger for brunch.. (yeah I know), looked good. I got the Floridian omelet with blackberry grits, very tasty! I don't like dry food, so this is a great selection on a hot day!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Just purchased one slice of cake (Southern Style Caramel cake), a slice of cheesecake and one slice of pie. The cake was so dry, the only thing holding it together was the frosting and the pie crust wasn't cooked thoroughly. You better dine in because carry out sadly disappoints and wastes your $$"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Awesome little cafe. I read the reviews and have wanted to come here for some time. The staff was really nice, great service, and good food. The caprese sandwich and the potato salad we're super solid. The outdoor seating is shaded so you can enjoy a nice lunch in the great American west."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Wife and I stopped in for a quick dinner. She had the nachos and a margarita, I had the beef tacos. Both were great. The refried BLACK beans were something different on the nachos and a pleasant surprise. The crispy pork wasn't 'crispy', but was really great. Margarita was strong, but really good."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Absolutely love this place!!  They have Thee Best Pico of any Mexican place around!  My husband loves the Cali Burrito.  The Chili Relleno is a must try.  I always order it as a combo with chicken enchiladas!  Refried beans are very good as well!!  All around Delish!!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This local spot is cute but I won't say it's the cleanest place to eat. Food is good and made to order, which is nice. I don't have a lot to say but it's okay. I support local businesses but would prefer a cleaner environment so takeout will have to do, for now."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If you love a unique Dining experience and like to try multiple dishes during dinner then this place is a MUST eat. The chef / owner is also very visible during dinner and is a nice guy. 

Get the prime rib. Best Au Jus ever. 

I will be back. The food is amazing."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We had the Peacemaker and short rib Po Boy. Both were very delicious. Good portion size. I'd recommend sharing if you want to try different sandwiches because the flavor was great! 

Guy Fiery stamp of approval can be seen on one of the walls. 

Thanks for a good experience here in New Orleans."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"On a little family vacation during COVID can be difficult... we decided to visit Santa Barbara to get out of Ventura for a minute... My girls wanted Italian and we found this place... what a delight, patio seating, friendly and helpful staff, awesome food, we will definitely be back, what an amazing place!!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Service was 5/5.
Food 3.5/5
Ambiance 4/5

I did not understand why most of the food had an Asian twist to it. All of our selected foods had a sweetness to it that I did not particularly like. I was expecting a more modern, light approach to NO food.

All in all, it was a good experience"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Quoted 33 min for my order and was not ready for over an hour. 
They made my order incorrectly, had to go back for correction. No apologies. Food is mediocre for $82.00.
Calzone bland, kids pasta was definitely sitting around before the rest was ready. Meatball parm is horrible. 

I will not be returning."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"So happy Han Dynasty is delivering during the quarantine - we order from them on a regular basis - the dry pepper chicken was cooked to perfection with the perfect crunch and heat - I call it crack chicken because it's that good! Add fried rice, dumplings in chili oil and you're golden."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Surprisingly delicious ive been twice and loved it both times. So did my kids. Its a little expensive for a walk up and order place but the quality is great. I also love the home made juices and shakes! We bought the coffee shake. It was delicious. My burger was a California burger!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We had the taste of New Orleans, it was so yummy! My husband and brother were able to finish their plate, I couldn't. I really wanted to but I was stuffed. The staff was very nice and accommodating. We also had the Cajun koolaid, it too was yummy! We will definitely be back!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Downward spiral... They've destroyed anything interesting about this place one decision at a time. They've removed multiple dishes such as the real crab and artichoke dip, to completely removing their Sunday specials. Each time we geg a server they are timid and lack any knowledge of the menu. Have zero interest coming back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Awesome place, mid-east food doesn't come better then this. Food is delicious. Service is ample, correct and nice.

One star off though as the atmosphere really doesn't represent the mid-east, a bit too much hipster for me (which is fine). What really annoyed is that the place is very loud/noisy (music way too loud)."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came with some friends and it was awesome! I don't think it would be worth driving out of nashville to go here but if you're in Franklin, you should give it a shot! We got some cocktails and the chips and wings. Both were excellent! Give it a shot! you won't regret it!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Best view in St. Louis. Staff is friendly and helpful. I will definitely come back!Very good.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Stopped by here for lunch and it was a very pleasant experience. 

The food was good.  The burrito was a bit small but the flavor was good.  The rice was good and the beans were good.  The tamales were very good"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I'm not impressed with big portions. The food is just ok. The salad bar is tiny and the prices are too high. I will not return. The service is not great.I'm so excited to come here!  I've been coming here for years and
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Five star for the ambience, and the service. We ordered two appetizers, a small plate of the gnocchi and a plate of the ribeye. The gnocchi were large enough to share and were excellent. The ribeye was one of the best"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Went here for lunch today. We had the Ribeye and the Mac & Cheese. The Ribeye was a little too fatty for my liking. The Mac & Cheese was good, but it was just a little too much. The Mac & Cheese had some chunks of"

I had the Chicken Tenderloin, which was a great choice. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the broth was perfect. The noodles were very creamy and"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Wow! Amazing dessert! It was a sweet and sour chocolate cake with a nice crunchy caramelized strawberry. It was delicious! The banana pudding was also fantastic! I think the place is pretty small, but it's not really a large place."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Coming to Iron Hill Brewery, I was hoping to try something new. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

I had the Chicken Bacon Burger and the Ribeye. Both were very good but nothing to write home about. The Bacon Burger was a little dry and the Rib"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Second time sucks just as much. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I am from San Francisco.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I eat at Richie's M-W-F often. The food is good, but not spectacular. I have ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and the waffles had a lot of rice. The chicken was not seasoned at all, it had"

Restaurants,3.5,CG,SoCal transplant to Boise area. We have been to many places in town and this is the first one we have tried.  The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table. If you are going to
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I used to come hear about this place when I was in town. I have been to the other locations before but the food is not worth the trip. I think the place is overrated. The staff is not friendly at all. The food is average and the food
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Service was very good. Perfect location. Parking lot is available on site.  We order a round of margaritas and they were made perfectly. Their shrimp and fish tacos are delicious. It was within walking distance from our stay which made it more convenient. Prices are reasonable for location. I would definitely come back!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is pretty much an average Chinese restaurant with a little more variety.  **I had to edit my review after trying other places and this is the best chinese food I've tired so far. Adding another star. Aside from the food, everyone is very nice and they are very quick with the orders."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Excellent food, and sevice! The salsa is to die for!!

We will make this place a frequent stop every time we visit!!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I took a friend that hates chains to MOD pizza on Wed night. We each had a small pizza and salad. He loved it.

Unlimited toppings and fresh ingredients and a Revision Beer to wash it all down.

Fast too as we were on our way to Nevada Basketball.

I love the drink station. Yummy ice tea."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,This is a nice diner. I went here with my friend after a run so we were starving. The omelette was so big that I couldn't even finish it. The coffee was pretty decent and the staff was very nice. It was a good cozy post-run place to stop. I really like non-scary diners.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The Shrimp Platter was so good. I had them cook my Oysters extra hard and everything was seasoned to perfection. Our waiter Colin was super sweet and knowledgeable. The host Iseal was super too.  We well definitely be back when back in NOLA. We also love how the tables are 6 feet apart...
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My son and I visited the old school pub and it was a nice place within walking distance from our hotel. Great beer and pretzels.  They don't serve food, but the people were nice and the beer selection was average. I will go back next trip to see the Red's beat the Phillies!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Best Bagels in town. My favorite is onion bagel with their coffee. Prices cannot be more reasonable. Place is clean, staff is friendly. 
Multiple flavors all are great.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Fun little place in old town with a very varied menu. Despite looking busy for Saturday brunch they seated us fast and the service was friendly,  efficient and genuinely helpful.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I really wanted to love Andrade's. . .but I can't.  

The Good - really, nice creative menu. Lot of options. Friendly service.

Not So Good - Salsa bar had plastic cups which made the restaurant feel like a fast good joint.

Bad - No draft beer, No tequilla, No liquor license.

My search continues. . .."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Great (3-meat-cuts) burger, (surprise-ingredient-dusted) sweet potato fries, and service by ""Mike G."" He really made a good meal much more special, with his warm personality and attentive hospitality. I told this to a manager who (had done the right thing, because he) had jumped in to run food to tables, at a busy time."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Good selection on menu. $100 for 3 to eat and expierence the place. Waiter not friendlybut very proficient. Food was well executed and tasted excellent. Good place to take someoneyou want to impress with food and haughty waiters but the decor was a step above a diner. Luckily the darkness hides alot of this.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The Reef was recommended to us after eating at Brickyard. We wanted some live music and good cocktails, and we were not disappointed. The bartenders were great, especially Rachel. She was very knowledgeable and friendly. The Brickyard and Reef made for a wonderful evening for me and my wife. We definitely recommend this place!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Orange marmalade is good.  Cheese grits are wonderful. Eggs done properly as ordered. Bacon really crispy so if you like it chewy ask them to cook less than usual.  Homemade corn beef hash was good as well.  Perfect diner experience with okay food.  Sit outside if the weather is right.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"usually very pleased with this restaurant! I get the fire and caterpillar rolls and almost always love them!
This past Friday, 11/27, I got food poisoning from one of those two rolls, or the crab Rangoon. So despite them usually being good, I will now be wary and inspect the rolls before I eat them."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"This place is by far the worst place to order pizza from. I would avoid it at all cost. My delivery took 2 hours!!! I called to ask what happened and got a very nonchalant, almost uninterested response. I am no longer getting pizza from this place. I'd rather go to zestos or Roman's"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Love this place. The atmosphere is nice and the food is good. The best thing about this place is the drinks. The bartender is very knowledgeable and friendly. I love that it's a little smaller than other places in the area.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection. It was served on a bed of rice and with a side"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely come back!Very good. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I wasn't too sold on this place, as it seemed like a lot of the people were just really unhappy with the food. I got the fried chicken, which was pretty good, but I don't think it was really good enough to warrant a 5 star review."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I ordered online and gave it to the hostess. I asked her for a name and she said she would call the hostess, but that she would not call me. I then asked her to call me. She did call me, and told me I had to call"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,This WaWa usually stresses me out. The food is good but it's also a small place and we've had some very bad experiences. I can't say I'll be back.I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I literally repeated my order and it was ready when I got home. When I got home, the chicken was not the same. The fries were crispy, and the bun was cold. The chicken was tough and not fresh. I will not be returning."

If you're looking for something different for date night or something a step up for a family dinner, I think you will really love this place."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Um it was okay. Lamb was fatty. Salads were overdressed.  Peach on salad was crunchy not what I expect a peach to be. Flat iron steak was too salty.  Common issue with restaurants with too much salt. Desserts were so-so.  Pleasant experience but a bit overwrought.   Not worth the money.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We love this place! It's not the best Greek we've had but it is still very delicious​. The staff is always friendly and attentive making us feel right at home. When the weather is just right, they open up their huge window to the dining​ room bringing the nice weather indoors. I definitely​ recommend Pappoule's!."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"WoW! I stopped in for lunch today and was so happy I did. Great food and I really liked the vibe of this place. I rarely give 5 stars but I have to say, for the money and the wonderful Italian Salsiccia Po-Boy I had, 5 stars all the way!!
I want to go back tomorrow!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Sligo offers an incredible happy hour! Cheap apps and beer.  Their service is quick, professional, and friendly. They also play great music. It's a less crowded than the rest of the bars in media during happy hour so There's always a spot open to sit. I love sligo! Only real Irish bar in media."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I love coming here because they have some great happy hour specials! Located on Delmar in the Loop, parking can sometimes be tricky around this area! If you're looking for some good sushi, try coming on a Wednesday night when their regular and special rolls are discounted nicely! Quick turnaround for food and efficient service"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"First time here, I tried the Papaya salad extra hot, it was fantastic!! Hand crafted all freshly cut, amazing sauce and taste & really spicy, a good portion size as well, I wish there was more than a single shrimp though, but that one shrimp was amazing, I'll definitely be back to try more dishes."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Clear sky draught Haus 
Food is good 60% of the time.
By far the Biggest problem at ClearSky Draught Haus is the manager Jason who is the most 
Unprofessional, non-polished manager we have ever dealt with in the restaurant business. We WILL NOT order from this Clear sky again.

The other two Clear Sky locations are awesome"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,a donut and 2 slider cost me 15 dollars. the sliders cost 4 dollars each and i took 1 bite per slider to finish it. Please stick with making only donuts. your food isn't special. nothing that made me want to order again. it actually made me not want to go see you guys again.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was not expecting this place to be so good! The chicken and waffles were restaurant & southern quality. This was better than chicken and waffles that I've had in Mississippi and Louisiana! Great for the price ($9) and less than a 2 minute wait. Great service and atmosphere, especially for a fast food joint!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"So good!   Everything we ordered was super fresh.  
The veggie bowl was super delish!   The lobster roll was to die for!   The lobster/crab grilled cheese was my absolute favorite!   My daughter loved the salmon bowl.   In other words, go there if you like seafood."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great beer, food and service! Only $3.50 for pints on many of their beers. Me and my husband shared the fried zucchini and the lighter version of fish and chips minus the chips and added the cucumber salad. Tried to keep light so we could have dinner later. We will come again when in Reno."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I ordered a fresh fruit cake and it was a hit at our Christmas party! It is an Asian fruit cake made with sponge cake, fresh fruit and whipped cream. It was not too sweet like American cakes but tasted perfect. 

The buns are always good too try the bbq pork buns or teriyaki chicken!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Good food, good service. I ain't gonna lie and say it's the best pizza ever, but it is pretty good. When your experiencing pizza chain fatigue and your not sure if something different is worth it, this is totally worth it. Reminds me of some of my old east side favorites like classic Just Pizza"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great food, however, they just can't get simple orders straight. Instructions were very clear but they just can't get it. Have had problems with numerous orders and last night's order finally did it. Not ordering from them again. Work too hard to spend money for something that isn't what I want and I won't eat."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The food here is absolutely delicious! I love the oxtails and with rice and peas. Cabbage and cornbread is unbelievable! It can be a little pricey and the line can be wrapped around the restaurant. But I'm willing to stand in the line as I have never been disappointed with my food or the service.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Wow.... Read all the other reviews and if I wasn't staying at the Courtyard Marriott which is right next door, I might not have tried it. So glad I did. Sat at the outside covered bar and Collin the bartender  was exceptionally friendly.
Started with the cheesesteak rolls and they were awesome.
Pizza was just ok."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The wait was not long, and the food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and great. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fry was overcooked. My husband had the shrimp and"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Out of all the various places I've been to in Nashville, I'd give this place one star.  The food is mediocre, but the service is extremely slow.  I've been to many other places and this place is a bit better.  This is a great place"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Drago's is alway a top notch place, with a great variety of Italian dishes, and a pretty good selection of wine. The food is solid and the drinks are tasty. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Amazing Mexican food with a nice atmosphere and an awesome menu.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was terrible. I went to go to a couple of friends and I was told it was going to be a 30 minute"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Very good food. I ordered the crab and onion soup which was a nice amount of crab and onion. My husband had the chicken tenders which he said were very tasty. The only thing that we didn't like was the outside of the tenders. My husband had the shrimp

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Very nifty compared to your typical chain restaurants. 

We were seated in the upstairs dining room which was not very open. The table that we were seated in was a very large table with a table in the middle. We were seated near the fireplace which was a nice touch"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place was unique taste and presentation, the food was good but not spectacular. I would recommend. I had the burrito and a friend had the chicken enchilada. The burrito was huge and the chicken enchilada was very good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Tried this place because it was on the way to a hotel in Reno, NV. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was good but the waffles were a little dry. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and texture of the chicken."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,I'm being generous giving this place a two since I won't go back again. The waiter sat myself and a friend under a dripping vent. Switched tables. The food was so mediocre bland and tasteless. My friends quiche looked like hard as a rock pastry (no nicely flaking) and not hot. Much better options in Dunedin
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Great service... Our hostess was the best part of the visit. An extra star for the quality of fish and seafood here but the food was very poor in Flavors n texture!  All I could taste was rice from sushi to hand rolls which masked the beautiful seafood. And it wasn't cheap by any means.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,This place has some really good food and the milkshakes are amazing as well! And it's so good to see normal people working there and treating you like normal human beings. My family and I ate there this weekend and were completely taken back by actual customer service and smiling faces! We will be back again.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place is great! I have only been a handful of times, but I have never been disappointed. The sandwiches are amazing, the soups are fantastic, and the service is always outstanding. If you come during the week around lunchtime expect a line. They will serve you fast, but seating might be hard to come by."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We eat here several times a week....food is always hot and excellently prepared.All day happy hour is a plus and the servers are very good.
Outside bartenders are the best around,know everybody by name and are very personable.Early menu has plenty of choices.Outside seating area is also larger than average with segregated smoking area which we appreciate."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food is good but they take forever to get it out to you. I wouldn't recommend going here unless you are ready to sit down and eat. 
I've been sitting in the drive through now for 20 minutes and my food still hasn't come out to me yet.. 
Honestly what's he point of a drive through?"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I keep giving this coffee shop a chance because I'm in the area quite a bit. But the coffee and teas are horrible tasting. It tastes burned! Today I ordered a chai tea latte and had to throw it out after 3 sips because it tasted terrible. Ive learned my lesson, no more ordering drinks here."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is not authentic Mexican food! First of all it's over priced paid 6.00 for a ""kids meal"" that only included one chicken taco, no sides just ONE TACO!  Also the food is absolutely salty. Not to mention the refried beans are canned. Do not recommend this place unless you like over priced salty food."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"It's been a long year since last enjoying Arabella's great food and service. They have added a delightful outdoor area right next door - and it's a success! The food is better than ever, and the service is great too. Thank heavens - real Italian food with handmade pasta at reasonable prices."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"If you are happen to be at West County Mall, make sure you stop by at Mandalay Asian Cuisine.

Friendly service and reasonable price!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Been here a few times a real hole in the wall authentic Mexican place!! Love the food. A very do it yourself kinda place with football(soccer) on TV.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We come straight from the airport to have breakfast. It's a small town joint that just knows how to make a good, solid breakfast. My wife loves the biscuits and gravy and I love the meat lovers omelette. They have a great sausage. Good prices and a great view of the water if you eat outside."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The owner of this bar supports his community and staff immensely. He caters public events at his own cost, puts every penny back into the bar to constantly keep it updated, and has paid for employees doctor, dental, and rental bills in times of need. No one could ask for a better pillar of the community."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,My family of 5 just left here and had a great time. Aaryn our server was phenomenal and went out of her way to help us with our little ones.

Restaurants,2.0,OR,Rude fricken host!!!!  We waited at the front  and no one greeted us. We sat ourself and the host had the audacity to walk over to us to try to correct us about sitting ourselves. We left !!! Y'all lucky I did not snap. They need to learn about customer service and good manners.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Katie, your restaurant is in STL, not NY.  Your prices are unreasonable.  $15 for pasta with red sauce that is the size of an appetizer plate?  I don't think so.  You may have a creative menu and a hip vibe but those prices just don't work here.  This is the midwest honey."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We walked a mile from our hotel to Biscuit Love and we're so glad we did. We sat at the counter and Jo did a wonderful job for us. She is the epitome of Southern hospitality. If you get the chance, make the effort to stop by for great food and great service. You won't be disappointed."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Bellyed up to the bar. Waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged. I was asked, finally, ""Drink menu or full menu "", to which I replied, full menu. Waited 5 more minutes, hoping I would at least be asked what would would you like to drink... crickets. Walked out. For an out of town traveler, bad first impression."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The atmosphere, selection, and patrons are diverse and great.  Its the perfect place to spend a cold Saturday: tucked into a leather chair or sofa, Scotch and cigar in hand, relaxing with other cigar lovers while enjoying the ebb and flow of conversation topics and cigar smoke.

Get here, pick a stick, find a chair, and enjoy!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Great hidden lunch spot!  Yes, lots of 50+ ladies, but if you're not intimidated by that you love the food. I had a wonderful Asparagus Melt and glorious Gooey Butter Brownie!  I love that it was real Gooey butter cake stacked on a rich brownie rather than an attempt to mingle them together."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,This is the second time I have visited this place. specifically the quaint bar area. Always received great service when I went. This particular visit I had a great time at the bar because of Jon. I love his humor and he made my visit to the bar one of the highlights of my day.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I was super excited for the jazz brunch buffet, however the band didn't play much, which I was a bit disappointed about. That being said, the buffet has pretty much everything you'd want in a buffet. And since we were visiting New Orleans, we wanted to try the local cuisine, which this definitely allowed us to do!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Chipotle burrito is out of this world, wife loves the al pastor tacos and Tinga chicken as well. Free margs (nice touch def not amazing tho) and excellent prices.... chips quac, homemade table salsas, burrito, 2 supreme tacos and 4 margs for under $20! And did I mention the food is even more amazing than the price?"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Outstanding!!  Third visit to Maggiano's and I must say they never  disappoint.  My girlfriend and I had the pleasure to meet Chef Adam Hall this evening,  very nice man,  made us feel welcome and comfortable just like family.  Staff was wonderful, food was wonderful.  

Thanks again Chef Hall

Matt & Amanda"
Restaurants,2.0,OR,I like to begin with I order the king cake friday January 10th. I live in georgia and the weather seems not to help. On Tuesday the 14 i received my tracking number. January 16th at 2:30 i received my king cake. The taste was disgusting and the color was off. I rather pay for overnight shipping.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Love this place. Stop in and grab a drink, Pig Mac, muffaletta and some swag. Food is terrific and service friendly.  It is a short walk away from the drunks in the Quarter.  Again with the Yelp insisting on writing s book about a great place.  Gimme a break, I'm not a food blogger."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"What a total surprise this place was.  Really good food and great prices!  It was quite full of Senior Citizens but hey no problem with that, I'll be one soon enough.  To find a place like this, at a casino, with great food AND great prices was a real surprise.  We'll be back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Barclay Prime never disappoints. The 18 oz prime rib and my wife and daughters filets were cooked perfectly. The popovers are one of a kind and the side dishes are really tasty. My favorite was the truffle Mac and cheese. If you go be prepared to drop a bundle as it is truly a special occasion destination.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Have seen this place many times and finally stopped in. I believe I confuse them with my order, I'm picky and then specifically asked for no veggies when I probably should have. They remade my sandwich no issues and were very nice. Sandwich was really good especially for the fairly reasonable price. Will be stopping by more"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Been to this place couple times, nice. Cute Little store up front, the food is Great!! Has southern dishes, like biscuits , meatloaf, to apple dumplings. Their breakfast is fabulous!! Great comfort foods, I went there with girlfriend of mine, had dessert!! OMG Berry compote al-la mode. Wow. Can't go there too often, kill my regimen."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"So good! You wouldn't know it by the fact that you're in a hurry, but this place is so so. The food is delicious and the staff is so nice. The only thing that is disappointing is that the wait can get a little long."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My fiancé and I are both in the area and decided to stop by for a drink and some time to read the menu. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the fish and chips, which were very good. The food was also very"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Stumbled across this gem while visiting New Orleans. We decided to try it for the first time and we were so impressed. The food was delicious and the service was great. The only thing that we didn't like was that the wait was extremely long. This was our first time coming here
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I am visiting Philly and this place is the best. I will be back for sure!The best fried chicken in the area. The fries are crispy, and the chicken is cooked to perfection. The fried pickles are good too.I've been going to this place for almost 3 years"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Give everyone working here today, thank you, thank you. I will be back for sure!I've been coming here for years. The food is always fresh and tasty. The staff is always friendly and attentive. It's a great place for a quick lunch or dinner."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I had ordered Saag paneer and it was just ok. I will say that the naan was good. The saag was very dry. The paneer was okay. The curry was ok. The naan was not good. The curry had some chunks of chicken and the sauce
Restaurants,4.5,CG,They have amazing cupcakes I've had at least once. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to get your coffee and then have a drink you can bring it to your table. They have a good selection of coffee and tea.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"All three of us felt that it was an overpriced item. 

The food was good.  The drinks were decent, but the food was not worth the price.  We had the fried chicken and the shrimp and grits.  The fried chicken was very good. "
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I have really been loving this place and the food is good. 

The only thing is that I am not a big fan of the sushi, and the sushi is very small. 

The only thing that I would change is to have some kind of happy hour for the"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We were in NOLA to visit my family and we decided to try this place out. We ordered the gnocchi, the Chicken parm and the chicken sandwiches. Everything was very good. We also had the bread pudding. I would highly recommend.This was our first time coming"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Wow... I wish every pizza place had the quality and quality of its own!  I was just blown away by the quality of the food.  The salad was tasty and the pizza was delicious.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.This is one of my favorite places for
Restaurants,4.5,CG,The atmosphere is great during happy hour and the food is good. The only downfall is that the service is a bit slow. The server was not attentive at all and was just a little overwhelmed. I would recommend this place and will be back.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Best Tacos ever! I ordered the Chimichanga and it was amazing. The chimichanga was cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of heat. The chimichanga was great as well. I highly recommend this place. We went to this restaurant for the first time today.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Their tacos here are so good. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the service is so slow.  The place is small and is pretty small, so it's not that it's bad, but it's not a place I would go out of my way to go to"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Great atmosphere and the food was amazing!  We ordered the shrimp and grits and the crawfish and grits. The shrimp and grits were seasoned just right and were large enough to share. The crawfish and grits were tender and moist.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Usually great service with mostly friendly waitresses. The food is decent DINER food. My gripe is how absolutely over priced this place is especially for the amount of food you get. They are especially super chinzy on the amount of breakfast potatoes they give. What you're getting is over priced diner food. I'd rate higher with different pricing.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This is definitely my new favorite place to eat at. Everything is new, chic, and clean. The vibe is upbeat Italian inspired by Sophia Loren. The food was amazing. I honestly can't say which is best but I loved the kale salad the bucatini and the steak was out of this world delicious! It's a must try spot."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Delicious food (can't go wrong with anything), amazing service especially the bartenders (Gabriel, Patrick) who waited on our party.  They had candid recommendations and went beyond the call of their duty to ensure we all had a delightful experience.

Rec'd a birthday cake shot as a welcome surprise.  

Stop by and say hello to Gabriel and Patrick."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Sooooooooo pissed. I was with a large group of people who were scheduled to show up at 9:30 on a friday night. It 2as a catered order, but they closed the kitchen at 9pm on a Friday night. Those wgo didn not like/eat the awful catered food had no other choices because they had already closed the kitchen."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Better service, better food. Good time on the patio. This is an upgraded review from my previous one. Our food was fresh and hot. Chips and salsa plentiful and the wait staff was attentive. Even though I arrived before my friend they were able to seat me first. 

Hopefully Hacienda continues to improve back to its original splendor."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The happy hour is pretty decent five dollar wine is drinkable and the bacon wrapped dates are divine. Make sure you leave room for dessert as the chocolate eclairs absolutely out of this world. The waitstaff gets five stars they really make the experience great they all seem quite lively and dedicated to the restaurant rare to find.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Awful! Waited 40 minutes, asked for refund because we could not wait any longer, still charged me for drinks. No accountability,  poor service,  highly priced subpar food. Paid $40 for a clazone and 3 drinks... 

Pizza tasked nothing like new York pizza. Save your money and go to hungry Howie or papa johns, much better pizza."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Always high quality food. We have always done all you can eat and we have now tried all of the AYCE items on the menu and have never been disappointed. Service is usually pretty good. I have had a couple servers at this location that make me feel like an inconvenience, otherwise this place would have 5 stars."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is a popular restaurant for locals and tourists. Love the Mussels Diablo appetizer. I usually order it as my meal. Everything I have had here is very good. Coconut shrimp, Mahi, Salmon, crab legs are all excellent. They also have the best Grouper Reuben I have ever had.

This restaurant has reasonable prices which keeps locals coming back!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We tried this place for the first time.  We ordered from the carry out menu and had the smoked sausage, brisket and turkey with the corn casserole. Everything was delicious. All the meat was juicy and really didn't need any sauce, but we liked the sweet sauce a lot.  We will definitely be back for more."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We ordered take out from here and the person whom answered the phone was on point. He was clear to understand. Our food was ready In 20minutes and was delicious.

We had the vegetable fried rice, walnut shrimp, spring rolls and Mongolian chicken. These were all really good no complaints!

We want to dine in soon and try new dishes"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Beer selection that is out of this world! The food was a little disappointing. I had the beef gyro which I wasn't able to finish due to a peculiar taste that I am unable to accurately describe. My husband had the salmon salad and was pleased with it. Would go again to try something else on the menu.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Stopped on for the 2nd time for lunch. Service was prompt and friendly. We had the club sandwich and the corned beef sandwich. Both were excellent. Cooked perfectly and made with quality ingredients. My wife had onion rings with her sandwich and they were the awesome. We really enjoy eating at Tiffany's and would recommend it to all.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Showed up just a tad too late to eat outside but all and all the food was great as well as the service! Got my 15% military discount and. $99 Shock top. Had the grouper sandwich, HOLD THE CHEESE. Even the cole slaw was amazing! Looking forward to tonight. Stone crab claws were yummy but very pricey @$24."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Setting: gorgeous! In an old church that has been refurbished. Beautiful wood accents and open & airy, yet warm, dark & intimate. Great for a cute dinner with Bae or friends. 

Service: A+. Our server was very nice and attentive. 

Food: seriously good! Traditional southern/NOLA cuisine and great presentation. 

I'm happy to return the next time I'm visiting."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'm originally from Mexico and I can tell you 100% that this IS what tacos should be like!! This is not your typical Tex-Mex restaurant. This is what you would eat if you went for Tacos in any city anywhere in Mexico. My favorite are the Tacos al Pastor, Monje and Gringa...but really anything else is really good."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is one of my favorite places in the area. I always get the cheese steak and the fries. The service is always great, and the food is consistently great. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are hungry, you might have to wait"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Best service on Main Street. Staff is friendly and helpful. I will definitely come back!Very good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The mashed potatoes were very good.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Husband & I come here often & the food is amazing.  We love the variety of toppings & the service is always great.   The salad bar is huge & it's nice to have a little variety in the salad bar.  If you're looking for something different than
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Perfect casual dining experience. Super friendly staff and the food is good. Also, the best thing about this place is the unique and creative beers. 

I think this place is going to be a regular stop for us. I would recommend it for a special occasion or just a date night"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Delicious Thai. curry is great and the flavors are just as good. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food is good but the service is terrible. I go here with a group of friends and they have a very limited menu.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Got a few sushi rolls, and they were all very good. 

The reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good, the service was good, and the sushi was good. 

The only reason I gave them two stars is because the service was not"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,This was always go to for me and my family. I always love this place! I just wish they had more seating. I wish they had more seating if there was a lot more seating. They had a few open seating tables which was nice. My brother always gets the chicken sandwich with no
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"4 stars because I felt that it was a little bit too much. The food was good. The burrito was a bit small but the flavor was good. The rice was good. It was good size, but it was not very filling."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Food was very dry, they had an unpleasant odor to them. The cheese steak was pretty good. The flavor was spot on. The salad was okay. I would definitely go back. It was good enough to keep me from going back to this place."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Absolutely amazing service from Corey, the owner, and the entire staff. 

The food is absolutely delicious and the drinks are fabulous. 

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. I highly recommend you try it!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,A quaint local Italian restaurant that has been around forever. I visited on a Sunday morning and the place was packed. The place was packed and the staff was friendly. The food was delicious. The bread pudding was amazing. I would come back for the service and food.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I really enjoyed dinner here. We had the crab cakes which were a nice size for the price and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was crispy and seasoned just right. The dish was cooked perfectly and the bread was good.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were very good. "
Restaurants,4.5,CG,So delicious!! None other like it. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the wait time. We waited over an hour for our food and then the manager came to take our order. She came back and said we need to go get it. I said ok and she brought us the
Restaurants,2.0,CG,Can't leave zero stars but this place is the best. I will be going back!Very good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The mashed potatoes were very good.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Amazing Food.  Had the lobster with Bow Tie Pasta and Beef Carpaccio appetizer. What might be better is the cocktails. Best Manhattan I have had in a while. My wife had the sour cherry martini where they make their own sour cherries.
Wait staff as sharp and attentive.(Jack). I bit of a know it all, but I like that."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"They have a great deal for 3 rolls $11.75 and each roll has 8 pieces. Very small restaurant with two actual tables and then sushi bar seating. Very quick and efficient sushi chefs that are actually Asian (which is a plus). I shared the fried sweet potato, salmon, eel, and shrimp tempura rolls which were all simple and good."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place is great for the scenery, not so great for the food.  I have been there a few times and cannot recall a good meal that I have had there, all of the food seems very plain.  I highly recommend going there to get a drink and hanging out, but leave and go eat somewhere else."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,We were thoroughly impressed with our polite and helpful server. Not being very familiar with Indian cuisine he took the time to explain the dishes and asked our likes and dislikes directing us to two incredible dishes. We also indulged in a tasty dessert. For the amount of food the price was very reasonable. We will most certainly return.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Delicious danish, chocolate covered pretzels, donuts and rolls!  

We've been going to Deluxe for a good 20 years - mainly for their rolls for big parties.  They never disappoint and in fact, guests usually compliment & ask about the rolls.

They have very good pricing and the staff are friendly to boot.

I'm happy for this little Runnemede gem."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Great salad!  Love their warm chips and salsa.  Could eat the chips plain.   We also ordered the duck confit dish- this was pretty small and served with a lot of fried potatoes (although the mole was delicious).  I will order the salad again with shrimp and another blood orange marg and skip the confit.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Pros: cheap happy hour prices, BEER!, close enough to work that I can cartwheel there

Con: The ceiling dripped on me. I changed my location, and it dripped on me there too. Call me old fashioned, but no matter how much cheap beer an establishment throws in front of you, they should still strive to minimize their ceiling dripability factor."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Stopped in today for a quick bite after wedding dress fitting. Since 2 people are vegan/ vegetarian , we thought that we would give it a try. We had Buffalo Cauliflower Bites , Pancakes , Kale salad and Bagel with lox. Oh yeah , a side of Brussels sprouts. Everything was terrific."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"During these times where it's hard to find Hibachi, I was so glad we found a place for my birthday dinner. Our server was on top of everything. She was very safe and wore a mask. Our chef was great, entertaining and introduced us to spicy rice. (Rice with chili sauce) We enjoyed our meals and will be back!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Beautiful building...that's where it ends
Salad bar is nasty, bagged goods at
Best. They give you the very very cheapest plastic ware possible . You know the kind that bends in lettuce. You pick up your pizza at the counter , hot hot tray and
You have to grab napkins to prevent burns. Salad and small pizza $36.00 for 2
Never going back"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had takeout from Marathon.

Meatloaf was pretty tasty.  Solid.

Turkey plate was hard to eat.  Actually, I didn't want any more after trying a bite.  Turkey was overcooked and dry.  Stuffing was overly salty.  Maybe the turkey didn't travel well for takeout, although overcooked is still overcooked whenever you serve it.

Somewhere between 2 & 3 stars."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Love Wendy's chili. Anytime I have a craving for chili I know I can always count on Wendy's!  Dipping by the chicken nuggets in the chili is also quite delicious . 

I've never had an issue with this Wendy's. Seems to be kept a little cleaner than other franchise locations but still not the cleanest. Staff is friendly."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Disappointing. I was looking forward to the Miso Sake Sea Bass but the fish had no hint of miso or sake in/on it. Served dry with no sauce, the jasmine rice was also dry, flavorless and cold. A beautiful restaurant with nice ambiance, but the food is lacking flavor. So for the price I definitely would not come back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Nammura $3.50 each yesterday I ordered one, today, 2. You see where we're headed...it's delicious kicks our American blondie brownies to the curb. I also loved the combination kebab and salad and all the lovely pita they give in a bag. 
I've tried the foul, their fries, and the spinach pie 

I'll stick to the desert and the salad."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I previously rated this restaurant a 2 star because of the service. The owner and management team reached out to me to discuss the issues. They showed a lot of integrity in making the situation right, they went above and beyond. The service now matches the quality of their food."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,I stopped in for a quick lunch while my phone was being repaired at the Apple store. The hostess was extremely polite and sat me in the bar. The service was outstanding! My server was Monique and she made sure I had everything I needed. She was very polite and made me feel like a valued customer.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,This was one of those places where you just feel like you're back in a frozen version of the other two locations. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was that the staff was extremely rude. I was very impressed.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Such a cute location! We had an amazing time! We will definitely be back!Nice atmosphere and we sat outside.  The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty.  Would definitely recommend.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Came on a Saturday for brunch. The hostess was very rude and didn't seem to care. We waited for about 15 minutes for our server to come out. After about 20 minutes we asked for a menu and were told it would take about 15 minutes. After that we had to wait another
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"If you're idea of a good place to go, try this place. If you're a regular, go for the burrito. The burrito is huge and tasty. The staff is nice and the food is great. The only negative thing about this place is that it's very expensive."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I've come here multiple times and have never been disappointed. I always love the cheese steak and the fries. If you want a nice, solid dinner, this is the place to go. The service is great and the food is amazing. If you are looking for a good meal and not a huge"

Restaurants,2.0,CG,This was our first time here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this
Restaurants,3.5,CG,This place is slow. Workers are always running around and making sure everyone is happy. I order the chicken and waffles. The chicken is dry and the waffles are greasy. The chicken is not fried and the waffles are greasy. If I wanted to eat here again I would go
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Breakfast stop is a good idea. The food is good but it's also a little pricey. The prices are not the best but the food is worth the price.This place is amazing!  The staff is so friendly and the food is absolutely delicious!  The food was brought out quickly and
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This is one of our go to restaurants. We usually get the chicken salad, the shrimp and grits, and the fries. The fries are crispy, seasoned, and great. The chicken salad is a little smaller than the grouper sandwich. The shrimp and grits are good, but not a"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This was hands-down one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I was pretty full so I had the boneless wings. The sauce was very tasty. The sauce was thick and flavorful. The wings were good size, they were tender and moist."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"If you're a pizza lover, go here, you won't be disappointed.The food was delicious and we had a great time! The staff was very friendly and we got to take pictures and make it a fun experience. Definitely a must visit for anyone visiting Reno!I've been coming here for"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Best fried chicken in the city. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the fries were so small. The chicken was a bit dry, but not bad. I would definitely go back. The best in the city. The food is great and the service is great."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Nothing more than a newer, more professional establishment, which is a shame because I'd been wanting to go back. The food was delicious and the service was great. I would definitely go back. It's a shame that they can't do better. It was a great experience."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Sits  like a hip-ass, old school diner.  I will admit that I have been there twice since I was a kid.  I have never had a bad experience.  The food is always good and the service is always great.  If you are looking for a good diner"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"For those looking for a no frills breakfast/lunch spot, this place will not disappoint. Or perhaps it will. Either way it's worth a shot and a few bites. Cafe con leche is always on point. Any of the sandwiches are a must have if you can't decide. Service is not consistent which is why I took they earned 4 stars."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Best coffee (I'm not kidding) I've ever had!! Came
Into Nashville during the hottest month and wanted a iced coffee waiting for my family to finish their salon trip. Absolutely delicious. Don't even remember what I got...I think it was just a sweetened iced coffee but I'd drive the 10 hours from Detroit just for this drink..well and the Hot Chicken"
Restaurants,1.5,OR,They are always forgetting something or messing up my order.  It not like I order something different from the menu. Then when I say something the look upset like it's my fault. The customer service is horrible. That's why even though I love McDonald's I rather go to the Burger king across the street! They gave great customer service.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Very good oyster poboy. I had the crab cake Blt special and it was ok. Great fries, delicious chocolate crepe and my son loved his Monte Cristo. Try the Soule Cocktail, such a treat!
Kids enjoyed their Nutella crepe, and in typical NOLA fashion a jazz band paraded through the building and out the front door during our meal."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great outside seating right on the marina.  Small but nice bar.  Great people watching and fun to see the charter boats come in and lay their catch on the dock.  The Salt Cracker will fry, blacken, or cajun season fish you catch and fillet! That is super cool!  And they serve it with fries and coleslaw."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This past weekend, we hosted our son's rehearsal dinner at Jacks London Grill!  Peter, Julie and the staff made every accommodation to make our party a success.  We had a beautiful patio venue, excellent service and the food was outstanding! It was magical. I recommend anyone needing a place to gather family and friends to go to Jacks!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,No oxtails!! And they serve the jerk chicken sauce on the side in a small container it's not even enough to cover the quarter of chicken they give you..... The mac and cheese was tasteless... I hate to say it but Hagerstown has better jerk and oxtails than this place I had higher expectations.....2 stars because the staff were nice.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Been back here a few times but I wanted Bún bo hue and I went there and again as usual the soup was delicious. The wait staff is awesome and they even have a new guy in there that is knowledgeable and very attentive. Definitely one of my top Vietnamese places hidden away way up in Zephyrhills away from Tampa
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The Pad Thai overall was good. The color was different than what I'm used to, but the tofu was prepared well and spice level was great. The Tom Kha Soup was horrible and just needed to be tossed. I'm hoping their tag line as being the best Thai in Spring Hill is misleading and I'll be looking for another option."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The service here was HORRIBLE I wouldn't recommend anybody to go there, our waiter named ceyanni was rude and messed up our check twice, she didn't check on our table & also walked away from us while we were talking to her. Overall the food was dry and burnt and the display of the food was sloppy. Don't eat here."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,The place was hopping...seating was a premium. Everything was clean and people were friendly until they lost my order. Waited 20 minutes for an order to come. Ugh! Food was cold...all I tasted in the soup was salt and the sandwich was just a glob of melted cheese with a little slice of turkey. Nothing to see here... Moving on.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had my taco cravings since last week. If I want one, I always come here. I always order 4 soft tacos, Carne Asada with Fresa drink (Strawberry water) on the side. Didn't had the chance to take a picture as I munched them all away! Hahaha. Came here again and had the same order plus their cheese and chicken quesadilla."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Ordered delivery on a Saturday.  Food came fast and hot! The burrito weighed probably 5 lbs.  it was so big and very good!  The chips and salsa came with verde salsa which was surprising but good.  Onion rings come with a Texas medal sauce that complimented them very well.  Would definitely order from here again!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,I went in to have a bibimbap. It was good. The service is non-existent (they literally give you a sport water bottle full of water to refill you own glass) and the portion quite small (I'm sure it's the right amount of food you should eat) for paying 15.00 with tip. Expensive for what it is but still good food.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Love the place.  First five star I handed out because I enjoyed both the food and the service.  This is a casual dining restaurant so the rating is a comparative rating to other casual dining restaurants.  I think I burned my tongue while I was eating and I kept on yamming so yea, I enjoyed the food."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I went here for dinner last night and the food was good.  The waitress was nice and we sat down at the bar.  We ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious.  We also ordered the smoked turkey burger and it was great.  I ordered the smoked wings and it was
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Maybe it's because I am a meat eater. But I've also eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants. 

If you are looking for some Chinese food, this is the place to go. I have been here twice in the last 2 weeks. I always get the spring rolls with pork."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Stopped by Spyglass after work, and it was an awesome experience.

We were seated promptly, and the service was very attentive. Our server, Sara, was fantastic. She was so nice, and made sure we were taken care of. We ordered the gyro, which was delicious."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Sides are typically great, but this place is the best. I will say that the best part of the meal is the burrito. The burrito is huge and tasty. The sauce is soo good. The only thing I wish they would change is if they had some sort of sauce on the"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I have been to this location a couple of times and I will say that the food is pretty good.  The burrito I got was good but the flavor was not great.  The chicken was okay and the burrito I got was a little dry.  I ordered the chorizo burrito
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Oh yum! The food here is always amazing. We love the cold weather, the variety of beers, and the music. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is fun. I love that it's a little smaller than other places in the area. This was our first time coming here."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,We visited on a Wednesday afternoon. The hostess was very friendly and helpful. She recommended the tapas so we had a seat. We ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffles were amazing. The waffles were very rich and flavorful. The chicken was a bit
Restaurants,5.0,CG,OMG! This place is so good! The food is amazing! My husband and I got the stuffed mushrooms and stuffed corn. The corn was delicious and the mushrooms were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. We also got the smoked turkey which was absolutely delicious! This is a great place for a special
Restaurants,4.0,CG,My boyfriend had the taste of an old time favorite. He also had the cheese steak and he said it was delicious. The house salad was also very good. We had a very large group of people and everything was delicious. We will definitely be back. This is a great local restaurant with great food.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We came on a Monday afternoon. The hostess was very rude and didn't seem to care. We waited for about 10 minutes, before anyone came to our table. The food was mediocre at best. The bread was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Got the classic Pickles and Orange Chicken and the combo was good. 

The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the fries. The chicken was a little too tough and the fries were a little bland. 

I also ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We drive 20 minutes to go to the restaurant and try this place. The waitress was nice and we sat down.  The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside tables were dirty. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Five stars is not for the food, the service and the overall experience. I was just here for a late lunch and I must say that the food was not good at all. I ordered a couple of plates of mixed veggies and one of the veggies was still warm."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Awesome staff and great food! We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is super friendly and helpful.  He is the best customer service I've ever experienced.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken burrito with no onions
Restaurants,4.5,CG,My husband took there eat here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because our food was cold.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I always get the Benny's Steak with Macaroni and Cheese, and I'm pretty picky about macaroni and cheese.  The chicken is always so flavorful and it's just so good.  The pulled pork is always moist and tender and the pulled pork is always perfectly cooked. "
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food- 
Their meals are on par with most Mexican chains but always consistent quality/flavors/etc. 
Service- 
The staff are always polite and attentive. 
Menu-
This is what drove most of my 5/5 rating. There are a good variety of options and very reasonable prices. It's easily to have a cheat meal (Arroz Con Pollo) or find a healthier option without spending a ton."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Nice place. People were friendly, staff nice. Gets kind of loud, especially a couple of patrons at the time that would just NOT stopping talking, extremely loud. The bottle DIPA was a little pricey at $10 a bottle. In Atlanta, DIPA drafts are about $7.50-8, but never that high as a bottle. Will probably give it another try in the future."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We were searching for Indian Cuisine in the Tampa area and EVERYWHERE was already closing or closing in five minutes. This place doesn't look like much on the outside but our dishes were absolutely delicious. We've been back a few times and gone through the menu a little bit. Not sure you could order anything and it taste ""bad."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We have never had a bad experience here. Sunday brunch is incredible with some very unique and delicious menu choices. Their dinner menu is just as unique and full of tasty options, my personal favorite is the Belgian Clucker (chicken and waffles). The atmosphere is so laid back and positive - one of my favorite spots in Trinity, without a doubt."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"It was very bad experience The hostess was racist. Only colored people were made to sit On the back bar. Though 2 and 4 ppl seating was all open all the time. We felt really bad sitting at the table. 

Food was not good. The tomato sauce was straight from the can uncooked.  Don't know why ppl like this place."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I asked for a chocolate, mint frappe....It was repeated back to me ""Caramel, mint frappe""! No...Chocolate, Mint frappe. Again repeated Chocolate, caramel HOT frappe...? Uhmmm...NO! Chocolate. MINT. Frappe. Again repeated ""caramel, chocolate frappe...NO, chocolate, mint frappe. Yeah I didn't get what I asked for nor what I ordered for my husband right, his caramel macchiato hot had MINT in it! Ughhhhhh!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"3 amigos has been a favourite donair place for me, and I've been going there for about 6 years now! I love their donairs and cannot get enough!

There sit-in menu is awesome and super tasty. The waiter service is definitely very casual. Which I totally get it being a family business. However sometimes I'm waiting quite a while to get service,....."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Disappointed in manager service. Server was good, but came time to pay and was told cc machine had not been working for a while. Would not accept gift card. Server offered manager to over, young girl came over and said we could only pay cash. She did not offer to comp anything! My friend had to go to atm for $$$$."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Went on a Saturday night. Food and service were both excellent. The arugula salad special was crisp and fresh. My wife had the tow cheese gnocchi in a blush sauce. The portion was large and very well prepared. I had the veal saltimbocca which consisted of two nice size slices with excellent procutto and sage. Definitely a restaurant to go to.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Very satisfied. I was hungry but my wife wasn't. I had the cod and greens. Cod was cooked to perfection. Greens were very tasty. We shared a butter cake to end the night. Definitely will be back. Oh, my wife did have a drink that was new to the menu. An apple cider alcoho drink which she said was very good."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,A little disappointed that they've eliminated the shrimp & grits from the menu.  It was one of my favorites.  The salad in the smaller bowl with large ingredients that needed cut up is a big mistake.  Plus get rid of the plastic straws and take out containers already.  You're name is Bahama Breeze think of the environment.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"One World Market is one if my favorite places for sushi and great Japanese food. From Udon to sushi, the food is great! I also pick up groceries to make my own food at home. On a recent trip I purchased some scallop, uni, and  salmon to make homemade handrolls. Definitely check this place out - it will not disappoint."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Awesome food, a bit on the expensive end, great decor and ambiance. 

Highly recommend for food.

Was disappointed with the nightlife music. Expected authentic Latin dance-worthy music but the place turned into a club style Latin/hip hop, remix scene with an overcrowded floor.  You can catch this night club scene almost everywhere else; hence - only recommend Cuba libre for dinner."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Very slow. The staff working was not very fast to get meals out to people. The staff was not the friendliest and they were very vocal about an issue at the drive-thru that probably should have not been publicized throughout the restaurant. The location was clean and inviting, but not a top notch location. The food was warm and tasted great."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Disappointing and a shame....the place was charming with so much potential.  The wait staff was unfriendly and unwelcoming.  They seemed most of the time overwhelmed with a lot of eye rolling as new guests  arrived .  The food was just okay.  It is not worth the stop unless you just want to see the beautiful room.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This is our go-to place for bagels!

Bagels are fresh, made on-site, monthly bagel specials and a great variety of cream cheese options, sandwiches, etc. Cash or credit card.

Opens at 7am or 8am and closes at 2pm daily.

If you find another bagel place that beats K & A, send me a DM and I'll go visit just to compare! Love these bagels."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,The service was sloppy. We had to ask for a drink after we had already ordered. We ordered a burger and the fries. The fries were crispy. The burgers were great. The burgers were good. The fries were good. The coffee was cold. The food was ok. The only thing that was great
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Definitely decent BBQ.  Every time I go there, I've had a spectacular meal.  If you're looking for a good place to eat and get the flavor of BBQ, this is the place.  If you're looking for a place to enjoy a good meal, you should definitely stop by."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I have tried almost all of the restaurants in the area and it's always great! I recommend the gnocchi, the Chicken parm and the chicken sandwiches. Everything is very good and it's a great place to go for a special occasion.I really enjoy this place. The decor is a bit old"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I watched an employee redo a dirty dish with a dirty spoon after cleaning it up. I ordered a chicken sandwich and the fries. The fries were crispy, not crispy. The chicken was dry. The lettuce was not fresh. I will not be returning. This is a disgrace.I love this place."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"All I can say is that it was an experience. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but that is the only reason I give 4 stars.The food was great. The server was a bit lazy. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Roman Delight in Abington is a real gem.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Best coffee shop in nola.  The coffee is good, but not spectacular.  I ordered the coffee from the barista.  I took the coffee out of the bag and it was still cold.  It was good, but nothing special.  I don't know how long the bag was in"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,My boyfriend brought me back here for the first time in a while. The ambiance was awesome. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Wow.. Coming from San Diego, this place is the best. I will be back for sure!The best fried chicken in the area. The fries are crispy, and the chicken is cooked to perfection. The fried pickles are good too, as is the sweet potato fries.The food was amazing and the"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The Cedar Plank Roasted Salmon (Cedar) and a Tuna Salad (Tuna) with a side of Brie and the Bacon Bacon and Cheddar Cheese Tenderloin. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the bacon and cheese were perfect. My husband had the Roasted Salmon with a side
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Great locale with friendly atmosphere. Staff is always friendly and helpful. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was terrible. I went to go to a couple of friends and I was told it was going to be a 30 minute wait.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"SOOOOO GOOD! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had.

The cheese steak was awesome.

The drinks were also great. 

I think this place is going to be a regular stop for us. 

I wish I could give it 5 stars!This is"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Slow service and it was a little slow. Overall a good experience.Had a reservation for 4.50pm on Sunday. Ordered a small pizza, a chicken salad, and a chicken salad. Both were excellent. The salad was very fresh. The chicken salad was very good. The chicken was very good"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The very best Greek salad! We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is very friendly and helpful.  He is the best customer service I have ever experienced.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and it was
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Came in for a drink and an appetizer and both were fantastic. The cheese steak was awesome. The burger was very good. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the outside of the grill. I would come back for the burger again.
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"I stopped in for breakfast. Ordered two Sausage, Egg, Cheese Biscuits & two Bacon, Egg, Cheese Biscuits. They had no flavor & the biscuits were hard on the outside and dry on the inside. It was like eating mush between pressed saw dust. I can't believe I spent $16.00 on something so disgusting and tasteless. McDonald's will never have my business again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food was okay. Staff was nice. I ordered an egg-which and got it on a bagel. They didn't tell me I was going to be charged extra for the bagel. It took a while to get my food too. Also, the the bagel was soggy. If I was paying more than $6 I'd be upset but you get what you pay for."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Mmmmm.  My favorite Mexican food, and a place I always have to visit when I'm in Tucson.  The carne seca is divine.  This place has a huge selection of tequilas, too, and I haven't found anything bad on the menu.  Last time I was there, my friends and I even got our own table in a semi-private room!"
Restaurants,1.5,OR,Service is always slow but they do have the playground. Tables are dirty had to get a rag to wipe my own table down. Looks like a large staff just alot of standing around by management. Seems like there to busy talking to each other then the customer. Good food when you finally get it but they need a overhaul in management.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,So I'm over this place. Good food and drinks but when it comes to the bill it always says other than what was advertised. You'll have a hell of a headache with a party of 5 or more and try to split the bill. The manager is cool but the establishment itself needs some work. And so does the basement dining/bar area.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Covid 19 not stopping Race from pleasing their customer.  Order and pick easy and all so friendly! The chicken Parmesan dinner was delicious from the sauce to the chicken to the homemade noodles!  Plus there's bread and the most amazing salad with tomatoes and bacon.  The salad dressing was also delicious.  Plenty of good!  Definitely coming back
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Pretty busy on a Monday morning. I did not enjoy my food at all. I ordered the chicken fried steak and what i really got was a giant dried up steak smothered in gravy sauce with bland potatoes. The only good thing on my plate was the biscuit. I couldn't believe how expensive   The drinks were. The service was ok.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Summary: Surprisingly good barbecue just outside of downtown Indy. While this doesn't compare to the barbecue that you will find in Kansas City, Memphis, or even St. Louis, it is still VERY GOOD. Reasonably priced.

The full marbled brisket isn't worth the hype. Just tastes fatty and burn. 

Try the corn pudding,  it's delicious.  Wil keep me coming back for more."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Amazing drive in food. Tenderloin and burgers are generous in size with outstanding flavors. Floats and shakes are wonderful. Covid helped bring back the car hops who did a great job taking care of everyone. You must make the trip to this place. The onion rings were the perfect amount of batter plus the dipping sauce should be sold by the gallon.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The nachos were the surprise of this meal. We ordered it as an appetizer, and I was floored by the overall quality and originality. The chips had a baked taste, with lots of fresh cut jalapeño and pico. My burger was nicely prepared, and it was very thick. Almost a little too thick, actually, but who's complaining. Service was fast and friendly."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I came here once during a trip to Philadelphia. It was a chilly morning and I felt pretty hungry. I got their fully loaded sandwiches (maplewood smoked bacon, avocado, egg, tomato, greens and cheese) and hot milk. The sandwich was one of the best I've had in my memory. So many ingredients and so yummy! The breakfast here lighted up my day."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"The salads are healthy, fresh, and delicious and ready to grab and go if you're looking for a quick working lunch. Especially delicious salad dressings. Awesome gluten-free baked goods like sweet potato scones, banana bread, and cookies. The new owners are really friendly and helpful (as were the old owners) and their new earlier hours mean I can stop by before work."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've had a fair amount of Vietnamese food around the country and I think this place is legit. The pho and vermicelli bowl were both awesome. When I ordered in person, the man at the counter was very polite and helpful in explaining the menu, so this may be a great place to try if you're not yet familiar with Vietnamese food!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Amazing!  One of the best restaurants in the state of Indiana.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.  Crab cakes and tuna we're great appetizers!  Veal chop was amazing and you could tell it was milk fed veal!  My wife had their sea bass and it was amazing too!  Great service!  We will be frequent customers!
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"This is an outstanding restaurant! Our waitress Fiona provided the best service one could ever ask for! We ordered the early bird specials for dinner and we were amazed at the size of the meals along with the excellent quality of the food. 

Ignore the bad reviews on Yelp and give it a try like we did - you won't be sorry!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Where do I start?  We had the crab cakes which were a nice size for the price and we shared a cup of the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin.  We had the fried chicken and it was a perfect portion size.  The portions were large and the taste was excellent. 
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Our party went on a Wednesday night and the food was good.  The waitress was nice and we had a great time.  The food was good, but not great.  The rice was soggy and the shrimp were a bit tough.  I don't know how the restaurant gets a 2 star because"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place is good though.  The food is good but it's not great.  If you like burgers and the fries are your thing, then this is the place to go.  If you like burgers and fries, then this is the place to go.  If you like burgers and fries, then this"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"It's in the name chophouse-just go. The food is good but it's not worth the hype. Great atmosphere and great drinks! I got the ribeye, and it was great. The rice was good and the steak was good. I came here for lunch with my family."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"This is my favourite BPs in town and the food is good. The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The sauce is thick and creamy. The staff is friendly and helpful. I always get the same thing with the fries."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Probably one of the nicer places to dine in Reno. The ambiance is pretty cool. There's a cute spot, but it is a bit loud inside. I would definitely go there again. It's a little pricey for what you get, but it's definitely worth it."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My first time in Santa Barbara and I was very pleased with the food and service. We ordered the gnocchi and the Chicken parmigiana, both of which were very good. My wife had the Shrimp and Grits and I had the seafood pasta. The pasta was flavorful and the portion was"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is my favorite pizza place in the area. The pizza is always delicious, the staff is always friendly and the prices are reasonable. I also love the fact that you can bring your own dessert. I love the fact that they have gluten free options as well. I recommend coming here if you are looking for a"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Came to celebrate a friends birthday. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This bakery has THE best cookies in the city!  I will be going back!Very good. Very friendly service. The food is delicious and the staff is very attentive. I would definitely go again. 

The only negative was the customer service. The food was very good but the customer service was just"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Perfect, Clean, Delicious. The best part of the whole experience is the manager. He is the person you would expect from a new restaurant. He is also the person you would expect from a large family. He is personable and very personable. He even told me to take my money back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This was my first experience here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We were looking forward to
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Great service and great food! We will be back!Very good food. Very slow service. The food is good but not worth the wait. I love this place. The food is always great and the service is always great. The customer service is always excellent. The staff is always friendly.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The fresh strawberry and wedding strawberry flavors, the crunchy walnuts and crunchy caramelized strawberry.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Impressive food for delivery. I had the mushroom curry and it was fantastic. The cheese was a bit chewy and the curry was just a bit too sweet for me. I would definitely go back.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and it was
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Very poor service they never answer their phone and have no recording so you can't make a reservation or find out if they are open. They close earlier then their website says this is the south location I don't know if the others are that bad but I will take my business somewhere they are interested in meeting my needs not just theirs
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I went today with some friends for brunch at Panini's and we saw that they are serving breakfast now.

We order scramble eggs, over easy, and omelets but the eggs were cold; they could not hit one up either.

Some of us have Hash Browns as a side instead we get Hash Burns, completely brown.

The Cuban toast was not crispy and did not have butter."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"If you are looking for a greasy spoon, you've found it! Their food is pretty tasty and perfect for hangovers and clogged arteries. 

Zombie defensibility is pretty low though with a big outer facing window and low perimeter defenses. However, I think that most of the staff and patrons looked like they could hold their own should the apocalypse arrive at their doors."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I have been there 2 times.  Best steak and best roast beef, as good as a $$$$.  My friend had the pork chop which she rated best ever.  Prices, especially for drinks, are excellent.  Atmosphere is as nice as any top steak house and not noisy. Have not tried the Italian food but suspect that will also be great."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"I think that this location desperately needs some care and repair... particularly as we were having some major issues with our bowling lanes. But it is still a fun place to visit to bowl, play some pool and have some casual drinks/eats. The food is nothing special (particularly greasy) but it's a fun place in general. I wish it were more transit accessible."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Where else would I bring Bubbe for lunch when she visits from NJ?

Seriously good deli.  The pickle bar is a dream...  endless half-sours?  Yes, please!

All of the soups are phenomenal, the corned beef and pastrami are the real deal.  Big portions.  Dr Brown's soda.  It's just the right thing.

The only thing they're missing is the square knish...."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Shugar Shack is correct the yams, iced tea and lemonade straight SUGAR!!!
The Mac and cheese is okay doesn't taste baked!! 
The cabbage was okay string beans okay. Salmon rolls great pepper flavor should be called Pepper roll. they were blah the roll wasn't crunchy. I feel like I wasted 30 bucks today. The iced tea and lemonade are kool-aid don't be fooled."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"I was looking for a new place to have lunch today and came across this place on Yelp.  It is a little hard to find because it is located in a business park and there isn't good signage to help locate it.  I had a sandwich and soup for lunch.  My meal was very good, I will come back again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Nice little hidden gem in collinsville Illinois. I went and pick up breakfast and it was pretty good. The bartender working was really nice. Like how they made the place safe for social distancing and had protective covering not just the bar but at the table to keep ppl separate. Good food and good atmosphere. Definitely worth a try. I'll be going back.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"So many things to like about Germantown Cafe. For starters the food is really good; well made, interesting flavors and nicely presented. The staff is super friendly and helpful but not clingy. And Germantown as a neighborhood is quiet, laid-back and unpretentious. It's a great counterpart to many of Nashville's trendier spots and restaurants and a perfect go-to for a nice relaxing meal."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Place was chilly and food was greasy. My wife did not like the place at all. If it would be up to her it would be a 1 or 2 star. I ate my food though. It was ok and I guess I might have been just hungry. We went off recommendation of server but it was soak in grease at the bottom.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We love Peg's, both on Sierra and the on off Robb (or is it McCarran -- I can never remember). Food is terrific, service is average but always with a smile, and it is a homey comfortable atmosphere. Weekends can be crowded with a 30 - 40 minute wait, but it's worth it. All of the skillet meals are excellent."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Really fun place. We paid an extra $6 to see the flamenco show which started at 9:00pm. The atmosphere of the place is really cool because it's the oldest Spanish restaurant in America. The food was good, I tried the gazpacho and the pollo riojana. The bread that they gave was also really good and I tasted my friend's sangria which was delicious."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"While I have always enjoyed flowing tide- good food- easy drinks- great staff. THIS location is by FAR my favorite- and the O-N-L-Y one I come to! The vibe is a bit more chill- the staff always amazing and seem to love their job- so whether seeking food, drink, or great company- you'll find it here in patrons and staff members alike! Cheers"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I was in Nashville for the holiday  and it was my first time at this restaurant and I had to come back twice because the food was so good. The server was super friendly. I don't remember another time I've been so well served. Excellent service. The spicy margarita was perfect. The ambience and the music was great.
Restaurants,1.0,CG,"Come to this location too often. The food is just ok. The service is terrible. If you go to the West Philly location, you should get the Treme. The food is mediocre at best.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Very disappointed!

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Vacationing in Tampa for the weekend. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the covid.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I always pass by this place. The food is good but it's always a little slow. The atmosphere is great. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great.I'm so excited to come back to this place. The food is amazing and the service is great. I love the food and the atmosphere
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"I absolutely hate going to this place, the food is mediocre at best, and the service is poor.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tater tots, both were overcooked and hard to eat.  The chicken fried steak was very dry and the Tater tots were very bland. "
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"What a wonderful experience here. We had the Ribeye which was a nice size, the filet and the filet mignon, both were excellent. The steak was great, it was cooked perfectly and the steak was tender and juicy. The filet was cooked to perfection and the texture of the steak was excellent"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Had a very nice lunch. We had the Ribeye which was a nice size and the Clams. We also had the Seafood Po-Boy and the Tuna Tuna. The Po-Boy was great. The shrimp was fresh and the tuna was very good. The Tuna Tuna was very good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is a great restaurant, a great place to watch a game or for a drink.  The atmosphere is great.  The food is good, the service is good, and the food is good.  It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it.  The prices are very reasonable"
Restaurants,1.5,CG,Awful! We were tired on a Friday night and we decided to go back for a drink and just to get some food. The place was packed and we had to wait a while for our food. The staff was very nice and the food came out very quickly. The food was good but the service was awful.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We had some food delivered and it was good. We ordered a chicken salad, a shrimp and grits and a burrito. The food came out quick and the food was very good. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area.This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food is always fresh"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"A great dinner special! $20 for an appetizer, a drink, and dessert. I was pretty impressed with the food. The Chicken parmigiana was out of this world. The rice was soo good. The shrimp and grits were some of the best I've had. I had a chicken dish"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Without a doubt, one of the best restaurants in the city.

The ambiance is awesome. It's not the best but it's definitely the best. There's a lot of seating inside and outside and the decor is very trendy. There's a reason why it's called The Cheesecake Factory.
"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is a beyond popular spot. The food is amazing. The drinks are great too! If you're looking for a good spot to eat and have a good time, you should go to Ruby Slipper. It's a great place for a date night or to grab some drinks. I love the food and service."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"This place is a MUST visit!  I travel for work and am always looking for great places to eat. I read the other reviews and knew I had to give it a try. The food was not only aesthetically pleasing, it also  tastes amazing!!!  These guys know how to do vegan food the right way!!  I will definitely be back!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Not a fan. Service took way to long, 23 minutes to be exact for the waitress to come to our table just for drinks. We ordered our food, and the sides were small portions. Pork Chops were too salty, chicken was dry, and asking for some type of ""help"" was just out of the question. So glad this was a one and done spot."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We are new to the area and we have been to PJ's twice now. The ahi tuna steak is so good! All the food seems to be good, prices are reasonable, and servers are friendly. It's a very cozy, down-home atmosphere. I felt the size of the frozen drinks and the appetizers were a little small for the price but otherwise everything was perfect."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for a ""quiet"" evening, then do NOT go here. But if you are looking for a FUN time, this is the best Sushi restaurant in town. I particularly like the prices at happy hour.

Overall, it is a great atmosphere, really good food, and super reasonable prices. Definitely order the Las Vegas Roll when you go."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"So wanted to love the baked goods but they all were bland and boring.  Worst elephant ear ever, dry brownie, etc.  I think all the things we had were made days ago (we visited on a Sunday around noon).  Why can't American bakeries make things like those in Europe?  We won't be back.  Honestly, Tabora Farms is far better."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Room great for the price. The players sports bar. Was good. The French dip sliders were unbelievable. The players grilled cheese was great. We came here 2 times in 3 hrs.  Would stay here again. We stayed here on a trip to Greece. Parked car for 14 days and sleep very nice hotel to park and sleep and travel. Would stay here again.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had a wonderful time here for my friends birthday! Food was amazing, service was fantastic. They brought out free homemade ice cream with a candle for my friend without us asking! At the end of the meal, I called the manager over to thank him for a great time. Loved the atmosphere, felt like we were at a restaurant outside the city... No doubt."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I wish I could be reviewing their food but when me and my boyfriend stopped by, we stood at the door and weren't seated.  It didn't look busy at all so I'm not sure why we weren't seated.  I would have gladly waited IF someone would say ""I'm sorry we are really busy but we'll be right with you"".  We left."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Tacos were delicious! They come out on a tray with the rest of the party so they tell you which ones are yours. The waitress was very accommodating when splitting the check up and explaining each item on the menu when we had a question. Also, definitely recommend the margaritas! The tequila is made in house and also all the other ingredients are fresh."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"It's Yard House. Exactly what you'd expect. Very clean, large tables for big groups, and a bustling atmosphere. There's always a lot of people here since it's a mall location, but the servers keep things moving.

I've had tacos and quinoa salad here. Both were tasty and just exactly what I'd expect. Their menu is quite extensive so it's great for groups of picky people."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My wife and I decided to stop in and check it out and I'm glad we did. I got the brisket, she got the chicken pesto and mac and cheese. Everything was excellent. The brisket was tender and moist with just the right amount of smoke. The chicken had great pesto flavor. The mac and cheese was absolutely awesome. We will definitely be back."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,The staff are rude and dismissive. If you order one Burrito on the App and it says it will be ready for pick up at 6:20 be prepared to wait 30 minutes. If you try to ask the staff for help or when your food will be ready expert to be ignored or treated like you are annoying them. No one will acknowledge you.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My favorite restaurant when staying on Sand Key. The back porch is on the water and the inside is like a little Italy. Stella's mother was sitting at the front tonight. The food is excellent. The pizza is made like it is in Italy. Lumps of mozzarella, not grated. The potato dumplings are my favorite. I've been there twice this week."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Such unique and delicious food! I've been to Prep and Pastry on Grant two time and have had a great experience both times. The food on the menu was delicious and not normal restaurant food. The wait staff is friendly and VERY HELPFUL. The manager was awesome too. 

I had the best pastries after both meals too. My favorite was the marshmallow/peanut butter cronut!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came on a Tuesday night. It was surprisingly busy. Loved the atmosphere outside. Ordered the Revival cocktail which was amazing. My boyfriend and I tried the hot shrimp curry and the wino burger with fried green tomatoes. The service was great & our server seemed very knowledgeable of their menu. I will definitely be going back, preferably on a night with live music (Thurs-Sunday)."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"As a late night bar, this place is a must try.

The ambiance is awesome. It's not the best I've had, but the food is amazing. I've been to many other bars and restaurants, and this place is one of the best. If you're looking for a great place to have"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The food here was really good. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the service was so slow. The place was packed and the staff was not attentive at all. We had to ask for drinks and food in a timely manner. This was our first time coming here and we felt like we were being rushed
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We went to Liberty for a late lunch with my sister.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.   The place was packed and we had a great server who was attentive and helpful.  

We ordered a few appetizers (salsa, shrimp and grits) and a side of chips and"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,The staff and food here are always top notch and friendly. We have been here twice since moving to the area. The first time we had a great experience. The second time we had a great experience. The staff is always friendly and the food is always hot and fresh.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Fantastic food, caring and knowledgeable staff. The food is amazing. My husband and I have been here twice and we have had a great meal both times. The service is excellent and the food is amazing. We look forward to returning and will be back. This was our first time coming here."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Love Papa Murphy's it's like a real pizza. It's good but not spectacular. I like the extra cheese and extra toppings. The fries are crispy and you can't go wrong with that. They are fresh and delicious. I would come back for the wings and some pizza. The wings are a bit smaller than
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"While Dominos, in general, is a staple in the area. I will say that the food here is always delicious and the service is always great. 

I think Dominos is a great place to get a quick bite to eat, especially if you are with a large group. You can always count on them"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I love this place! Top notch service, great food and good prices. Definitely a must go!Great atmosphere and great food! I got the ribeye, and it was great. The rice was very good and the sauce was very fresh. The best part was the staff. The manager was very nice and friendly."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We stopped by last weekend and had the pleasure of trying out the brunch menu. I was not disappointed. The food was delicious. The egg and sausage egg sandwiches were delicious. The mac and cheese was a little bland. The grits were also very good. The service was also very good. The only downside was the wait
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I stayed here on the weekend and the hostess was very rude. When I got to the front she said we had to leave, and that she would be right back. I left because it was so hard to get a seat. The food was ok and the service was good. I would recommend to anyone looking to try"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Thanks for being a real Tampa resident, I'd say this is a solid place to go for a date night.  The food is solid and the drinks are tasty.  I've been to many other Tampa restaurants in the past, and it's always been good.  The staff is always friendly and the service is great"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Hmmm. maybe its me? I've been here 3 times now and I will admit that I have been disappointed.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was just okay. It was a bit on the salty side for my liking but still tasty. The fries were a bit"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars but it's just not the best Chinese food I've had. The food is mediocre and the service is not good either.I'm so excited to come back to this place. The food is amazing and the service is great. I love the food and the atmosphere.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Came here for the first time last night with my boyfriend.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  We ordered the wings and the fried chicken sandwiches.  The wings were ok, not great.  The fried chicken was good.  My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Ate here today and it was fantastic! We had a light lunch- sunshine salad, grouper bites and boom boom shrimp. The sunshine salad was fantastic, the oranges were super sweet and the lemon balsamic dressing was phenomenal. The grouper was obviously fresh and the tarter was ice cold. The boom boom shrimp were battered and fried in a sweet chili sauce. Our server was great."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great place! Authentic choices and fusion selections. Chef Kevin is knowledgeable and passionate about his cuisine. Quirky location but don't let that deter you. We enjoyed the beef hearts (think a really favorable  flank steak with a great sauce), of course the ceviche (excellent and probably the best in town). And papas a la huaccina.  Native beers and beverages, great scenery, awesome service."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Favorite bar for good beer and food. Food is good and the prices are great. The staff is also awesome. They have a few craft beers on tap on rotation. I come here when I want a few drinks and good bar food or to watch the game. Nice crowd and no troubles. I've been going for 10 years now and many more to come.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Favorite Mexican restaurant even though it's a 20 min drive. The time the food is ready at a reasonable time and take out tastes like eating at a restaurant. Food is very fresh, authentic, and delicious. I love the combo platters, tacos, and fajitas. You get a lot of good food for the price. It's not very spacious inside so it's best to do takeout."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. We always start our our breakfast with a French press, and I get the Grande Huevos Rancheros or the Popeye Skillet. Both are amazing and incredibly filling (I always have left overs). The staff here is friendly and prompt. You may wait a while, so I recommend calling about an hour ahead and you will be seated in no time."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I can't give a quarter star so I gave 1 star, they are absolutely terrible when it comes to either tourists or non-blacks, service sucked the food was cold and when we asked for items that were left off of our order, they took a long time bringing our remaining items. I wouldn't drag a dead crawfish into this biased place."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Big possibility they stole my friends debit card information, so pay with cash! She had to cancel her card a few days later after finding out that someone had been using it for online purchases. This was the only place she had used her card in a week where someone took her card and did payments out of sight. Very disappointing. Love the food though."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My family will never return to this restaurant. We have been customers for years, but after watching Marcus Flores degrade his staff in front of customers and them hearing him yelling at the workers in the kitchen, we could not finish our meal. It is a shame. The food was decent and our server Raul was awesome. But, the mistreatment was too much to stomach."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The ambiance is very romantic and nice.  Our waiter, Max, was personable, gave excellent recommendations and was a delight.   My honey had a Vieux Carre to drink and it was by far his favorite in town.   The Crab Ravioli was over the top.    The filet mignon special is highly recommended, if available.  We will definitely return."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My favorite sandwich shop in California. Usually I don't like sandwiches, but this place is special. They mix all the right ingredients like an excellent chef, bread is tasty, and sauces accent perfectly. Sandwiches are huge and I usually only eat half; saving rest for the next meal. They do get busy so recommend ordering online about 20 minutes before arriving."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I've been here a few times and it's usually wonderful. Until you get stuck in the back by the bathrooms. Our appetizers arrived 15 minutes before our drinks, our drinks were ultimately wrong and my sriracha never came. It was a mediocre experience with sushi that is usually highlighted by exceptional service yet this time it fell flat. Probably getting a little over their heads."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We ate here on Christmas Eve, having arrived an hour before the restaurant officially opens. They welcomed us, and we were served by one of the nicest gentlemen, Neel. The food was beyond exceptional from the goat cheese and crawfish crepes to the bread pudding. Easily one of the best meals we have had over our extended travels. We highly recommend this bistro to everyone."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food is pretty good. I had the veggie burger with sweet potato fries. My wife had the tuna steak sandwich with kale salad. Both were good and decent proportional sizes. Service was ok, the waitress was almost to motivated and stopped by the table what seemed every 3 or 4 bites...not bad for a quick fix while at the mall for a day of shopping."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Well, the food was pretty good. Service was very inattentive, especially initially.

Oh yeah, when the owner comes and hits on your date, like he has in the past with others, but does not even introduce himself to you or acknowledge your presence, and then has an attitude when you introduce yourself and offer your hand... it doesn't add to the experience in a positive way."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Such good food!! We have been here 3 times now and we will be back for sure!The best fried chicken in the area. The fries are crispy, and the chicken is cooked to perfection. The fried pickles are good too. The fries are thin and chewy. The sauce is always a nice sweet touch."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This may be good for some, but the food is pretty average. There is a decent selection of other items on the menu. The service is also pretty good, so it is pretty easy to get a seat. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a quick and tasty lunch."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Ordered Huevos Rancheros and they were amazing!  We ordered two of the pulled pork sandwiches and one of the two grilled chicken sandwiches.  Both were fantastic!  The pulled pork sandwich was so tender and had great flavor.  I would highly recommend this place and will be back soon!This is a great
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Gross, feel sorry for the woman behind the counter, she was rude and didn't seem to care. I had the burrito and a friend had the chicken burrito. The burrito was pretty good. The chicken burrito was a bit thick for my liking. But the burrito was pretty good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is a very good spot to dine and watch the game. There is a large outdoor seating area so you can sit inside or out. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. They have a great selection of beer on tap. If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant in a nice place with good food and
Restaurants,4.0,CG,My husband and I were here for the weekend and decided to try a new place. We ordered the gnocchi and the Chicken parmigiana. The chicken parmigiana was amazing. We also ordered the gnocchi and it was fantastic. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the chicken was tender and juicy
Restaurants,3.0,CG,So you all know Taco Bell has the best food in Nashville. The food is always delicious and the service is always great. I think this place is going to be a regular stop for me. I will most likely be going back to try the other items on the menu.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,When we went I wanted to go inside and try something new but they didn't have a menu. We ordered the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was pretty good and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was good. The chorizo was a little tough to eat and
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Came in looking for pandan and it was a very pleasant surprise. The food was good. The drinks were good, but the food was not great. I had the chicken and waffles and it was very dry. I would come back for the chicken and waffles."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Worth a try! If visiting Tampa, you are going to need to come here for the food and the atmosphere. Great drinks and the food is good too!I love this place. Food is amazing and the service is amazing. I will always be coming back and will recommend it to everyone.I was looking for a quick"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"This is a review on the food and the service. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but that is the only reason I give 4 stars. I came here on a Tuesday night and it was about 15:30. I ordered the churros and they were very good."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place is great, the food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable! The best thing about this place is the atmosphere! I will definitely be back!I love this place. The food is always great and the service is always great. I wish I could give it 5 stars. I love the food and service."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Disappointed. Very pricy for what it is. Not worth it. The best thing about this place is the food. The food is good, but not amazing. The service is not great either. The waitresses are lazy. This is a great place for a quick lunch."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Five star for their customer service. The food was good but nothing special. The reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was not great.I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"What a cute fun place for happy hour!  It has a good vibe. Guac, margaritas, cold beers were all good.  There was a happy hour with $2 guacamole that was a big hit.  I tried the chicken quesadilla -- also good and great for sharing.  
Try to arrive early. there is always a crowd, and parking is challenging but you'll find one."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came for lunch, seated quick. My wife got the lunch special (salad/jambalaya/bread pudding), I got 1/2 doz raw oysters and artichoke/oyster soup. 

We loved it all. Oysters were fresh and tasted of the sea (I'm pretty hard grader of oysters). Only thing I would ask for is whole oysters in the soup, not diced. 

Jambalaya was excellent, spicy but not too much. Bread pudding was fantastic."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"We were  insisting on vacation and wanted a non chain pizza place. Nashville pizza did not disappoint! The pizzas were delicious! The mozzarella sticks and wings were a 3.5/5 stars but the pizza was 5/5! The delivery was excellent through Grub Hub. 

We ordered a second time this week and had even better pizza. I had a little complex order and they got it right!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"First visit in a long time,Kept it simple ordered a tune club and asked for hard boiled egg on it.Took some time to get it and when it arrived my club had a fried egg on it which was disgusting.I choked it down,if you don't have a hard boiled egg simply tell a person .It will be another long time before we go back if ever."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Phenomenal food
If you get their signature sandwich ""Pickles & Swiss""
I would recommend adding Dijon and bacon and subbing ham for turkey! GET THOSE PICKLED VEGGIES BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE SANDWICH- ASK FOR EXTRA!!!

Dean & Bryce made us feel completely at home and helped us with our decision making on our meals- SO FRIENDLY! 

Terrific staff!

If this is a chain, PLEASE EXPAND TO SAN JOSE BAY AREA!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food was excellent.  I love brussel sprouts, and it was great to see them on the menu.  Salmon hash hit the spot after a long run that morning.  Coffee is excellent (from Kaldi's).  

The service was on the better side of okay.  If they could get the wait staff on the same level as the food, the place would be amazing."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Drove up from st Pete to try this gem. Read the reviews so I had to try.

Small hole in the wall with the best falafel an shawarma this side of the bus station in tel Aviv. We had a falafel in pita and a shawarma in pita. Fresh and delicious
Ammon the owner is great and really takes pride in his food.

Can't wait to go back again"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"To start off, the wait was shorter then expected. They expected the wait to be 25-30 Minutes but we got a table in about 7 minutes. After we were seated we ordered two appetizers, and they were very good. I recommend the chicken nachos because the chicken went well with the queso. The only downfall is that the wait for the food was over 40 minutes."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"One of the best pizzas I've had in South Tampa! All fresh, high quality ingredients. Love that they have a wide selection of toppings to choose from. The pizzas could use a bit more seasoning and I asked for fresh garlic on the margarita pizza but couldn't taste it. Could also use a bit more basil. The tomato sauce they use is amazing."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm a fan. I really love to get myself a nice iced coffee or vanilla bean frap. I've also gone there for lunch, I got the Gobbler. It's really good. It's thanksgiving between two slices of delicious bread that comes with a great salad. I wouldn't mind the prices being less expensive, but it's well worth it. I go in quite often and I love it."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Totally lives up to the hype. An old fashioned burger stand in the perfect place, in downtown Carp close to the beach and camping. Long lines (20min+\-) on a summer Sat fail to deter most customers for the simple reason the food is old-school wonderful. Good meat for the burgers and fresh ingredients including iceberg lettuce and fresh tomatoes. An extensive menu including tacos and burritos."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Legit waited for 20 minutes in the drive-thru before getting my food (I was the only car). I should have just left or gone in, but I was too hungry and lazy to change course. My sandwich ended up with cold cheese instead of being melted and the wait made me too cranky to enjoy my lunch. I'll definitely pick a different Subway next time around."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,My husbands favorite spot for barbque. It's good stuff. I'd recommend it to others. I've had the peach cobbler. It's not my momma's but it's a good substitution when I need something sweet and reminiscent. To eat we usually get the brisket and hot wings. Those wings are extra hot so be careful. Be sure to get Hanks sauce and you can buy it as well.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Called to place a order ahead. Asked the lady how long it would take she said she didn't know. I asked again to give me the time since I was coming from far away. She literally said "" are you gonna order or not? Or Ill have to hang up"", and so she did! Unbelievable. Never experienced such a bad customer service in my whole life!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I was looking forward to this place and thought it would be a nice place to have dinner. The atmosphere is not very open but the food is delicious! I got the pork belly and it was so good! It was served on a bed of rice and beans with some veggies and beans. I was very satisfied with the food and will
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This was a 100% surprise.  The food was amazing.  We had the yellowtail and the gnocchi.  The gnocchi was the best part.  The dish was cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was fresh.  The bread was soft and flavorful.  The sauce was a little spicy but the flavor

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Meh. I ordered biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were just ok. The gravy was a little too sweet for my taste. The biscuits were solid and the gravy was tasty. The biscuits were a little soggy and not good enough for me. I would come back for the biscuits. I think it's a good place to

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I've been here a few times and the food is consistently good.  However, the service has been a little slow.  I've had to wait a bit to be seated, but that's part of the charm.  I've also had to wait a bit to be given menus.  I've had to wait to be"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We had dinner Saturday 12. 8. 18 and it was an average experience. The waitress was very rude. I had the Chicken parm and my wife had the Chicken Satay. We had to ask her to get the check. The waitress told us she would give us a receipt with the check.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We are take out people and have never had a problem with them. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was terrible. I went to go to pick up my order and I was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I was told it was taking 45-60
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I love Haven. I love the flavors and the food. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to get your food to go, you can't go wrong with Haven. They have a great selection of beers, cocktails and wine. This is a great place for a special occasion. I have also tried the"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"It really pains me to write a review for a restaurant that is so close to the airport, but I can't say enough good things about this place.

This place is pretty cool. It is in the heart of a shopping center. It is very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. The food is really good."

Restaurants,4.5,OR,Damn good Tacos. Fresh and crispy around the edges corn tortillas. Everything is made to order. The ladies in the back don't speak a lick of English so you know this place is going to slap. Fresh chips and flavorful salsa. This is my go to spot. I always get 5 tacos but now I'm going to explore the menu and see what them Abuelas working with.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"A+!!! One of my favorite brunch spots in Philly, WELL WORTH the long wait on weekends. Their special brunch menu rotated every 2 weeks - it boggles my mind how they come up with their combinations! Worth taking friends, too, who've never been to PHL before with their cozy seating and USA 1950's diner feel to the whole place. A must-go on anyone's list of brunch spots!!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Literally the best Dan Dan noodles I've ever had. Now I'm living out west and I can't find a place that compares. Really cute establishment, very clean, and great service. The manager, I think his name was Jonathan, was hilarious and went above and beyond for us. Highly recommend. Next time I'm in town I will definitely have to go back and try some other menu items."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Really disappointing food. Came here for a dinner meeting with @ 45 people. The bruschetta was great. Pretty much the rest of the food sucked. The calamari was soggy & mostly peppers. The beef was tough. Only 2 desert choices: chocolate cake or carrot cake. Chocolate cake was fair, the Cesar salad was actually ok too. Why everybody thinks the food here is great is beyond me."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Always a welcome sight when on Interstate 95 and mother nature is telling you - ""it's time for a bathroom break!""

Plus lots of basic dining fast-food options, caffeine, ice cream, convenience store goodness, and just basic stretching your legs.

If you are going northbound towards I-295/New Jersey Turnpike - this is a must stop as there just ain't a whole lotta places to stop on the NJ Turnpike!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Awesome thai food !  We especially love the restaurant (the ambiance created by their decorations goes a long way in establishing a serene and enjoyable experience).  Great service too !  We especially enjoy their pork dumplings, chicken massaman, pork pad thai, beef noodle bowl and any type of duck they serve.  This makes a great ""date night"" location !  Highly recommended !!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is the most garbage food I've ever had. Ordered a house salad, buffalo chicken sandwich, and toasted ravioli as to go. Got the wrong salad, fries were cold, toasted raviolis were sub par. I don't think I have ever had a buffalo chicken sandwich I did not enjoy, but I could not eat more than one bite of this one. Lesson learned, will not be returning."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,If you're looking for a good reasonably priced breakfast and lunch place this is it. Nothing fancy or frilly here just good homemade style food and old fashioned service. The place is clean and well run with the owner onsite. Everyone is friendly and personable at this cozy diner. Conveniently located on East Bay near the country club and Hungry Howies. The chili-cheeseburger is a family favorite.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The food was really good and you get large portions. I had leftovers for the next day. Their drink special, especially the bucket of craft beer on the weekends, are fantastic. We will be back for the drinks and probably come to eat on occasion. The staff was nice and the decor is so cute. They really went with the theme and had great attention to detail."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"So when you are hungry and coming home from a Phillies game on Sunday this is great place to stop and get your BBQ on. If you can, come on mondays and do the buffet. You can sample all their stuff (or allot of it anyway). The meats are always great, smoked perfectly and the sides are really good too. I like the kielbasa, ribs and brisket."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Had the pork provolone broccoli rabe combo for the first time today.   It was delicious.   Very generously sized sandwich with a ton of shaved pork.  The broccoli rabe is a little bitter...for that reason I think I still prefer the cheesesteak.   But I finished every last bit of that sandwich so it comes in at a very close second :).
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place has the best mushroom swiss burger I've ever had. EVER. Aaaaand it was stuffed. Omgoodness! The fries were delicious too- I had the sweet potato and Hubba had regular. Both great. So the menu says ""best hot wings ever"" and we will have to come back to try them out since at this point I'll believe anything this place tells me! Two big thumbs up!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"WOW!  The service was great and the wings were great!  We went and the wings were. 49 cents each and they were delicious!  Not only were there several flavors to choose from, but you can choose how many of which wing you want. I really enjoyed this location and I am so glad it is in my neighborhood."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I will give a 5 star rating just for their lemonade!!!! Now, please understand, i enjoy my wine, and they have a VERY nice selection!!! but i crave their lemonade! it is amazing! and worth the trip! they also make a mean ravioli!  its a quaint little place that only locals know about, and always a place i like to take out-of-towners for some good italian!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I ordered delivery and they were not impressed with the food. The food was good. The burrito was alright. The chicken was okay. The tortilla chips were okay. The tamales were okay. The service was good. The only thing that stood out was the salsa.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"First time trying  Sweetwaters, and it was the best experience I have had in a long time. The atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly and the food is tasty. The only thing that I would change is the price of the beer they serve. This was worth it. Great food, great service."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Large sandwich (Santa Maria) but it was the only one in the restaurant.

The food was good.  The burrito was a bit small but the flavor was good.  The rice was good.  It was good size.  The carne asada was very good.  

The service was great."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"THE DONUT!! Omg are you kidding me, the donut was amazing. The cheese was warm and crispy. The donut was also a solid 4 stars!

This place is a hidden gem!Delicious breakfast in a beautiful location. The best thing about this place is the staff. They are very friendly and quick to"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The Worker Bee has a nice selection of drinks and a good selection of cocktails. I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I would definitely go again.The best in the area. The food is great and the service is great. I love the 2 day delivery time and it's always
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"I do love my pizza here. The crust is thin and crispy. The cheese is fresh and the toppings are crisp and the meat is crisp and the sauce is delicious. I love that it's a little smaller than other pizza places. I wish I could get a pizza from here everyday. They have a nice selection of pastries,"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"If you want a store that has the quality and quality of a chain, go to this one.I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked to perfection and the chorizo was flavorful. I would come back for the burrito.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,This was my first time here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We were looking forward to eating here and it was
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I need to get there early to make sure we're all full.

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty.  I've been to many other bars and restaurants that have a good beer selection.  I've been to several bars and restaurants that have a good beer selection, but"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This tavern fills up fast and has the best food in Nashville. The food is always delicious and the drinks are always great. I think this place is going to be a regular stop for me. I will most likely be going back to try the food again soon. Great food and service.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Stopped in for a slice of pizza and a bite to eat. The slices were very large and had a nice crispness. The sauce was tasty. I enjoyed the sauce and had no complaints. I would come back for the pizza. The food was ok. The service was excellent.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The food here is bland and has the typical taste of a cold Italian meal. I would recommend the gnocchi. The gnocchi is crispy, not chewy, and it's cooked to perfection. It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it. 

The service is great and they make"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Living across the street from this place, and we decided to try it for ourselves. We ordered the gnocchi, the Chicken parm and the chicken sandwiches. Everything was very good. We also had the bread pudding. Both were very good. My husband had the chicken parm and said it was the best he's had in a"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,We showed up at 1:30 and the hostess was rude and didn't even acknowledge us. We had to ask for the manager. He then said we didn't have enough time to go to the bar and we would have to wait. I told him to give us another chance and he gave us the benefit of the doubt.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Iron Hill is our go to place for happy hour on Friday nights. The food is always delicious and the beer is amazing. The burgers are always recommended. We especially like the Raspberry Wheat and  Pig Iron Porter.  The service makes Iron Hill above the rest, especially Peggy, who goes above and beyond to make being at Iron Hill a place to keep coming back too."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I absolutely LOVE T-Flats, any location.  Their queso is delish!!  Ask for the ""special queso"" sometime for an off menu treat.  I love that they use fresh jalepenos instead of the crappy canned ones.  Try the sweet chili sauce off the hot sauce bar.  I've tried almost the whole menu and it's great, but I wasn't a big fan of the taco salad."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Such an amazing place to dine at. Out waiter was not only kind and very attentive but also made sure to follow covid-19 protocol. Their food was amazing and honestly I couldn't have asked for a more perfect meal. I highly recommend going and spending time at this restaurant, I'm not sure of the waiters name but he has blonde is hair and was just the sweetest person!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My wife recommended this place froma visit she had six years ago.  While the flavors of the mean were great, $29 for a couple slices of brisket is over the top.  I have a bbq place back home that would blow this place out of the water.  I thinkk the food is over priced, but still tasty.  I think the hype is too trendy."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We go here to see movies we barely want to see, just because we love the bistro theater so much! Incredible price for the experience. Service can be a little slow mid-movie (there have been a few times that I ordered a second beer early on and didn't get it in time to finish it before the movie was done), but all in all, it's a great venue!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Probably the best ""first date spot"" in NOLA for young people. Location is perfect and the string light ambiance makes it an exciting but also casual place to meet for a glass of wine and a bite to eat. I would call the food gourmet bar food. My absolute favorite is the mussels with fries. The broth is so delicious- i always ask for extra bread for dipping!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The food is good, in general. The variety is good. They have lots of options. The biscuits and corn bread are good. There's plenty of tasty meats and egg dishes; fresh omelets and poached eggs. The service is impeccable. It's worth the money. The only thing is that the red beans weren't tasty at all and a little thin; very saucy with less beans. I would visit again."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,The food is good when you finally get it.    Service continues to be slow to non-existent.  Meantime the mgr runs around like a chicken with its head cut off not helping.  3 people working the drive through when no cars there but a lobby of people waiting for a seat.   Someone needs to teach the mgr who to run a restaurant.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"If you are looking for ethnic and healthy food, this is the place to shop. Their produce is always priced reasonably and I love their breads, coffees, cheeses, yogurts...No matter what, I have to go shop for groceries weekly. Their cashiers are fast and knowledgeable. The perfect place to shop for your groceries if you love to eat heathy. even the junk or snack foods are healthy :-)."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Went in to today for lunch, cashier was alerted of spill on floor. The crew took their time to go address, child slipped and injured his head. No significant choices as advertised on their commercials. Dirty and unkept. Looks like they are cutting back, security cameras ripped off of walls trash on floor, no service attendant picking up plates. What happened to this place? Will not be back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,IMHO so far the best steak you can buy in Philly. They specialize in aged steak and the flavor of a 30 day aged steak is truly unique. We just tried Butcher and Singer the other night and we will have to agree it's just not in the same level as Barclay when it comes to flavor alone. We will be looking forward to our next Barclay steak!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had a bowl of very delicious Tom Kha soup, followed by absolutely excellent panang beef. I'm very boring in my Thai food ordering--I always get panang beef. This was spicy without being searing and had a few different vegetables in it instead of just green beans (or none at all). The meat was tender, and the sauce was very rich and thick. A very nice meal overall."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"First time going, went with my wife on her break cause she recommended it. The yellow curry with chicken is what I had and it was pretty insane. My wife had pad thai with tofu and I will have to get that next time since it was so good. We'll be going back for sure. Only down side is it's so busy, but that isn't a bad thing."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Our dinner here was absolutely divine! We started off with some wine and cocktails that were great. Then got the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese (THE BEST) along with the Grilled Artichoke. The Mahi Mahi was sensational! And don't get me started on the dessert, the Crème brûlée was OUTSTANDING to say the least. Overall, really impressed with this place. Great for a fancy date spot with the lady!"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"The food here was great. We had the crab cakes which were a nice size for the price and we shared a small plate of the veggie and fried chicken sandwiches.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Really solid romen, which isn't a bad thing. 

We were also treated to a couple of complimentary desserts. 

We will definitely be back.I'm a fan of this place.  It's in a strip mall near the Airport.  The food is good.  I like their sweet potato fries and the"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food is very salty and has a lot of salt. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The sauce was nice and spicy. The shrimp were good size, but it was a little too salty. The sauce was a little too sweet for our liking."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place was so good that I had to try it out. 

The food was good.  The drinks were good, but the food was not great.  I had the seafood gumbo and it was good, but nothing special.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was good but nothing to write home about."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"One of the few places that has the best food in Nashville.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"As a vegan, this is a must visit. It is a great place for a quick bite and a drink. Great drinks and the food is amazing. The vegetarian chicken salad is amazing as well. The staff is very friendly and the service is quick. This is a great place to have a drink and a snack with your family."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Not the best, but not the worst.  We ordered two pizzas for 2 people and one to go.   The pizza was delicious and the salad was tasty.   The only thing that was disappointing was that the pizza was extremely thick.  I don't know how long the pizza was in the oven, but it was tough"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Gourmet tacos and some of the best I've had in Nashville.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Service was OK but the food is not as good as the last time I was there and it was not good then.
The only thing worth having is the Pacifico and there was no draft beer. We had lunch enchiladas and beef taco's. There was no spice, the rice was tasteless as was the taco. The enchilada was not as good as Taco Bell which is mediocre at best."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Nice vibe. Waited and 1hr for a table inside which it wasn't bad because I went to Landry's and ordered a drink at their bar. The waiter was nice and always came back to check on us! I would've gave it a 5 star rating but the food wasn't the best. But over all it was a nice experience and the view of the lake was nice as well!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Always a fun food excursion. Very very busy today but it was Saturday and  filled with too many foodie thrill seekers. I ate at Dinics's and ordered the roast pork with rapieni. It was a perfect balance of cheese to meat to bread and i was very happy with this classics sandwich. The place was mobbed and I'd like to go back again when it wasn't so crazy
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Only complaint here is they charged extra for rice. Never heard of that, but oh well.  Everything we got was great.  The fried tofu in spicy sauce with Chinese vegetables were one of the best cooked and tasting tofu I've had anywhere.   The veggies were fresh and crunchy, tofu was firm and had a little crunch, and the sauce was spicy and rich to perfection."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Location close to beach. Drink is watered down for ""responsible drinking."" Food is so so. Fish stix is fried really deep, batter is quite thick, not a fan I guess. The lostah roll doesn't have much lostah, tastes pretty light though which is better than the other on we ordered. Overall pretty mediocre experience. If you crave food and doesn't mind the tastes too much then go for it."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Wow best brunch ever! Its breakfast AND lunch, really. Some say brunch, but are more breakfast. From mashed potatoes, pasta, to prime rib and a full omelet station! Service was so impressive too. My server was excellent and so was the man making my omelet-  they really go out of their way to make you feel so welcomed. A must try. Oh, how can I forget, bottomless mimosas!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I strongly suggest you make time in your schedule for a leisurely stroll through the Grounds for Sculpture. It is truly unique! Every turn in this beautiful park is an adventure--surprising you with original, larger-than-life sculptures, hidden alcoves for meditation, and relaxation and life-sized depictions of impressionistic paintings by Renoir, Monet, Matisse, and others. The grounds also provide two outstanding restaurants for your dining pleasure. Don't miss this treasure."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I got Ekta to deliver to me, and the chicken korma was creamy and nutty and flavorful.  The chicken was just a tad dry.  When reheated as leftovers, the dish improved.  My veggie BF enjoyed his dish, the kadai paneer.

Overall it wasn't the holy grail of Indian food, but it satisfied my indian food craving.  I intend to try King of Tandoor and Tiffin next."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Recommended by someone who works locally, this was a bright spot in a street filled with chain restaurants.  Fresh, delicious and not too fast, or too slow!  I had a tuna wrap and green bean side that was just perfect.  I can see why the parking lot was so full when I got here for lunch!  Jeff at the bar took great care of me."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,I had a great lunch here yesterday I had ceaser salad and burger with fries man they give u way too many fries.  the burger Is best burger I ever had the manager told me it was a secret beef blend. I was disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for a ceaser salad other than that love butcher and singer classy restaurant and top notch service
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The fiancé and I went there last week the sushi was amazing !!! The service was great! The price was reasonable. The manager was funny with his corny humor. The one thing we both disliked was their door bell ringing when people came in. It was really annoying. When your there next listen for it and you will understand what I mean. 

We will be going there again !!!"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,The food at this location never disappoints. We are creatures of habit so he always get the bacon temptation omelette (egg whites) with steak tips & pancakes (yum) and I love the stuffed French toast. It can be overly crowded but the service is good. We never have a long wait time but it's usually just 2-3 of us. I have seen parties with 5+ people that wait longer.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Too slow.. 15 minutes for food when there's no line up.. Really?  What do you do when it's busy?  And for a $9 sandwich I expect enough meat that you can see it in the bread... Lastly I watched a kid who had his computer and school work spread all over a table grab a filthy rag and wipe down the equipment and then the tables... Gross..
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The breakfast was fantastic, the Club sandwich was subpar, dry bread, salty ham, bacon overdone. The coleslaw was good. Our server was excellent and friendly. Although super busy with a wait list, the food came out quickly and hot. Very busy with a line to pay our tab. 

Very extensive menu. Definitely a diner where families come with little ones to enjoy a cost effective meal. 

Free on-site parking."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We ordered take out from here last night. We ordered two pizzas, a cheesesteak and a burger.  The pizza was delicious and the cheesesteak was great.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,The wood fired pizzas were delicious. The meatball pizza was also very good. I would recommend.I've had the best experience here.  The staff was friendly and the food was delicious.  I ordered the salmon and I'm glad I did.  The salmon was very flavorful and the sauce was great.  I had the loaded baked
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Best $20-something buffet I've ever had. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our food and then the server never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the buffet. The servers were a bit rude to us and it
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I always get so excited when I see the food. I always love the cheese steak and the fries. If you want to get a burger and fries, you have to go to the original burger place. It's in a strip mall on Mass Ave. This is a great place for a quick lunch. I have also tried the vegetarian burger and chicken"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"So normally I would give this place 3 stars, but I will not be going back.  The food is not very good.  I have ordered the Tuna melt twice and it was just ok.  It was bland and not very flavorful.  I will not be coming back.  The prices are very high and the service is horrible."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Tried this place for the first time last night! SO GOOD. The atmosphere is really fun, a very sports-bar feel with big garage doors that they said they open up in summer. Yummy burgers and fries, paired well with a delicious frozen strawberry margarita!! Amazing service, as well as a visit from the manager after our meal to check in. Will definitely be returning to try more from this menu!!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Very good latte decorated with some coffee art! Always fun! Service was great and the food (which we didn't even know they had upon arriving) was incredible. The sweet French toast was perfection. It wasn't too heavy like some can be. It came with the right amount of fruit and everything. This is a great neighborhood spot and I would really like this place to stay for a long time!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Amazing hot pot place in Philly! It was snowing today, so perfect weather for something warm and hearty. The wagyu beef was quality meat; really enjoyed the beef brisket and beef tongue. The wagyu nigiri was yummy, a fun experience with the presentation. For veggies, I enjoyed tong ho (my favorite!), daikon, wintermelon and watercress. Also our server Quynh was super nice and helpful :) definitely would come back again!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Walked in to the restaurant , can't see anybody even though today is Saturday. The waitress looks very rude to me. Gave me a cup of water and n menu in a bad way, then she sat back to her chair and play with her phone. I was totally surprise with her attitude! And I walked out , don't think I will come back again ! Really makes me disappointed"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is one of most dependable restaurants in the area. Service is always good, and the food is always good. Highly recommend the crispy duck and the pad thai. Both are delicious, although the drunken noodles are good too. For appetizers, the beggar's pouches can't be beat. 

As others have said, parking is tough in this neighborhood, so you might end up a few blocks away, but it's worth it."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I believe this spot is fairly new. The friendly cashier, Tailor, said 3months. They make your tortillas fresh on the spot! Our burritos were huge, my other half will be lunch tomorrow  Clean and fun beach themed restaurant. Their staff was very friendly and offered us a sample of all of the meat and sauce options since it was our first time in. That tomatillo ranch-YUM! Great Sparks find"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've had good meals and not so good meals here. The chicken quesadilla is good (especially with the chipotle ranch to dip it in, but the ranch is an up charge).  Everyone raves about the margaritas but they don't taste much different from any other restaurant if you ask me. Overall, good food and good service but a little on the pricey side for the quality/quantity that you get."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"We've been coming to Margaritas for about 10 years. I needed a venue for my daughter's Quinceañera. We chose to come here, I'm so happy we did! It's a tradition for me to take her here every year for her birthday. We got the patio. Prices were reasonable. Food was great! Joe Wynn helped us from start to finish. We had dancing and our Quinceañera music."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"It's about time Indian cusine became mainstream American, these guys seems to have done it.!!
They are in to give Chipotle  the run for the shitpot..pun intended...!!
Great ambience, wide menu choices (veg and non veg), good calorie balance, good concept, perfect execution. Food is savory, although compromised authenticity to be adaptable to bbq style home cooked food, great spread for the money. Hope they open more locations in the suburbia.."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The food upstairs to the Couch Tomato is a little bit different, smaller plates and a more intimate setting. The staff is great and helpful and the beer selection is decent! If you haven't already been to the 5-star eatery downstairs, do yourself a favor and check out both. You CAN'T be disappointed! Free valet for customers, and drive-up pick-up! Really a no-brainer for great food at a decent price!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I love Portillo's.

  It is a nostalgic throwback to when I lived in Chicago. All of the food is fantastic. It just depends on what you are craving at the time. The decor is great and they have brought the essence of Chicago to Tampa.

 We have been multiple times and will continue to do so when I need an Italian beef fix or a hotdog with chartreuse relish!!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Average at best. 
We desperately want a good Mexican restaurant in the area, unfortunately this place is not it. The food is bland , which I find weird for Mexican food. The beer selection is impressive. However on our last visit I suspect the lines were dirty as the beer was flat. 
Keeping our crossed they get their act together. It really is a great environment and a fantastic location."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Picnic has delicious food and the most friendly wait staff I think I've ever encountered! I went there twice on a recent visit to New Orleans and I'm still thinking about how great the food and cocktails were! On both occasions we had the sweetest and most helpful waitresses! They were truly delightful to talk to and clearly took pride in the fantastic food at Picnic and their wonderful city.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I try to support local businesses and locally sourced food. I will continue to support this local business.I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked to perfection and the chorizo was flavorful. I would come back to try their other items. They also have a few other burritos and a lot
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We're from Texas and this is a family favorite. We've tried a lot of the local favorites. We always have the best food, drinks and service!I think this place is pretty cool. The staff is very nice and I really enjoyed their customer service. The food was good, but I felt like it was a bit overpriced for the amount"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,OMG!! Such a cute little spot. The food is amazing. My husband and I got the stuffed mushrooms and stuffed corn. The corn was delicious and the mushrooms were tasty. The stuffed mushrooms were cooked perfectly and the corn was good. We will be back!We had a wonderful experience at the restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was great
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Service was fast, flavor was good. The only complaint is that it's kind of hard to find. I had the burrito and a friend had the chicken burrito. The burrito was pretty good. The chicken burrito was a bit dry. My friend had the chicken burrito with no sauce. She liked it."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I love coming to Majors, especially when the food is good. 

The food is always delicious and the service is always great. 

I think this place is going to be a regular stop for me. I will most likely be going back to try the other items on the menu.My wife and I went to the restaurant last"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Arrived around 9:00 had to wait an hour for a table.

The waitress was very rude.

I had the Chicken parm and my boyfriend had the Chicken Croquettes.

The chicken was dry and flavorless. The breading was mushy. The sauce was cold. The chicken was dry and flavorless."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"A great place to head out to eat. Great ambiance, nice staff, and a pretty good beer selection. Definitely a place to go to get a good meal.Great food and great service. We went on a Friday night around 8:30. The restaurant was very busy. There were a lot of people at the bar, but the bartenders"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The sesame shrimp is delicious. We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is very nice and the food is good.  The chicken salad is very good.  The fried rice is good.   The crab cake is very good.  The staff is very nice.  They have the best vegetarian option.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"If you don't mind spending $30+ for dinner and two drinks, this is the place to go.  The drinks are also great.  The staff is friendly and the food is great.  I would highly recommend this place.I've been going to this place for almost 3 years and it's always good. I've always had great service"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Food was good, cooked perfectly. Staff was friendly and helpful. I will definitely come back!Very good.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were good. I had a burger and fries. I did not like the"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"As we were passing through Tampa, the hostess decided to ask us how we wanted to eat. We ordered the burrito, a burrito with chorizo, a cheese tortilla, and a spicy margarita.  The burrito was very good. The cheese tortilla was a bit too spicy, and the chorizo was too"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food was really good, the service was very friendly and the drinks were really good. 

The only thing I would not recommend is the salad bar, the place is small but it's well worth the price. 

I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu.The service was great and the food was great!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Great pizzas here. Absolutely loved the flavors and the crust. I will definitely be back!Very good. We had the burrito and the eggplant parmigiana. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the eggplant was so fresh. The eggplant was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Excellent food very well prepared and interesting and inventive. Also very good service.  Very lively and fun place, perfect when the weather is good and the windows can be opened - but a bit noisy when they are closed. It has a really nice energetic atmosphere. We went last night and it was a great place to take an out of town visitor to show off the Philadelphia food scene."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"I have been there a few time, just because I work around here and not many options around, they always had a bad attitude! Today I saw a fly in the pho, and you know what the waiter said?! Get the fuck out of here! What's the fucking wrong with those people's mind! Unless you want to be pissed off and get nausea and disgusted! Don't even close to the store!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"While the food is generally good, the selection can be disappointing at times. I am rather picky when it comes to Chinese food, and considering the dearth of options in St. Louis, this is probably the one Chinese restaurant that I have visited the most often. It does get pretty busy on weekends, especially between 11:30 and 12:30. However, if you come before 11 or after 12:30, it's usually not bad."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Mushroom dip sandwich. OMG please give me more. Ended up stopping by here to catch up with some friends and watch the redskins kick some cowgirls but! Beer selection is good. The one thing I would've liked is to have the option to order off of the evening menu because I was really craving a burger. Other than that this place is a great place to just chill and lay back!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,A gem in the ruff - just walking into the tent started with a positive upbeat greeting from the host. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and helpful in deciding on the perfect burger and accompanying ale.  The waitress was just as cheerful and very attentive.  Our group chose 4 different burgers and they were all perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  The lobster burger was the bomb.
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"30 minutes exactly from check in to exit. Most of that time was spent waiting on the food, probably 15-20 minutes. Lots of employees including two that cleaned every table maybe thirty times. Long line at the drive thru and inside. I've never waited so long at any Burger King for fries and an original chicken sandwich, neither of which were hot or fresh tasting. Horrible location that needs management training."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"It is easy to find this place, right off route 70 in Marlton. Seated within 30 seconds (good) the near ELEVEN minute wait time FOR SOMEONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE US, NOT GOOD AT ALL. We had three individuals go by us at least a dozen times. And not one turned their heads. If you want to waste your time and be ignored this is the place for you."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Omg this place is friggin amazing! We are not really super- dedicated vegetarians but this is my all times fav veg place ( and honestly in the top 5 fav restaurants ever). We are foodies and quite spoiled with amazing food traveling between USA and Europe. but man this place. I dream about it! And the butterscotch dessert. it's to die for! Ambiance is just ok.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"After going to Italy on vacation earlier this year I was excited that an authentic pizza place was opening close by. I've been back multiple times going down the menu trying everything. My favorite thing about the pizza is that is delicious from edge to edge. The flavors are not masked by a mountain of cheese and the fresh ingredients really come to life in the oven. 
Definitely check it out."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Highly recommend bone marrow, I was chewing that bone like a dog. Then I had the endive, blue cheese and pear. Dinner was lamb shank and creamy polenta. I had a white wine to wash it all down. And topped it all off with the chocolate mousse. The entire thing cost me about $100 with tip but it was a awesome atmosphere, service was extremely classy, and the food was BOMB"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We popped in here for brunch! Heavy seafood options, which made it hard for my vegetarian wife to really digest the menu and find something she could eat.

On a positive note, they were more than willing to be accomodating and make her a special dish. But it wasn't advetersied and we had to ask, which is a less than a desirable situation. SOLID bloody Mary's - don't miss out on this."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,Diamond in the ruff. I am not super picky when it come to Mexican (except for chips and salsa). But babe this was good right here. I had a breakfast burrito (huge) and it was delicious!!! It was enough for me and my hubby to share. Check them out when you are in Reno. They are only open until 2pm so get there early. The owner is nice and hands on.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Loved this place! My sisters and mom and I came here for their AMAZING happy hour and had such a fun time. I mean, can you beat 5 dollar margaritas (which were huge, by the way!)?! The guacamole and salsa coupled perfectly with our drinks. Our wonderful server  Keenan made our experience so special. He was an excellent server who you could tell takes his job seriously."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"LOVED OUR DINNER   We had the crab cake and the shrimp & grits. Both were fantastic.  Great service and the food was amazing.  We will be back.I'm so excited to come back to this place. The food was great and the service was great. I had the 2 meat burger, the fries and the"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The Coffee House in downtown Tampa has the best coffee in Tampa. 

The staff is always friendly and the drinks are always hot. 

I love the place and it's definitely worth a stop. 

I will be back!Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in the Tampa Bay Area. I've been here about 10 times and"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I just called this place and asked if they had a good breakfast. When I got home, the owner said they had a bad breakfast. He then said he didn't have any other breakfast. I told him I'd just call the restaurant and ask if he could refund me. He said no. I told him I'd call them and they'll refund me"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I absolutely love Abe's. When I say I want to try something new, I mean I'm just going to try it. The food is delicious and the staff is always so friendly.I'm so excited to come here!  I've been coming here for years and it's always been a great experience.  I love the atmosphere and the food is"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Got there late on Sunday afternoon. The hostess was very rude and didn't seem to care. We waited for about 10 minutes for our server to come out. After about 20 minutes we asked for a menu and were told it would be about 15 minutes. After that we had to wait another 10 minutes to get our food. We waited another 10 minutes to
Restaurants,4.5,CG,So disappointed food is pretty good. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the service. The waitress was super nice and the food was good but the service was sooooo slow it was impossible to get her attention. She took forever to get our water and our food. The manager also took forever to come to our table and get our check.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Great lime green spot in Tampa. The food is good but it's also a little pricey. The atmosphere is great. The staff is friendly and the drinks are tasty. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table in the drive thru. This is a great spot for a quick lunch.The service was great and the food was great! The
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We were seated and were asked to wait an additional 15 minutes.  When we got our drinks we were given a very small plate of fries and then the server told us it was going to be a 45 minute wait.  We were told it would be 20 minutes.  The server said no problem.  We were then told it would be another 45 minutes
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Used to love this place, but the quality has gone down a lot since the last time we ate here. The food is always mediocre at best, the service is terrible, and the food is overpriced. It's a shame because this is one of our favorite places to eat.We love this place.  I've been here several times over the past"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Jumbo BBQ pork shoulder with a side of Mac and cheese.

The ribs were awesome and cooked perfectly. The sides were also great.  The mac and cheese was great as well.

The ribs were moist and tender. The Mac and cheese was good as well. The brisket was a little tough to eat and it was a little too"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,There was a time when this place was a favorite. I will admit that I have been there twice since then. The first time was with my boyfriend and we had a very nice time. The second time we were at a local coffee shop. This was our first time there. I had a coffee and a mimosa and it was very good.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,My sister and I were here last night with a group of 7 people for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere was great. The food was delicious and the service was great. The food was so good we had to take a break from eating. We ordered the gyro and the chicken sandwich. We all ordered the chicken sandwich and it was amazing.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Love this place. Cool atmosphere, great service. Great food.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was terrible. I went to go to a couple of friends and I was told it was going to be a 30 minute wait. We were told it was 45 minutes and it would be over an"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"For a new restaurant, my expectations were high. 

We were seated in the upstairs dining room. There was a small private room with a small TV and a TV for conversation. We were seated immediately and the server came over to ask if we wanted water. We ordered our drinks and were given our food. Our food was delivered within about 10 minutes"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,My wife is Vietnamese and she says this is one of the best Pho in Northern Nevada.  Her favorite is mi xao men with crunchy noodles.  The banh mi is not on the menu is also good.  We've been eating here for over 10 years now and would no hesitate in telling other Vietnamese to eat here.  Even my wife's friend also from Vietnam likes the food here.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Very solid food. I had a soup and salad combo with the potato soup and garden salad with Bleu cheese dressing. Others at the table had the chicken pot pie and the bourbon glazed salmon. Of course the complimentary honey butter croissants were delicious! Flaky crust with a buttery texture with the honey butter glaze. Some of the best croissants I have had in a long time! Our service was also excellent!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Ordered an americano, macchiato, and lavender molasses latte. Coffee flavor is good. Wished the lavender latte was a little stronger in flavor, but they did tell me it was meant to be more subtle. It it with oat milk. Kind customer service too! 

Also got the shaved ice here. It was tasty and the syrups were not jarringly sweet, but still had great flavor. 

Overall would come back here again! Definitely recommend."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've only ever gotten take out from here but every thing I've tried has been very good! My favorite so far is the chicken vermicelli and the spring rolls. The food tastes fresh and is prepared well.

I look forward to actually sitting down for a dinner there soon but since this isn't my husband's favorite type of food it looks like it will be take out for me in the near future!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Chose this restaurant based on good Yelp reviews and proximity to our location.  The service and ambiance were great. My pescado a la Veracruzana was as good as any I ever had in Mexico, or the USA for that matter. And the topping on the evening was a troupe of local Mariachis whose performance was pitch perfect. We have already nominated El Charro for our new favorite Mexican restaurant in Tucson."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food was amazing, service was on point and just perfect amount of attention.  Cute patio with fans and misters so it is very comfortable and inviting.  The best bar stools I have ever seen.  They put alot of money in doing this place right.  It has a great atmosphere for family and for partying.  I have made reservations to go back with a larger crowd of friends!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Normally a really decent bar given the area. Great selection of beers to satisfy anyone's needs. They definitely need to retool their take out staff because that long haired dweeb behind the counter is lacking serious people skills and doesn't understand the proper way to talk to a person trying to give them business. All the places in the area to grab and go I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere..
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Authentic. One of the best impressions of Indian street food I have had in the USA. Every dish we had was a winner. Its popularity with desi's is also a good indicator of its quality. They have a cafe like atmosphere and take out is quick. This probably sounds like i have been paid to write this and I wish it was the case, but really, this is bloody good curry mate"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Normally one of our favorite places, tonight there seemed to be no manager on duty. The waitresses were yelling across the dining room, yelling in the kitchen, swinging around the support poles. Our server was a young man and seemed to be the only one working instead of playing. My husband ordered the fajitas and there were no peppers, only wilted onions. Chicken was dry and over cooked. No quality control tonight."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was not really impressed with this establishment but, if your a beer drinker and you like a variety this is your place. Don't get me wrong this is a nice place but, the atmosphere was not very inviting. The food was okay but, I was expecting more from a gastro pub. I will try them again in the near future and see if I get a different feeling about this establishment."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The food is very good and the prices are reasonable but I would only get take out.  The sound inside in the restaurant is deafening.  It is so loud that you cannot hear other people talk.  If you sit out side it is quieter but not always comfortable because of the weather.  Most of the wait staff is great but there are the obligatory hipsters who are condescending.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We're having a staycation in Saint Pete for our anniversary. We've seen Casita Taqueria a few times but have never been. We decided to stop in and try it out and we were so happy we did. We both got two tacos a piece and shared chips, guac  and queso. Tacos had meat ranging from chicken, carna Asada, Barbacoa and shrimp. They were all delicious and we will definitely be back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My friend says that we were waiting for so long I feel like. And then she said Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha. But honestly I think my stupid funny attitude is fueled only by Americanized sushi restaurants. Did you order pizza for the dogs? No of course not he didn't it wasn't him, it will always be great sushi deals for two rolls and soup for $9."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Longtime fan of Wendys above other fast food joints, but this establishment is making me have to reconsider the quality of Wendys in general. Across 5 seperate visits, the food here has been poorly made and is always of low quality, especially low-quality for a Wendy's, considering the standard isn't that high to begin with. The service here ranges from alright to very friendly, however, so they have that going for them."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Love their fresh sushi, I had the mushroom curry and it was amazing. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great.

Restaurants,5.0,CG,I've driven by this restaurant a number of times and never had a bad meal. I order the chicken fried rice and the chicken tenders. The fried rice is tasty and flavorful. The chicken tenders are great. The chicken tenders are also very good. The chicken fried rice is also very good. I have also tried the fried rice and chicken teriy
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Very nice and spacious place.  The food was good but nothing special.  I would go back.  The drinks were good, but the food was not great.  I would like to go back and try something else on the menu.This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food is always good and the staff is very friendly and helpful."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,Really friendly staff; made great suggestions. The food was good but nothing special. The best thing about this place is the atmosphere. The food is good but the service is not great.I'm so excited to come back to this place. The food is amazing and the service is great. I love the food and the atmosphere! I will be coming back and recommending
Restaurants,2.0,CG,The service was abysmal. The server did not come to our table after we had already ordered and he was so rude.  The food was mediocre at best. The chicken was a bit dry but it was okay. The fries were a bit overcooked. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I did get the crab claws
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We had a great time. We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent. We ordered a burger and the fries. The burger was cooked to perfection. The fries were pretty good. The lettuce was not fresh. I would come back for the burger.The food was ok. We had a family of four and it took a while to get our
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Excellent dumplings and soup dumplings. We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is very friendly and helpful.  He is the best customer service I have ever experienced.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and it was great! I will definitely be back
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Love this place, the menu is amazing and the food is good. 

The only thing is that the service is a bit slow.  The server was not attentive at all and was just a little overwhelmed. 

I will be back. I will be back.I love this place. I have been going here for a year and have been"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Their website encourages you to go to the restaurant and try the food. There is a large menu. You can order the same thing over and over and have different choices. The food is great. The staff is very friendly. I would recommend it. This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we were very disappointed.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Hey as long been in Tampa, I've never been able to find a good BBQ joint that doesn't make me want to drive up to the city to find a good place. This place is a five star BBQ joint. I've been there for lunch and dinner and it's always been great. The place is clean and the staff is very friendly."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Come early! We came on a weekday and the line was pretty long. There were about 10 tables. We waited about 5 minutes for our food and then the server came to take our order. She came back and said we had to wait for our food. I asked for the manager and she said it's not our policy to take orders on the phone and bring
Restaurants,2.5,CG,This place has to have some real charm. It is a little on the pricey side but the food is so delicious. The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is so great.I'm so excited to come here!  I've been coming here for years and it always has been the best Thai food in town.  I've never had a bad dish here
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Excellent seafood, it was our first time there and got a sample of things. Their shrimp ceviche, garlic shrimp, clam chowder (was okay, but it was fresh) crab cakes and shrimp tacos. Everything was very tasteful. We will definitely make it back there. The views are to die for since it's right at the end of the pier. They have bar seating inside it's very small but the outside has tables. Great spot."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Nice selection of pizza by the slice. They really showcase their variety and it's so much easier to get a slice of something different than it is to waste money on a whole pizza that you may not like. Good cheesesteaks and fair prices. 
The service is quick and the wait is rarely long for food. It's my go to spot when I want a couple of slices or a good cheese steak."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Pretty decent place given that the airport doesn't have a full service restaurant.  To be honest, i coyld have made my own flatbread pizza for  a fraction of the cost.  But what do you do when traveling?  The buffalo chicken and Bacon flatbread was really tasty.   The bottom could have been crisper but overall it was good.   Just the price of $10 was the negative."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Had a reservation and was seated with my wife right away. This place was a lot more chaotic than it needed to be! Servers were running around all hurried and it does negatively effect the atmosphere of the place. Nice selection of drinks, and did get my scotch in a brandy glass, but the drink itself was fine. Food was decent, but atmosphere was lacking both due to very dated decor and chaos."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Good to come on a friday at 6pm. No wait. Won't say the same for Sat. This place parking is hard to find. So if you plan to come, come early or park far. Food is decent and we particularly like Taiwanese beef noodle. 1. Beef and beef tendon noodle 5/5. Soup is so tasty! 
2. Squid ball soup. 3. 8/5 
3. Oyster pancake 5. 5 
4. Tofu and veggie stir fry. Vegetables not too fresh."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Best place and people ever!! Every time I come to Rue I am overwhelmed by great people and an amazing atmosphere. Their gater bites, po'boys and calamari are so damn good!  This has always been a great place to come to work during lunch and their events throughout the week are great.  If you are looking for a place with an upscale menu without the snooty attitude, THIS IS YOUR PLACE!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"A great place to go for Mexican food in the Plymouth Meeting/Conshohocken area I absolutely love the chimichangas and the enchiladas suizas.  The food here is not too spicy, which is a positive in my book. It's also cheap, delicious, and you get a lot of it for your money.  Best part is they're open for lunch 7 days a week until 3 pm, and they have a large lunch menu."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Went on a Tuesday night bar hopped w my wife for her birthday ! Had 2 beers and a shot ! Sat inside they have a outside bar But it was kinda hot so we sat inside had a good time and the bartender was good. Been here a few times it's a really big place it never seems crowded. Over all a good place to come and have a few drinks !!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Phenomenal coffee at an exquisitely affordable price. Their cold brew on nitro was smooth and refreshing. This is saying a LOT from someone who is a coffee lover (coffee needer? same-same ;) and is from a city (PDX) where we live for coffee b/c we don't have that pesky ball of helium  in the sky as often as you fantastic Tampanians. Oh - and the folks there were class acts! Highly recommended!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"It has the potential to be a great spot, but it falls way short. The best thing going for it is the beer selection. Other than that, it's LOUD, one of the bartenders is a GRUMPY little bitch (it's a guy), and it smells like SEWER half the time (gross!). The food is only MEDIOCRE at best too. Guess I shouldn't have expected too much, considering it's the same owner as Nick's Pub..."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Good happy hour, but a little noisy for my liking. We couldn't hear each other talk at our table in the bar! Oh well, at least folks were laughing and having fun. Great selection of whiskey all posted on the wall. Happy hour food was a great value and pretty good. Next time, we will ask for a table in the restaurant side if we plan on talking to each other."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"A dive bar with good food and strong, yet difficult to down mixed drinks. Sports bar with chick waitresses and TVs everywhere. I loved the Chili Verde taco, and the Avocado taco was good. Everyone told me I had to try it. Prices are fair. Parking is easy. Definitely a good bar to start or end the night, but I think they close kinda early. Love the outdoor patio more than the inside."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"You know when a place has grabbed your heart and stomach when you are there back to back nights. I've tried the Jerk Chicken wings, the Jerk pork steak and the ackee and saltfish. Every dish was full of flavor and generous portions. The staff is so very friendly and welcome you when enter with a big ""hello"". I wish I could give more than five stars as this place is a keeper!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"1st time dinning here. I had the mushroom curry and it was fantastic. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the curry was so dry, and the noodles were very small. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and texture of the noodles. I also had the mushroom curry with the mushroom. It was really good and I would definitely order it"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Basic food that is not overly sweet and the portions are generous.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Regard Bonefish as a go-to, and the fried green tomatoes as my go-to. The fried green tomatoes are a nice, thick, crispy, and tasty. The fried green tomatoes are a little spicy, but good enough to keep you from going full on the meal. The fried green tomatoes are a nice side to the appetizer."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Lovely brewery in the center of downtown St. Louis. I visited on a Sunday around 8:30 pm and had the best time. There were four of us, so it was pretty packed.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,I've been eating at Gina's for a couple years now and I always love it. I order the chicken salad and it's amazing. The fries are crispy and seasoned just right. I've been to many other places and this one is by far the best. This is my new favorite place.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant and was
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I just tried the famous chicken wings and they were just ok. 

The wings were cooked perfectly and the sauce was nice and thick. The chicken was tasty and juicy. The wings were a little spicy and not spicy enough for me. I would come back for the wings. 

The place was clean and the owner was very friendly and gave us a"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Awesome QuikTrip. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Reno. The ambiance is awesome. It's not the best but it's good. The service is great. The food is amazing. I love the salmon taco salad. The tamales are very good. The queso is a must try. I will be back.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Very nice demeanor of owners and staff, the food is good, and the ambiance is awesome. I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little tough to eat and it was very chewy."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The bowls we got were huge and the quality was amazing.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was terrible. I was sitting at the bar and the bartender was so rude that it took forever to get my drink order. I had to ask for my money back because I was getting my food and I was"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is possibly the most beautiful place I've ever been to.  There is a large outdoor seating area and the inside is very bright.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  We had a reservation and we were seated in a very short time.  The food was very good.  The chicken and waffles were wonderful.  The chicken was tender and the
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is a great place for an intimate dinner. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is fast and friendly. The place is clean and the staff is always smiling. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area.I've been going to this place for almost 3 years and it's always good. I've always had great service and great food.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food is quite tasty, especially the mushroom curry. The service is friendly and attentive. I recommend the gnocchi. The gnocchi is crispy, not chewy, and has a nice sauce. The gnocchi is fresh and flavorful. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I will definitely be back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Everyone raves about this place, but I thought it was pretty good. The cheese steak was pretty good. The mac and cheese was alright. Not great, but not bad either. The only thing that was disappointing was the fact that it came with some kind of gravy that was not supposed to be gravy. I was hoping the gravy would be a little more flavorful."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We tried everything...ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Picked up the rib and all the meat completely  fell off!  Delicious!  Good flavor, no one overwhelming spice.  Meat was tender, juicy and everything you want in  BBQ.  One thing that really stood out was the friendly service. They offered to let us try some sides and even offered to replace one when they noticed my son wasn't eating his."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Had the breakfast buffet on a Saturday morning, food was not fresh- pancakes and waffles were hard on the edges, and fruit was not great. WORST PART- we went up to get our food and a waiter sat someone at our table!! Theres no communication between the hostess and waiters.  

The view is good, service and food= over priced for what you get.  My pancakes at McDonalds were better the following day."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Never really went to Eat a Pita but once they updated to include poke I had to try it- and I am glad I did! I am picky with my poke and only like the freshest fish. Jimmys has very fresh fish. The bowl sizes are perfect, not too big but not too small. But above all, I was impressed by the customer service. Will definitely be retuning here to get my poke fix!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Outstanding is the word I'd give this place. The food is amazingly delicious, the Korean double fried wings, yes please, and the Curry Laska, hell yeah. I went to the Orlando one a few months ago and came across another one here in St. Pete. Now they need to open one in Atlanta (a great foodie town). They would dominate over the competition there. Hawkers, if you're reading this, set your course for Atlanta!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The soft shell crab is great and the rest of the sushi we ordered was good.  Otherwise, as long as you have 2 hours available for dinner, this is a solid sushi restaurant to visit.  The main reason for the 3 stars is the amount of time we waited.  Service was beyond slow (about 20 minutes for 2 cups of water and then another hour for the sushi to come out)."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"We had lunch at this place on Thursday and it was great! The cheese steaks were delicious and the customer service was awesome! We met the owner and she was very welcoming. We told her that we had also ordered delivery the night before, and their pizza was really good. The store was clean and the wait for our food was well worth it.  

We will definitely be ordering from this place again!!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Just your average bar with very opinionated older gentlemen surrounding the bar arguing with one another.  Ordered a turkey club on the pretzel bread, turkey was cut thick but dry as was the bread.  The sweet potato fries were good and the server was quick to refill drinks.  Don't think I would go back unless a group of people just wanted to grab a drink and an app to snack on."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,finally my restaurant in nashville. the place I'll always go. my second living room with a bar. GREAT cocktails. but it's the food. it's just plain excellent. all pastas made in house. the seafood squid ink and pork ragu garganelli were my favorites. we went twice the first week and pretty much ate through the menu. great vibe. great service. but it's the food. really. peasant food with a modern twist. inspired. truly. go.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The seafood pistolettes were recommended as an award winning appetizer and they did not disappoint! Very tasty and a hearty appetizer. The rest of the menu looked great, but we weren't that hungry so we had a progressive dinner evening. 

Lovely historic interior and just blocks from the madness that's Bourbon St. That's a plus if you want to step away from the chaos and a bonus if you want to head there afterwards."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"So disappointed. Been meaning to try breakfast here for quite a while and finally did. Was not very busy and have no complaints about server taking our order. My issue is that everything was cold,  and when the side of bacon came later it was cold too. The food would have been average if it had been warm, but as it was cold, it was returned uneaten. Once was enough for this place."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My husband and I went there brunch time, we were disappointed to know that they only serve brunch on weekends. So we shared the steak salad and ordered the Rigatoni entree and the grilled cheese sandwich. We ordered the steak medium but was served to us medium rare. The pasta was undercooked and not salted enough. The cheese sandwich was pure tasteless grease. 
The waitress tho was kind and the restaurant patio is beautiful."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is our favorite Sushi restaurant! We love the half off specials they are continuing to do with takeout. We usually order the spicy tuna roll,, tuna roll, California Roll etc. have never had any of the sushi anything less then fresh.
We had hibachi here once before Covid, and we loved it. Can't wait for restaurants to open back up so we can do it again.
Def. try this place out if you haven't already!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Amazing. Short ribs and BLT's are a must have. I'd go back just for the BLT--the ""t"" is a fried green tomato, delicious. The fries and salads are fresh and the beers are awesome. If you don't know what delicious, homemade beer to try, get the sampler! 7 beers, 48 oz total for only $12....AMAZING. Awesome, modern atmosphere, great service, unique view of the trains and the railroad and outdoor seating. Definitely going back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We had Thanksgiving dinner at Gray & Dudley and it did not disappoint. It was a great selection of turkey and side dishes. The Brussels sprouts were my favorite dish. The service was outstanding and the restaurant was quiet. We arrived about 15 minutes ahead of our reservation and were seated right away. The desserts were fair but the cheesecake was somewhat dry. Overall I enjoyed the meal and will return to the restaurant.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Absolutely loved this place. Decorated and decorated well. Great ambiance. We had a reservation and the place was extremely busy. The place was packed and we had to wait a while for a table. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and portions were large. The only downside was that the service was slow.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,The food is good but not amazing.  We ordered the shrimp and grits and the crawfish.  The shrimp and grits were good but the crawfish was a little undercooked.  We also ordered the shrimp and grits.  The shrimp and grits were not the best.  The grits were fine but the shrimp and grits were a little
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Stopped in for lunch on a weekday and the food was good.  Service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  I will definitely be back!I have to say I was very disappointed. I ordered the salmon and I am very disappointed. I was expecting some great salmon but the salmon was very dry and the seasoning was very lacking. The salmon was very tast
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Wasn't crazy about this place. We had the crab cakes which were really good, the potato salad and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was also really good, the crab cake was nice and crispy and the gnocchi was fresh and buttery. I also had the short ribs which were a bit dry but I guess it's a sign of the season"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Hey everyone! tonight at 9:45pm, my husband and I decided to go to dinner for the first time. We had reservations for 8 people, but since we had reservations, we decided to go to the bar. 

We waited a bit for our server to come to our table. He was a bit slow with our order and seemed to be overworked"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is probably the best BBQ place I've ever been to. 

The brisket is a favorite.  The sides are also good. 

This place is pretty small, so parking can be a challenge.  If you are going to drive to the parking lot, make sure to bring a reservation!  I usually get the pulled pork with a side"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,This restaurant is 100% VEGAN. We have been here many times and it's always great! We always order the two meat burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito is huge and filling. It's a large burrito and it is very filling. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a great meal and great service
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I used to love this place. The food is just ok. The service is terrible. The servers are so rude. The food is mediocre at best. The chicken salad is okay. The chicken is tough and bland. The salad dressing is terrible. My boyfriend gets the chicken salad and it is a 2 piece with a side of greens. The chicken is not cooked to perfection
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Stopped here on my way back to the airport and decided to try it out. I was pretty impressed. The food was delicious. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and great. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fry was on the cold side and the fries were not crispy. We also ordered the spicy chicken and it was good but the chicken was tough and"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We are not even hungry, so I just order a few bites. The food is good. The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty. I've been to many other bars and restaurants that have a good beer selection. The food is good. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Totally fantastic - this is a place you want to try if you are in the area! 

The food is amazing. The mussels and the mussels are great. The rice is soo good. The shrimp and grits are some of the best I've had. I love the fried green tomatoes. I also love the sweet potato fries."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Hubby and I ate here last night and the food was good.  The cheese steak was awesome.  The mac and cheese was alright.  The salad was okay.  The mac and cheese was okay.  The salad was fresh and it was warm and tasty.  The staff was great.  I will definitely be back.I had the crab cake with a
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We discovered Ground via yelp and it was the best burger I've ever had. I was pretty disappointed. The burger had a lot of flavor and the sauce was tasty. The fries were ok. They had no seasoning. The burger was good. I would come back to try their other burgers.We ordered the chicken nachos and the guacamole.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Traveling & stopped for a quick bite and a quick bite of NOLA. I was pretty impressed. 

The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside seating. There were some tables with paper tables and chairs. I think it's a nice place to go if you are in the area. "
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Best pizza in St. Louis. I live in Chicago and Pi is one of my favorite options for deep dish. The regular crust (what Midwesterners call thin) is good too, especially if you're trying to tackle a pie alone. Kale-ifornication is an outstanding salad, although sometimes the toasted chickpeas hurt my teeth. Downtown and Delmar Loop locations have consistent food quality and friendly service. Slightly prefer the bar atmosphere at the downtown location for dinner."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've came here twice and had chicken cheesesteaks both times, and it tasted just as awesome as it did last time! The portion size is pretty big, although my sandwich was about $11. The prices are a little steep so it was like I just paid for a very expensive sandwich. Since I'm not from Philly I can't speak on whether it's the best cheesesteak, but overall it's a pretty good bang for your buck!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Country Café is a lovely place to visit with very kind people. However, the kitchen and eating area really needs a good cleaning. It's quite dirty, yet they make the most lovely food. I believe, if they were to do a good haul out of everything, updating and cleaning, this little spot would give the Loveless Café a run for its money.

One piece of advice, bring cash. They do not accept debit or credit cards."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Our friends in Nashville recommended this restaurant, as my kids wanted spaghetti and we didn't want to go to a chain. We all LOVED it. I had lasagna, which was perfect, and my kids loved the spaghetti. For a larger group, you can get the ""mafia"" booth which is dark and tucked in the back. My kids loved that, too. Everything here looked good, and if I lived in Nashville, we'd definitely be going back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great place and value! Staff is nice !(: I've been here a few times and it's been a great experience every time. My friend got a burrito, and I got a bowl. I like to choose the sushi rice mixed with the salad as my base and then add spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and literally all of the toppings. The food quality has always been fresh to me which is why I keep coming back!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Service was mediocre, three waitresses came by to get our drinks and on the third try they got it. The shaved noodles were my favorite, but the sauce wasn't great. The eggplant for an appetizer is amazing, especially if you can add the shaved noodles to it. The hand pulled noodles were good but the shaved noodles were better. Also this place is cash only but luckily they have an ATM right at the door."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My first experience here wasn't great but they have more than made up for it in my several subsequent visits. 

Tonight was no exception. We sat at the bar ordered a few drinks and the nachos. The drinks were fast and the nachos unbelievable, especially for the price (seriously, these things are a hidden gem, for $7 my boyfriend and I split them and are both miserably full). Everything was clean and everyone was hustling."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Lack luster to say the least.... My boyfriend (who apparently was smitten with the bacon) even was highly disappointed on the second visit. All interior appearances aside (which was lacking as well) the food was nothing short of BAD. I got the biscuits and gravy and I've had better while I was in military Dining Facilities. They were: Dry, cheap, and over all looked like they came out of a box at Wal-Mart. Painfully dissatisfied."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We walked into the store and three employees were verbally fighting over something while there were at least 4 families waiting for their food and making a complete scene in the middle of the MOD. On top of that we were waiting in line for almost 10 minutes when there were only 2 people in front of us in line so we just decided to go somewhere else. Horrible vibe and long wait very disappointing.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Just finished the Meathead. First off they need to add more sauce to the pizzas. The sauce that was on it wasn't  very good. I liked the thin crust however. Service was lack luster at best. Learn to smile people!!  Also please don't waste your dollar and 30 and buy those deceivingly beautiful cookies they're horrible!! For the out of towners who have a hankering for pizza I would advise to look elsewhere.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"awww MAN this place is incredible! Good to hear it's still open!

The burgers are delicious. The root beer is delicious. The potato planks however are OFF THE CHAIN! A big basket of thinly sliced fried potato topped with delicious things like cheese sauce, sour cream, and bacon bits? Sign me UP!

I haven't been to this place in 10 years unfortunately, but you better believe I will be there on my next visit to St."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,Waited in line at the drive through forever then they told me yo drive around to the front for my food. Waited another 10 minutes got my order but it was missing some items. So had to go in the store and complain and finally got what I had ordered. Don't get the jalapeño poppers. $3 for three tiny little ones. Not worth the money. Were not very good. Anyways bad service and blah food.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Was really excited to try this place. Food smelled great while waiting for pickup. However, I noticed mice droppings where the food was being prepped, not to mention  one of the workers was touching food with their BARE HANDS. Gross at any time of year, let alone flu season! I didn't want to cause a scene since I already paid, but I wound up ditching the whole order in a trash can on Girard."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Perfect  wedding venue for Santa Barbara feel. Great food, drink, and fresh tortillas. Prices are exceptionally reasonable if you don't need a Saturday night wedding. General Mgr. pleasant to work with. Room with dance floor was slightly crowded  to maneuver with 130 people , but has a spacious feel with high open retractable ceiling and live trees .
Location is a central and beautifully maintained historic site with Casa de la Guerra just adjacent."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I thought I had a better meal at the bar. I saw a lot of people eating and we sat down. The place was packed and the place was crowded. The food was mediocre at best. It was good, but nothing special. I don't know how many people were eating at the bar, but it was a pretty loud place."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Well you can call and order an appetizer, you can ask for a side of bread, and you can order the dessert. The food is delicious! I think the place is pretty small, but it's not too bad.I came here for lunch with my family. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,Worst food ever there was a bunch of pieces of fried chicken in a tiny bag. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and the waffles had a lot of rice. The only thing I'd say is that they need to re-make the chicken. The wings were a bit dry but I guess it's just me.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Mahana Fresh has the potential to be the best Indian restaurant in town. The ambiance is awesome. The food is very good. The service is excellent. The food is great. The portions are huge. The prices are good. The place is very clean and friendly.The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the lamb gyro and it was excellent.
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"My kids love ihop. This is a great place to stop for a snack or a drink. 

The food is delicious. The fries are crispy, seasoned, and great. The burgers are good. 

The staff is friendly and helpful. This is a great place for a quick lunch.I have to say I have to give this place a high rating"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I LOVE MOKABE'S!!! Not only are they the best, they're also THE BEST in the city! The BEST burger in the city. The fries are crispy, and the bun is light and fluffy. The only complaint is that the burger is a little soggy for my taste. The fries are a bit soggy, and I'm not sure"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My sister and I frequent this place and the food is good.  However, the service has been terrible.   The food is mediocre and the drinks are not good either.  We go here twice a week.  I would not recommend it.   I ordered the churro and it was very bland and flavorless.  The steak was cooked medium well and"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Yum! In store or take-out...Extremely friendly staff and the food is good. 

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The sauce is thick and flavorful. 

The only reason this is not 5 stars is because the food was not great. The place was packed and it took a while"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I love my coffee. But I don't like my coffee. And I don't like the coffee. And I don't like the money. I don't like the fact that I get charged $2 for a shot of espresso. I don't like the fact that I have to wait 30 minutes for a shot of espresso.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My girlfriend is Filipino and this place is the best. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but that is the only reason I gave 4 stars.The food was great. The server was nice and attentive. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I got the fried oyster appetizer and it was so good"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Called ahead of time to order a pizza and they told us it would be ready in 20 minutes. We waited an additional 45 minutes, before they said it would be ready. When it did arrive, it was cold. The pizza was extremely cold. My boyfriend got the pizza and it was cold. The only thing I ate was the meatballs."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I will get straight to the point, the food is good, but the service is slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I go there is because of the good reviews. I've been going to this place for almost 3 years and it's always good. I've always had great service and great food."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"3 1/2 stars. Thought this was an easy mistake. We've eaten at this location a few times. We always order the same thing, both the fried chicken and the Mongolian beef. The chicken is fried and the beef is seasoned perfectly. The rice is very good as well. The only downside is that the service is slow. We waited about 10-15 minutes"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went for the views which were beautiful a good view of city lights. They were short staffed but pleasant. Nice open space with picnic tables, couches and typically chairs. The drinks were not so hot, I wouldn't come for the drinks. The food though was delicious! I highly recommend the steak tacos omg the flavor and fresh pico! The fried chicken sliders were good as well. Clean bathroom. It's a nice experience it's worth a visit."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We come to Umami usually twice a month and absolutely love it. The sushi is always fresh and the rolls are creative and flavorful. Tonight they surprised us with a beautiful presentation which included an ice sculpture and a fresh rose. We were very impressed! Not a special occasion, just a regular Saturday night date night. I am surprised that their ratings aren't higher on here. It is definitely our favorite sushi spot in the area."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This may be the most tasteless pizza I have ever had. Toppings were unequally spread on the pizza and minimal. Also we had a plate of pasta and the sauce was incredibly spicy.
The customer service was really not special at all. There was an older man who was obviously unhappy to be there as he angrily cleaned tables and delivered the pizzas to the table.
For the overpriced pizza, I was not happy with the overall experience."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"A couple girls and I stopped here for dinner while visiting Santa Barbara and we were thoroughly impressed and satisfied! The ambiance is calming and enjoyable and the noise level is extremely low making conversation simple. Everything is reasonably priced. I had a pizza de treviso and it was delicious but so big! All 3 of us had leftovers, all the entrees are definitely shareable. The garlic bread is amazing too!! I would reccomend for sure!"
Restaurants,5.0,OR,Cutest donuts ever! We are big goofs and immediately broke into song C is for cookie that's good enough for me. The Cookie Monster donut is our favorite. I have no idea healthy and donut could go together. I'm really not sure the secret. They are super moist. Maybe pumpkin? But does not taste like pumpkin.. just super soft and delicious. The Cookie Monster donut has the perfect amount of sprinkles to add to it's deliciousness.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The guava pastries are my all-time favorite. And I don't even like pastries, as a rule.

A few pro-tips:
- Cakes need to be ordered two weeks in advance.
- Their website has some contact-by-email options. DON'T. (You probably won't get a response.) Just show up.
- Some staff speak English, but not all. However, if your Spanish isn't fluent enough to (for example) order a cake in, odds are that a friendly fellow customer will happily translate for you."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Just had lunch at FirePoint Grill in NEWTOWN Square and it was excellent! The food was great, the service was excellent. Staff was attentive and friendly. I love the menu, and the space was interesting. I would describe it as modern art deco meets industrial warehouse. It's quite big! I can't wait to try it for dinner! If this new restaurant can keep up this level of expertise I expect it to be a great success!"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,Rosie's used to be a great place to grab a bite but ever since new management has taken over the place has tanked. The food is always overcooked - the last Awful Awful I had was incinerated- the portions are never the same and tonight we've been sitting here for 50 minutes and when the food showed up both orders were wrong. We've been regulars for years but I think it's time to find another place.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I wouldn't hesitate to say these guys serve the best pies I've had in the Sunshine State. I'm one of the firm believers that the crust and sauce make the pizza and this restaurant has perfected both. They've hit the nail on the head with their ingredients, portion sizes, and prices. Their garlic knots are out of this world and the salads are also worth trying. The only quarrel I had was finding a parking space."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We walked out of the Sea Turtle restaurant down the road due to horrible customer service and ended up here at the Waffle House. We were immediately greeted by one of the cooks when we walked in. Then a server quickly seated us. Her name was Jaz and she was very friendly and efficient. The food was good and at a  good price.  I recommend this place for fast, courteous service and good food!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I love this place it is amazing. The staff here is very friendly and accommodating . R went here a few days ago and it was full of people which means that it is good. I ordered a burrito and it was done just right. Last time I had a burrito they put too much cheese and sour cream at chipotle. The burrito was light in the sour cream and cheese . I love coming here.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great atmosphere, lemongrass-chili wings were delicious and not overly soaked in sauce had just the right amount of bite, the pho was hearty and the broth was really well made.  Curry was sweet but with a nice kick served with bread or rice went with both due to hunger and was not disappointed. Server was polite and food came out promptly. Overall an excellent meal wings definitely one of the best parts would highly recommend."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Well decorated, nice bar with TVs and dining on other side.

Ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp, and peanut chicken - both were good overall, not great.
Girlfriend ordered the tofu and was happy with it, I also liked it!

Service was good overall, and prices were okay.

Nothing exceptional, but no major complaints either.

*UPDATE* Came back and tried the General chicken, egg fried rice and the spring rolls - all were great!

Staff was very friendly just as our first visit!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Went to pegs this morning and it was the best fried chicken I've ever had! I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious and crispy! The chicken was great and the waffles were awesome. It was a little pricey for what it is but worth it. The staff was great and they were very quick to take our order. I will definitely be back!
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Best Mexican in St Charles.  The food is amazing.  The service is excellent.  The atmosphere is great.  The food is also fantastic.  This place is definitely worth a try.  If you're looking for a good Mexican experience, come to El Camino!This is a great place for a date night. The food is amazing and the service is great."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place is very cool, and has the best food in Nashville. 

The food is really good. The burrito is a solid 4 out of 5, and the guacamole is awesome. It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it. 

The service is great. I'm pretty sure the owner is a manager,"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This was our first time here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place. The food is good, but the service is not."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Ole Smoky is part tourist/part tourist trap, with the exception of the parking lot in the back. The building is small, and the food is good but the service is not great. The food is mediocre at best. The food is fresh, and the service is friendly.The food was amazing and the prices were very reasonable!  We had the crab cakes and the"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,No idea how I came here. The food was ok but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We will never come back to this place.I had the crab cake with a side of past
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've eaten at every Brazilian restaurant in the US and this is the first one I'd go back to.  The drinks are great, the food is great, the service is great, and it's a great place to go for a drink.  This is my new favorite place for Brazilian food.  I'm also going to be a regular here and it's a great place"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Bruh, the low star reviews here have me wondering if they're all just for the high prices. 

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection. It was served on a bed of rice and topped with some veggies. The texture of the chicken was very good and the flavor was very fresh. 

"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Love this place for its location. The food is amazing. The drinks are great too. If you like a good beer and don't want to get the flavor of a sports bar, this place is for you. Just be prepared to wait. If you're hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer than your normal time. The food is good and cheap too."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Impeccable service. My companions ordered the meatballs with sausage and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Both were delicious. The sausage was the best I have ever had. The sausage was cooked perfectly and it was well seasoned. The pulled pork sandwich was also very good. The meatballs were not the best I have ever had, but it was good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Overall just meh as far as the service. We ordered two pizzas for 2 people and one to go. The pizza was cold, the cheese was okay and the sauce was okay. We had to ask for the manager to check on the pizza. This was our first time coming here and we felt bad about it. I understand it's a tourist place and I'm looking forward"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Always a fun experience to go to and the food is good. 

The only thing is that the service is a bit slow.  The server was not attentive at all and was just a little overwhelmed. 

I would recommend this place and will be back.I love this place. I have been going here for a year and have never had a bad meal."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We came the morning of the 9th and we were greeted by a lovely waitress. We ordered the gnocchi and the Chicken parmigiana. The chicken parmigiana was cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was fresh and flavorful. The gnocchi was also very flavorful and a generous portion for the price. We also had the crab cake with a buttery crust
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Excellent BYOB in Conshy! You are missing out if you have not been here before. We passed the cafe upon moving to the area and we're delighted to have dinner on a Saturday evening. The atmosphere was relaxed yet sophisticated and reminded my husband and I of our honeymoon in France. The service was also wonderful and the food was amazing--a good selection of classic French dishes prepared with love and attention to detail.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I enjoy ordering delivery from Giovani's, fortunately I live only a few blocks away.  I like the chicken parm sandwich and the sweet potato fries.  The pizza looks really good too and I'm eager to try it sometime.  The service is friendly and the price is good, reasonable and affordable.  I have never eaten inside, only ordered delivery but it looks like a fun place to try. I will definitely use them again!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Best dog I've ever put in my mouth! The pimento cheese dog was to die for.I don't normally eat bread but the bun was totally worth the carbs. The staff is friendly and even gave us a map of the area recommendations on where we should visit. Funky and fun decor and outdoor seating. Planning to go back tomorrow for Sunday lunch before leaving town. A must try. But be warned, the cravings afterwards will be intense."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We come to SB twice per year and we visit The Sandbar at least twice each stay. We LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The servers are friendly, the drinks are amazing, the appetizers are awesome and the food is fantastic!

Imagine our heartbreak when we arrived and found it temporarily closed.... AAAAGH! PLEASE open again soon Sandbar. We already miss you.

UPDATE:
The Sandbar is open again and just as fantastic as before!  Keep up the fantastic work, Sandbar!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Been about three years since I last had their food and it has not changed. Egg foo young was ok,Fried Chicken wings were Overcooked,Unchanged Oil/Burn't oil. same ""Kid' behind counter (order taker) appeared ""High"". Very poor English ,even after years of dealing with people. I Will NOT go back to China Wok in Gallatin ,Until new Ownership or Management takes over. Wings were a waste of 5.95 + tax. Very surprised they are still in Business !"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"One of the absolute best Mexican restaurants in SB! Santo Mezcal offers classic dishes with a modern twist, giving it quite the flare. Service was excellent, food was delicious, and drinks were tastefully bold (the blood orange margaritas are bomb). This place definitely lives up to its raving reputation and I will be coming back soon! 

Pro tip: Because they don't offer reservations, be sure to put your name in at the front before you are starving!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was on business in PA and craving Indian.  
Took a look around an made the drive to the Guru from Horsham.
Definitely worth the drive.  These guys made me feel like home.  Quick service. 
Food was really tasty without being overpowering.  Chicken Masala was very tender.
Bring your own bottle of wine and they will pour it.  In my case the owner was nice enough to share her own wine stash with me."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Had a killer lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Nice little spot on Fairmount st. Patio seating as well as some indoor spots. We all ordered paninis. Everyone loved their meal. I had the special - jerk chicken. I substituted the provolone for sharp provolone. Great sandwich. Gf had the San Diego. Chicken, sharp provolone, roasted red pepper and pesto. Served on a panini roll. Also very good. We will definitely go back to try more! Eat it!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Had a DELICIOUS and FUN Friday afternoon at Jack Rose with my out-of-town guests!!  Food is picture perfect...and tastes even better than it looks. The FRIED chicken parmesan with fresh pasta is unlike anything else in the city.  The staff is also wonderful -- treats you like old friends, not like customers.  They were also very patient with my niece, who had more fun than any of us.  Thank you, Emery and Brian!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We decided to stop in one late afternoon for some dosas. The Indian guy was rude and unfriendly. After placing our order we looked around for a table, when my husband requested a table be cleaned near the window, he was ignored even though he was heard.
Now the food, the worst we have had. Well that was the first and last time we were there. Oh and I come from India and know how food should be."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"All I can really say is that they make a good sandwich. It's a good size and good flavor. I drove 20 minutes out of my way to give them a try and I wasn't disappointed. Nice little shop with a decent variety. Can't have a good hoagie without a good roll, and theirs are great. Prompt and friendly service and priced right. Their not the best hoagies in my opinion but they are better than most."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The wait service here is very good especially with larger groups. We went for lunch with about 12 people and were seated almost immediately with plenty of space! The bread they bring out is always delicious, although I think they now charge for more than one roll per person... not entirely sure though. But I ordered a large pizza and it came out pretty fast considering that there was so many of us and was absolutely delicious!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I am not sure what happened today but I went to get my usual afternoon snack and the doors were closed and I asked the person if they were closed and he said we close at 3:45.  It was 3:20 and I asked him when they started to close early.  He said since I have been working here.  

Please change the website information to reflect the correct hours.  Otherwise, you will loose customers."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Ordered through GrubHub, estimated delivery time to be 15 min. I arrived around 5:30pm and was told that the restaurant is closed, but that they have a ""good"" lunch hour. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh, hot, hot and delicious. I had the mixed greens, which were excellent. I added a side of crab cakes and they were"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I wouldn't call myself a sushi connoisseur. I'm not one of those people. I'm a sushi connoisseur. I think this place is pretty good. It's pretty standard in the area, and it's pretty cool to see people coming in and out. The place is pretty clean and has a pretty big dining area."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Every local we talked to, a local, and a local who lived close by, recommended the place. The food is great, and the staff is very friendly. I would definitely go back. It's a great local place. This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food is excellent, the service is fantastic and the atmosphere is very relaxed."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Upstairs has a nice desk area with a wide variety of seating.  There is a large bar area with two small tables and a couple chairs.  The bar area is great for large parties.  We sat at the bar which was very clean.  The food was very good.  We had the duck with a side of cornbread and the crabmeat with a side of mashed
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Went for lunch with a group of friends. We ordered two pizzas, a salad and a pizza. The pizza was delicious. The salad was crispy, not too greasy and had a nice crisp. The pizza was good, but nothing special. My friend got the pizza and said it was a bit too spicy. I did get a salad, but it was a salad with lettuce"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"First time here and it was an amazing experience. We started with a salad, the charbroiled oysters and the crab cake, both were fantastic! Then we had a dessert, the dessert was a little on the bland side, but it was delicious and filling. We also had the fried cauliflower and chocolate cake, both were fantastic. The service was great and the food came out"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Found this amazing locally owned and operated bakery with a friendly staff. 

The fruit cupcakes are so delicious. The bakery itself is beautiful and the staff is so friendly. The cakes are made in house and they are so fresh. They are made with fresh ingredients. The staff also makes a special place for their customers. I love the fact that they are a family owned business."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I was here for a weekend brunch and the food was good. The waitress was nice and we sat down at the bar. We ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious. We also ordered the smoked turkey biscuit and it was very good. The staff was very nice. I highly recommend it. I had a very good experience here.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Who knew that a side of sweet potato fries could make a smoothie that didn't make you sick? 

If you're looking for some quick, tasty, and cheap, this place is a great choice.  I'd come back for the smoothie next time I'm in the area.The service was great and the food was great! The owner was so sweet and made"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The spring rolls were good, but not the best I've had in a while. I would recommend the fried tofu. 

Service was good, the waitstaff was attentive and courteous. 

The food was fresh and delicious. I'd come back.Great food, great service. 
The food is always good and the service is always excellent. 
"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We were excited to try this place, but we weren't expecting anything spectacular. I was disappointed. We ordered the burrito, which was good but the flavor was not great. The rice was soggy and the beans were not flavorful. I ordered the seafood combo and it was also not good. I ended up going with the pork taco, which was good but nothing special."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Outstanding! Griffy Sticks are an absolute must visit!!We decided to try this place for the first time. We had reservations and it was a bit difficult to get a table. The restaurant was nice and clean. The service was good and the food was good. I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the fish and chips. The food was good and I think
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Celebrated my Goddaughter's 19th birthday here. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a Brie dish. The Brie was the bomb. It was cooked perfectly and it was so fresh. The shrimp were fresh and moist. My husband had the shrimp and grits and it was delish. I had the pork chop and it was so
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Pre-made fast food at fine dining prices.  We (2 people) spent $80+ for lunch to sample several dishes and were Very disappointed.
The curry was extremely salty with slices of pre-cooked low quality beef.  The two noodle dishes were bland and chewy with pre-cut veggies.  
Additionally, the staff was more interested in talking amongst themselves than waiting on the customers.  Too bad as Brentwood/Franklin area needs a good clean Thai restaurant.  We'll keep looking."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Normally I give places the benefit of the doubt and understand that they are teenagers working so I disregard a lot when it comes to professionalism. However this location is not following proper safety guidelines during Covid. I witnessed employees talking without masks and without gloves assembling the boxes that's customers food was being put into. This type of negligence when it comes to safety especially during a pandemic is just unacceptable and management needs to take responsibility.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Good food.  Terrible service.  Throughout the entire meal, the waitress we had made it feel as if she was doing us a favor by waiting on us.   She spent the whole time chatting it up in the back with the manager and other wait staff.  The most attention she gave us was when she delivered the check,  of course.  Can't stand those type of servers.  Get it together Tre Luna!"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"David, our server and the bartender, busted his behind all night. It was a busy Saturday night and the outside deck filled, so he got hit with the overflow all at once. This bob-cut blonde manager walked around looking at her phone, bypassing empty glasses and dirty plates at the end of tables as her employees were crippled under the weight of the flow of business. That's not management, nor leadership. Thank you, David, for your service tonight."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This was our first time at this restaurant and it won't be our last. What a fabulous meal it was. Great wine, service, generous delicious bread and impeccable meal from appetizer to dessert. I would highly recommend this restaurant. It's important to note that I don't eat just anywhere. I have very high standards because I'm a good cook myself.  Make a reservation!  Oh yes, I forgot to mention the wonderful bar with a great selection."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Food was awesome. Loved the Guac. Our waitress was the worst.  Her attitude was rude and very disrespectful. She actually was so annoyed at us that she dropped our plates down on the table beause we asked for silverware and an extra sauce.....she definitly showed us that she would like to be anywhere else than working. We went for my daughters birthday dinner and left so unsatisfied. Its amazing how one young woman  ruined our experience.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Its a great addition to the neighborhood and the breakfast food and coffee is great. I went both saturday and sunday of the opening weekend.  It's the first weekend so ill give them the benefit of the doubt, but they need to work on the register/ordering situation.  Its painstakingly slow to wait in line for simply a coffee or ordering food. Also please consider extending saturday breakfast past 10:30 if possible.  Only Mcdonalds does that."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Yeah... nope. I really don't like the fact that no one knows how to make a decent cup of coffee. I even ended up switching to vanilla chai, and the powder they used was caked to the bottom of the cup. The fryer is also broken at the moment, so you can't order fries which is basically the only reason why I'd come here for lunch. If only there were better places to get coffee on this campus...."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The food was fantastic, but the service lacked direction. The hostess literally told me that no one was helping her out and that she had to set the table. It made me feel bad for her, but at the same time that shouldn't be shared with a paying customer. Once again, food was fantastic but the staff needs an adjustment. Lack of guidance and leadership- management. Sorry, for the two but it's important to feel taken care of."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Finally found a Thai restaurant in boise. Place was packed with large people. Typical of idahoans.  
The menu did not have sticky rice , did not have Chile jam squid , did not have tilapia , many things that should be on a Thai menu.  But at least they had Singha beer.  Items we ordered were very good. But also salty. Just couldn't get enough water.  All in all very good place to eat"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"My First time here with family. 
Sis and bro in law have been here. The blackened chicken sandwich and the Philly cheese steak were very good. 
I had the bone in wings, all flats and with the WILD sauce. Great flavor, crispness and meatiness. The sauce was flavorful and very hot. I'm a hot connoisseur, these gave me a great endorphin rush as well as a the other effects of the heat. 
Definitely stop by if you can"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here for brunch - loved the shakshuka and cheese curds! I got one of the pouch drinks which I wasn't crazy about but it's fun and worth getting it. The mimosa was good too. I came in the winter in one of their outdoor booths, I really wish it was a little more spacious and kept more warm (it was freezing.) I'd be back in warmer weather or if I were able to get an indoor reservation!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Here is another popular Philadelphia restaurant that I just don't get.  I have been here a few times (a few times of my own accord other times I just did not have a choice in the matter).

To me the food is just plain - boring - deep fried crap.  

The food is just so bland and flavorless I just could not even begin to think of eating here again.  

At least the bathrooms are clean."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Always great service, beautiful atmosphere, and an amazing menu! We've eaten here before, and each time we've had the same dish. The eggplant parm was tasty, the creole rice with the mushrooms and the eggplant was perfect. The best part was the excellent service. The servers were extremely attentive and very friendly! I will definitely be back!I love this place! I"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,What a treat. Very nice atmosphere. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our food and then the manager came to take our order. She came back and said we were out of the food. I said why? She brought out the food. She said we were out of the food and we had to wait another hour.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This was my first dining experience at The Ribeyes. I will admit that I have been wanting to try this place for a while, but since I have not been to The Ribeyes yet, I had no idea what to expect. The food was ok, but nothing spectacular. The servers were a bit slow, but the food was good. The atmosphere was nice and clean."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Best burger in Indy. Hands down. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the fries were so small. The burgers were delicious and the fries were tasty. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I was extremely disappointed. This was our first time coming here and we felt like we were being rushed. We waited about 10-15 minutes for our food.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is our go-to Thai spot. The food is amazing and the service is always excellent. We always get the pad Thai and the pad thai with the curry chicken. The curry chicken is amazing and so is the curry. I would highly recommend this place and will be back soon!This is a great place for a date night. The food is amazing and the service is great.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I'm going to start by saying that the food here is pretty good. I have had the stuffed mushrooms (which I had to get a second time) and the chicken salad. Both were delicious. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the chicken salad was tender and creamy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty, healthy option to eat on the beach."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I was introduced by an old friend and she was very knowledgeable about the menu and the local cuisine. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh and flavorful. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and it was great! I will definitely be back and I will definitely try the enchiladas next
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"I hadn't been to a Tampa location, so we decided to try it for ourselves. We ordered the gnocchi, the Chicken parm and the chicken sandwiches. Everything was very good. We also had the bread pudding. Both were very good. My husband had the chicken parm and said it was the best he's had in a while. My daughter had the crab cake."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Interesting place in a bad location. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The prices are a bit high for what you get. I would come back for the food and drink. Great food, great service. The food is always good and the service is always excellent."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I was there with my family on a weekend night. I saw a lot of people eating and we sat down.  The place was packed and the place was clean. The food was good. The cocktails were good. The service was good. I would come back to try their other items.We ordered the chicken nuggets and they were very good. They are a little pricey but it is
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had.  

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The burger is thick, not tough. It's good, but nothing special. 

The staff is friendly and always a pleasure to talk to.  I'm not sure if it's because they're all so"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. I always love the cheese steak and the fries. The service is always great, and the food is always tasty. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for lunch. If you are hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer for your food. I would recommend coming here on a weeknight if you are"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This review was originally written 11/2012...
Loved this place!  They nailed the decor and ambiance. Dark, chic, well lit and a really cool fish tank. Love that the staff dresses in period costume.
We went on a Wednesday night and the place was quiet, we had great service.  Very attentive.

Cocktails were delicious - you can really tell they spend time on making their drinks (they also tell you this!) and I imagine that the mixers are all made inhouse."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Wow!  Been looking for great Indian food in NOLA and have now found it!  The chicken vindaloo was perfect , spicy but not so hot that you missed any of the complexity of all the flavors!  And the bitter chicken was also fantastic! The naan bread as a side was exceptional (would be nice if you could order it as an app or larger side). The wine and drinks were an excellent compliment to our meals"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Service was good but the food was why I came. It's hard to find a good pizza joint around here. To me Pauls Chicago Pizza and Cristinos in Clearwater set the standard, this place can't compete. Ordered a Greek salad, a goat cheese burger and a cheese pizza to see what they were all about. Nothing to brag home about. The salad was dry, the burger was boring and the pizza was far from being New York style."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Lovely little brunch spot right in the heart of the downtown St Pete vibe. Took a girlfriend here for birthday brunch , it was a nice quite  place with lots of locals and charm. We both chatted and sipped on mimosas while we waited for our crepes. So many great options to choose from ! She had sweet and I had savory, and both were spectacular down to the last bite. Yummy I can taste it now ."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We had such a great dinner tonight. We were seated right away. The menu was full of options for seafood lovers and land lovers as well. My daughter ordered the fish special pretzel that was delicious. We ordered chicken tenders, shrimp tacos, a Greek salad and a chicken sandwich. Everything was really delicious. The food came out right away and was hot. We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu. *Kids menu and kid friendly."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This was our first time dining at this location. At this point I think Drago's is overrated.. It seems as though the food is prepared is a hurry like manner... Which can cause situation like, finding strange things in your food..I really just did not enjoy my meal this visit..Hubby had lobster, which he thoroughly enjoyed. I would suggest trying Drago's and make your own opinion .. I'm giving three stars based on our service., I waitress was GREAT!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Perfect. All of it. The steaks are perfect and they add a few things most other steak houses don't, French onion soup and a personally crafted baked potato made in front if you. All at a reasonable price, about 30% cheaper than what I paid for the steak alone at steakhouses in Chicago and NY. 
Take the free wine cellar your, its historical and check out the dessert room. Both add a unique flair to a top notch restaurant."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went because of diners,drive ins and dives. Went for Sunday brunch but was disappointed because the menu is different that day. Had very little to chose from. I had the tamale and it was ok, the staff was helpful and friendly.  The place is very small almost claustrophobic around the bar area and it feels old and dirty.    I don't think I will go back. Not because of any particular reason. Just not my thing."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,My fiancé and I go to Santa Barbara every other year for my birthday and each time we would come here for dinner. I usually will get the  Crawfish Pasta Lafitte. It's delicious! nice and flavorful and very filling. You have to get soufflé for dessert...we've tried both and both are rich and decadent... it's like a dream. I love both the whiskey or bourbon sauces that are poured on top.  Staff is very attentive and welcoming.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,First time experience.  Looking for a casual but nice place for dinner with wife.  Cassidy did an incredible job with service.  Very attentive and patient going over the menu.  Food quality and presentation was spot on.  We will definitely be back...We think we found our new go to place!  Andy did a great job engaging with the tables  (not just ours) and was a great leader!  Well done Oak and Ola!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Its one of my fav restaurants in st.Louis. The Vietnamese Iced coffee is really amazing and my fav food here is crisp calamari, prawn curry with eggplant which tastes amazing with rice. They have amazing crepes as well. The staff is good here, but there is one vietnamese guy in particular, i dont know his name, everytime i go there i forget to check his name. He always has a smile on his face and is always very considerate."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"I went to go pick up a sandwich for my in-laws... She said she wanted a Dagwood with all meats and Swiss. I go to Penn Station to order and the cashier tells me ""if you can't tell me the names of the meats, you'll just get bread."" ""She says all of them..."" To which I'm told ""If you can't figure out how to order a sandwich, maybe you should go to subway.""

Yeah, screw this place. Not going back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Oh my lord! Just had a craving for a shrimp fried steak. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce was spot on. I got the fried green tomatoes and it was so good. I will be back! I will be back soon!This is a great place for a date night. The food is amazing and the service is great.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,The sausage and pepper sub was a huge let down. I will say that the sausage was pretty good. The pepper had a nice kick to it but the flavor was not great. The sausage was a little tough and not very flavorful. The pepper was ok but not great. The sauce was not a lot of spice to it. I would give it 3 stars but I wish I could give it a
Restaurants,4.0,CG,the food was amazing. Staff was friendly and the food was good. We also had the charbroiled oysters. The oysters were good but the charbroiled was very salty. The oysters were good but I would have liked them a little more salty. The sauce was great. The oysters were seasoned very well and the charbroiled was so juicy.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Just take the avocado bubble tea. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the cup was a little too thick for my liking. I think the place is pretty cool. It's kinda quiet in there so it's kind of a cool vibe to sit and have a drink. The place is pretty busy so it's pretty loud and it gets a little crowded.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I haven't eaten at a lot of restaurants in the city but this place did not disappoint!  The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious.  The only thing that was disappointing was that the bread was extremely thick.  This is a great place for a special occasion.  I highly recommend it!I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Went with my wife and daughter. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out.

Our server was extremely rude and"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Arrived here and was seated immediately. The hostess was very friendly and attentive. She recommended the tapas so we had a seat. We ordered the chicken and waffles.

Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Friends and I came in here for the first time. I had a lovely waitress, and she was very attentive. 

We ordered the fried chicken sandwiches, which was very good. I had a couple of fries, which were very good. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and it was great! I will definitely be back.I ordered a pizza for delivery and it was awesome."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Just stopped in here for a quick bite after a day of work. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was that the staff was extremely rude. I was very impressed.Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this was by far the best."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,A classic. My dad grew up on the east coast and I grew up on the west coast. The atmosphere is great. The food is delicious. The drinks are tasty. The atmosphere is nice. The staff is very friendly. I would come back for the food.It was good. I had a chicken dish with a side of greens. The chicken was good but the greens were overcooked and
Restaurants,1.0,CG,"Ghetto is the best way to describe the food and atmosphere of this place. The servers are awesome and the food is always delicious. The food is freshly made and the portions are very large. If you are in the area, try it out. If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this is the place to go!This place is great! Great food and service! I will definitely"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Good place but I have had better at the airport. I will not be going back. The best fried chicken in the area. The fries are crispy, and the chicken is cooked to perfection. The fried pickles are good, but they aren't as good as some places in the area. The fried pickles are the best I have had in the area."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Hostess was wonderfull.  Waiter took over 40 minutes for first appearance,  These days we were warned so understood. The restaurant appeared as understaffed. Then the bill came... $2.00 or $3.00 for bourbon Rock (ice cube) for my bourbon? ?  $3.00 for bread to go with with appetizer (maybe)???   $9.00 for side of pasta to go with Veal Marsala def not.     Will not be back and management did not seem to care."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went there last month for weekend brunch. We didn't have to wait long since we were a party of 2. It was busy, but the service was good. Looking at the food around us, I couldn't decide - everything looked so good. We had the huevos rancheros and the veggie Benedict with rosemary fries. Both were delicious. I even had leftovers that I enjoyed later. 
Cash only, but there is an ATM just outside. Will definitely come back again!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The Roxborough Seafood House has the BEST wait staff ever. They were so attentive to me and my family. The drink seemed weak at first, but I was definitely tipsy when leaving and I only had one. The food was ok, to say the least. I think that night I wasn't really in the mood for seafood or fried food for that matter. Maybe I could experience this restaurant again, when I get the chance and update on my experience."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm visiting Tampa, and I found this restaurant here on Yelp. I took a chance, and I was not disappointed! It is such a cute little restaurant with so much character. The servers were so polite. In fact my server, Luriana, even walked me to my car with an umbrella because it was storming outside! The food is exactly how everyone describes: amazing! I had the pollo margherita. It was delicious! I highly recommend and can't wait to go back!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Craving some late night pizza but not craving the super saucy and greasy pizzas from a chain? Giorgio's is your place. I satisfied my cheesy post bar-hopping needs with their AMAZING eggplant pizza per the recommendation of a friend an, man, I eat this pizza all the time now regardless of my libations. 

Parking is a little difficult if you are picking up alone since it is on a main street but not to worry - the service is quick!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Love this part of town and really like the energy in this lovely bar/ tavern.  Drinks were a bit hard to come by as they had one poor soul on staff serving the entire bar as well as preparing drinks for the dining area.  Loved the decor particularly the giant chandelier.  Did not try the food but items coming out of the kitchen all looked good. It is necessary to make a reservation for the outdoor deck.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My wife and I went to Bayona last night.  Ashley was wonderful as wait staff.  The sweetbreads were great.  My wife had the lamb which was wonderful as well.  Cream of garlic soup was good and the caramelized garlic on top was fantastic.  I only gave four strs because the pork chop with eggplant was very over salted.  I found it interesting that the greens with them were perfect, obviously another sous chef responsible."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Awful experience as a result of poorly trained staff and the inability of the business to handle the various pick up apps and seated guests.  It took over 2 hours to be served 6 sushi rolls.  Once served, the quality was mediocre at best.  Had to ask for the basics like chop sticks, soy sauce bowls and napkins.  Might be smart to reduce the gigantic menu offered.  I would avoid this place like the plague."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Never disappointed. Food and service always great. The hostess was super busy and doing a great job multi tasking. A lot of the servers have been there for years which says a lot about the company. The steaks are better than some of the high end steakhouses in Tampa. We always order the wild west shrimp. Last night I had the renegade with the steakhouse Mac n cheese. My husband had the filet mignon and lobster tail.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Stopped in here with my mom after her doctors appointment. We were immediately greeted by a very nice lady working the counter. She took our order and we waited a short time and she brought out pizza to the table. We ordered 2 cheese pizza lunch specials. The pizza was huge! It was very hot and tasted great. We live in Plant City but I would drive back over there any day for that pizza. Thanks for a great meal.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Moxies ""We're fancier than BP's""

Basically cut from the same cloth as Earl's and Joey's...   Service is good and professional, food is delicious, wine list is good.   

I had the penne toscana (penne, bacon, mushrooms, white wine reduction sauce) with the house red (which I believe was a malbec).  I would for sure have it again and do recommend it.

Moxies is great for lunches, dinners, first dates, patio happy hours (try the bulldog) birthdays or anniversaries."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Service was great. The food cake out very fast (you might want to order one or two dishes at a time if you want a relaxed dining experience) and the staff were great. 

My favorite dish was the glazed pork belly. The crispy jumbo shrimp were a close second. The sea bass was also very nice. 

Their take on a sangria was lovely. It was nice and light and not too strong. Be sure to check out the saki menu."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Beautiful roof top. We were here on a weekend night and we were seated right away. We ordered the gnocchi and the Chicken parmigiana. The gnocchi were amazing. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I would highly recommend this restaurant.I've been coming here for years.  I have to say it's by far the best Chinese food I've had in a while
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Scallops were done Perfecto. My wife had the Ribeye which was also very good. She said the ribeye was too fatty and overcooked. The salad was okay. The creamed spinach was good. It was a little pricey for what it is. But the service was great and the food was excellent. I would definitely go back.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I've had pretty okay food here. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The prices are a bit high for what you get. I would come back for the food and the atmosphere.I'm always a fan of this place!  I'm not sure if it's a new owner or just a new
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Solid place for breakfast. My go to breakfast spot.Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is very friendly and helpful.  He is the best customer service I have ever experienced.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken burrito with no onions. He liked it and I liked mine. The service was good and the food came out quickly.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Don't let the strip mall location fool you. This is a great place for a quick bite and a drink. Great drinks and food, great service and the atmosphere is fun. I would definitely go again. The best in the area. The food is great and the staff are very friendly. We have been here a few times and each time the service is great. The food is great."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Nancy, our server was amazing. We had the crab cakes and the shrimp and grits. Both were fantastic. The shrimp and grits were delicious and crispy on the outside. The crab cakes were cooked perfectly and the shrimp were good size. The crab cakes were very rich and flavorful. The grits were a little tough to eat and I would not recommend the grits."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Ordered takeout from here and it was the best food i've had in my entire life!  The owner and the staff are very friendly and accommodating.  I'll be back soon!The food was okay, the service was a little slow. I ordered the seafood gumbo which was also pretty good. I also ordered the fried catfish which was good, but the crab cake was a little"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,This is the laziest store I have ever been to. I will never go back. Very disappointed. Went here for the first time last week and ordered the Tuna melt. It was ok. The flavor was not great. I would have liked it a little more spicy. The sauce was not a lot of flavor. I did get a side of the rice with the meal.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Visited last weekend with my wife. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place. The food is good, but the service is not."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"One if the best restaurants in the area. Great ambiance, nice staff, excellent food and great atmosphere. Great place to get a bite to eat!I love this place. The food is always great and the service is always great. I wish I could give it 5 stars. I love the food and service. I go here every single time I'm in the area. I will say I have"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,So I absolutely fell in love with the food and ambiance. The food was absolutely delicious. The burrito was a solid 4 out of 5 stars. The guacamole was a little bland. The guac was absolutely delicious. I also had the chicken enchiladas. They were also very tasty. The enchiladas were a little bland.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I think ppl should take a hint from all the mixed reviews on here --- Porcini is inconsistent at best.  I think it's cute all these ""New Yorkers"" like the place.  Reality is for the price, the quality and portions should be higher.  A woman I was with once giggled nervously when they brought out a $26 veal special that was seriously four bites.  People need to get out more if they think this place is fantastic."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I've been coming here for 10 years and love it each time I come. Their house margaritas are really good and really strong! The salsas that they give you when you sit down are amazing, a really good roasted tomato salsa and a corn/bean one. My favorite dish is the chicken with Anaheim chiles. The outside patio is really nice, the heat lamps keep it really comfortable all year round. A band plays on the weekend. Great food and great atmosphere."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Extremely disappointed with this location was there this morning with my husband I was looking forward to their green chili bagels all morning and got there and all they had was this cheese covered horrible looking version! I asked for a iced hazelnut coffee that was on there menu all I received was hot hazelnut coffee over ice that melted by the time cashier gave it to me! I will never ever return to this location all others are Way better!!!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Food was trash for how expensive it was. nothing was made fresh all packaged foods. Sorry I'm not paying $150 for poor cuts of meat and pre packaged potatoes. The wine wasnt even good quality and on top of that the waiter decided to give himself a $55 tip on my card when I only left him $35, which I now disputed w my credit card company. I would not recommend to anyone. Very outdated, poor quality food, and over priced"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Food here is great. Atmosphere is ok but looks dated. I wish the place had better air conditioning and a more modern look and feel to it. Small touches here and there truly would bring this place to the top. Food is amazing and very authentic from the salad bar all the way to the meat selections. I consider the food to be similar to fogo de chao but at half the price. Overall it's a great place in northeast Philadelphia.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Good beer, ok food.

It does have unique ambiance which was the saving grace of this place. Of course, this review is also based on coming as a large group so I won't gig them on the slow service.

I did have the landjager and was full by the end. however, I wasn't impressed and enjoyed the beer more than anything else. If I do go back, I will eat first and come for the drinking. Beyond that, it's not worth the coin."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Now here's a hint that knows how to make a good burger. Fries are bountiful and tasty, burgers are filled well and full of great flavor. It's all fresh, quick, and good. Sure you pay a bit more than your typical fast food nonsense but at least you get something to show for it unlike shake shack. Now they have milkshakes too which I need to try. Haven't had one of them since rubies vanished from the kop mall."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Very disappointed. My husband and I stop here frequently (2-3x per month) for a beer after shopping at Kroger. Tonight We were told rudely we would have to wait 15-20 minutes for a seat at the bar (even though there were only 2 people at the bar) because the servers were busy. The red headed waitress needs to ask for advice rather than make stupid decisions that result in Dales regulars leaving to go to Wings Etc for their cold one
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Epic.  We northerners were on a road trip and decided we needed to have some hot chicken.  Of course we only ordered mild.  Did I say we were northerners?

This is Seriously amazing, juicy, delicious chicken.  I ordered almost every side available and by far my favorite was the red potato salad with the fries, greens, and Mac and cheese coming in next-- in that order.  

Save room for the cobbler.  Awesome experience while visiting Nashville."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I love this place and the owners, Jay and Lara, who is also the culinary director.  Lara's passion for food is infectious.  The hands on classes are the perfect bonding experience, for couples, employees, parents and kids and friends.  The best part is you always have an amazing meal and come away with new friends, great recipes and improved kitchen skills too.  When you are feeling lazy or are short on time, the deli is delicious too."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,I'll start off with the negative- the place looks fairly creepy from the outside. The main door is blocked and directs you to a small side door which had me a little sketched out as someone not from the area. Once we got inside the space was awesome and the patio was even more notable. An absolutely great outdoor space. My Moscow mule was noticeably missing the trademark copper cup but was solid otherwise  and the whole experience was great.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"WTF!!! Cook was not wearing a mask and the food was cold. 
We got the crawfish and shrimp.  The crawfish was good but the shrimp was so salty it was like it was made in the kitchen.   The shrimp was ok but the crawfish was not the best.  
The service was also terrible.  The waiter was very rude and seemed like he was"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,The sushi rolls are amazing! We have never had a bad meal here. Highly recommend!Very good. We had the burrito and the eggplant parmigiana. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the eggplant was so fresh. The eggplant was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste. I would definitely go back again.I've been here several times and have
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Arario is my husband's new go to pizza place. We've tried a lot of the local and we've always had a great experience. We also get the Tuna melt, it's so good! We love the flavors of the tuna and it's always fresh. I recommend coming here with friends.We had a reservation and it was ready in about 5 minutes. We had a great waitress and she"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"Came here with a friend and it was an awesome experience. The food was great, the service was fast and friendly. The place is small and small, but the food was very good. I had the chicken and waffles, which was absolutely delicious. I also had the short ribs with mac and cheese and they were the best I've had in a while. I will definitely be coming back here again"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,We waited over half an hour for our food and it was cold. When we got home the food was so cold we couldn't eat it. The salad was okay. The creamed spinach was good. The bread was good.  The mashed potatoes were OK. I ordered the turkey with turkey. It was very good and the flavor was good. The gravy was ok. I also ordered a cheese steak.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Found out about Primo while visiting New Orleans. We decided to try it for the first time and we were so impressed. The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. The only thing that we didn't like was that the bread was stale. I would definitely come back. Great food, great service. The food is always good and the service is always excellent."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Ordered for the first time last night and the food was good. The cheese steak was awesome. The mac and cheese was alright. The salad was okay. The mac and cheese was okay. The salad was fresh and it was warm and tasty. The staff was great. I will definitely be back. I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,First time here for my birthday. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The mac and cheese was awesome and the bacon was so fresh. The best part was our server. She was attentive and gave us great service. I will definitely be back!Delicious food and service! I will definitely be back.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We went out to our usual place and the food was good but not spectacular. I ordered the duck confit and the fries. The duck was cooked well and the fries were okay. The duck was a little bland. The flavor was good. I would come back for the duck confit and fries.The service was great and the food was great! The owner was so sweet and made sure we were taken
Restaurants,1.5,CG,"I always go to location here. The food is good but it's always slow. I'm not a big fan of the food, but the staff is always friendly. The only reason I go here is because of the location. I came here for lunch with my family. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. They also had a great wine list."
Restaurants,2.0,CG,I don't eat McDonald's but this place is the best. I will be going back!Very good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were good. I had a burger and fries. I did not like the chicken and it was a little tough.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,My favorite Thai place. Yellow curry is the best and you can't go wrong with the pad thai. If you want to get your Thai fix then the Tandoori curry is the best.Delicious breakfast in a beautiful location. The best part about this place is the staff. They are very friendly and quick to take your order. The food is always delicious and I love the biscuits and gravy
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Great place next to the Hudson Marina. A lot of space, so very little wait time. They have two bars and live band with a nice assortment tunes. Seafood was delicious. Servers was awesome. I wish there were more like him
Drinks are affordable and the dishes were modest to slightly up there in price. I've been to places that served a lot less for a lot more $$$.
They have seafood sandwiches, baskets as well as full dinners. I will definitely going back!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,whimsical!  love sitting in the garden behind the café.  i usually get a delicious grilled cheese and tomato sandwich and sweet potato fries.  free wi-fi is always a plus in my book.  love the healthy choices on the menu & the doggy menu is such a great idea!  really friendly service.  enjoy looking at all the stuff for sale after i finish eating there.  we go back to sweet sage every time we're in town!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Originally when my friends picked this place for a group outing I wasn't thrilled by the menu but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. It is definitely a dive restaurant and is small so not ideal for large parties (although they put us in the basement which worked out). The drink selection is great! Food is rich but good. I got the fettuccine and probably wouldn't get it again. However, there seems to be a lot of good options on the menu!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We had a Groupon and so we tried this place. It was amazing! I loved all the fact I could design my own pizza.  Everything was fresh and good quality. We ordered 2 pizza's and also a large Ceaser Salad.  The Romain wasn't as fresh as I felt it should be for the Ceaser. That's the reason for 4 stars, but the pizza's are for sure 5 stars!  We will be going back. Try them, you won't be disappointed."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,For some reason this restaurant always seems to have a ridiculously long wait time. While the food is good it is nothing that can't be found at many other St. Louis Mexican restaurants. Perhaps it is just a Kirkwood icon which explains the locals eating there in large numbers. But I personally will not bother to wait an hour to eat an average taco. I would rather spend the time driving to Cherokee Street and getting something closer to real Mexican food.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"After seeing only 10 people in the café at a bit before 1pm, I thought it would've been faster. I waited over 30 minutes for a crepe only to have it delivered to another customer. I asked about it and they said they can make another. I couldn't wait another 30 minutes. While at the counter, another customer asked about her crepe as well. The lady behind the counter got a little upset and proceeded to list the problems with their kitchen."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Ordered vegetarian pizza to be delivered. It was awful. The bottom dough was thick like a flatbread instead of pizza dough. We were hoping for a crunchy thin crust instead received mostly dough with a small amount of sauce and veggies. Very disappointing when you are hungry and craving a delicious pizza and are so disappointed because it was a waste of money and we had to find something else in our house to eat. Won't be ordering anything from here again.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"We ordered pizza for delivery. They sold  our pizza to another customer and had to make another one for us. It took an hour and half to get our order.
When we received the pizza it was a crust with a tomato sauce on it. No seasoning, no garnish. Looked like something kids baked.
This was the worst pizza we ever had.
We called the them to complain and the manager was very unprofessional and rude.
This was the worst pizza experience for my family."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is hands down one of the best sushi spots I've been too and I've been to my fair share of sushi restaurants. I used to live in New York and the sushi here is actually better! The ingredients are fresh, the seaweed salad is made with real seaweed as well as the miso soup. The owner and staff are genuinely kind and super friendly. We love coming here! I highly recommend, we've been here a dozen times and it never disappoints."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Ew ew ew. We ordered the chicken fried rice, chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce, General Tso's chicken, and egg roll. All of them were awful. The fried rice was super bland, chicken and broccoli came in brown sauce and the chicken was super mushy, the General Tso's chicken was soft without a lot of sauce, and the egg roll was greasy. I wish I could give a better review but we literally couldn't finish our meal. We will not be returning."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Nastiest food in the fuckin world. Used to be good now it's just disgusting. Pepperoni cheesesteak. Steak is overly charred to the point there's a bunch of soot-like shit all over the bread. Most tasteless Italian hoagie I've ever eaten. 

Just ordered on a Friday night. That shit ruined my night. Now I got a bunch of nasty ass food to slowly and agonizingly eat over the weekend. I was having a good day and this really did ruin my night. Smh."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"AWESOME!!!! Best brisket I've had in a long time! The building is old but totally restored and clean inside. Modern, but definitely the down home feeling you look for with BBQ. One of the owners served me, super nice guy. We probably talked about bbq and building smokers for 15 minutes. I'm from out of state but definitely plan to hit this place again before leaving town. All the great sides that come with bbq. To sum it up, DAMN GOOD FOOD!!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've only been once, but I will be back. I will say that the service was awesome. The food was amazing. I got the chicken curry, which was very good. The curry was so flavorful and I loved it. My boyfriend got the Thai chicken curry with shrimp. He liked it, but I think the chicken curry was a little too spicy."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Good music 
Great large combo of flavors
Awesome food
Definitely will be back!Very good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were good. I had a burger and fries. I did not like the chicken and it was a little tough."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Talk about delicious! This NOLA gem has the best food in town. 

The food is always delicious and the service is always great. 

I think this place is going to be a regular stop for us. I will be back!This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we were very disappointed. We ordered the crab cake appetizer and my"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is definitely a ""MUST go to"" place to try out if you're in the area.Great atmosphere and great food! I got the ribeye, and it was great. The rice was very good and the sauce was very fresh. The best part was the service. The waitress was very nice and attentive. I will definitely be back.I ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived 15 minutes after"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Best Taqueria I've been to in a long time.  I will say that the food was pretty good.  The burrito was a bit small but the flavor was good.  The rice was good and the beans were good.  The tamales were very good.  The churros were very good.  I did not try the chicken quesadilla but I will say it was
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Friendly locals sports bar. Stick with the beer and wine. I will return for sure!Very good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were good. I had a burger and fries. I did not like the chicken and it was a little tough.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Burnt Okra, bring it back, it's the best. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to get your food to go, you can't go wrong with this place. I'll be back. I will most likely be going with the combo meal. The wings are a bit too spicy, but it's a good thing the fries are crispy. I also love that they"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"China King is a good spot to visit with a group of friends. There is a large menu and a lot of food to choose from. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. They have a great selection of beers on tap. If you're looking for a good beer with great food, this is your spot!This place is great! Great food and service! I will definitely be back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"When this place first opened, it was a chain. I'm not sure if the owners were new or what but the food was mediocre at best. The sandwiches were pretty average. The chicken sandwich was okay. It was bland and not very flavorful. My boyfriend got the chicken salad sandwich with no dressing. He liked it but it was a bit over cooked. I think the bread was a little dry but overall it"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Attended a family gathering for a friend and the food was good. 

The service was good. 

If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, this is the place to go. It's a little pricey for what you get but worth it.Great food, great service. 
The atmosphere is very relaxing and the food was very tasty. 
We will be back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Sam's Place used to be a staple in the area. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but that is the only reason I give 4 stars. The food was great. The server was nice and attentive. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I got the fried oysters and the shrimp was a little salty."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Been coming here for 15 years. The food is good but it's always a little slow. The atmosphere is great. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great.I'm so excited to come here!  I've been coming here for years and it's always been one of my favorite places to go to when I'm in the area.  I've heard great things about the place,"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great brunch.  I got the Hawaiian Benedict which was unique, and I feel like that's a hard challenge for breakfast food anymore!  The waitress suggested I get the spicier sausage which was an excellent move for the dish as well.  My friend got the tater tot scrambler, and I'm pretty sure there wasn't a crumb left on either of our plates.  The manager checked in with our table, and our server was delightful.  I will definitely be back!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"You just walk in and seat yourself. Order from your waiter  and enjoy the awesome food and daiquiris!!! My brother and I both ordered the sampler in which you get: a cup of gumbo, a cup of jambalaya and a cup of red beans and rice. The food was great! We also ordered the ice cream daiquiris and they were so amazing!! It's an outdoor place and you have to deal with the elements, but other than that I highly recommend it!"
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"0 for 4 on our recent orders, in terms of preparing the order as requested.  This last time it was tacos missing cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  Preparation is also very inconsistent compared to other Chipotles.  This last order also had soggy chips...yup soggy.  There's nothing complex about the orders they are getting wrong either.  I can't understand how the quality could be so very poor.  I love Chipotle, but I cannot recommend this location at all."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Came here for my birthday dinner and can't recommend it enough for sushi in the St. Louis area. I had the miso soup, house salad, drunken fish roll and California roll and they were all fantastic. As a drink the table got a raspberry lemonade fish bowl and strawberry sake shots. Really tasty.

The service was also excellent. Jason and Jamie are two servers I would highly recommend. They will make sure to check on you throughout your meal and take care of you."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Meh. Nothing to write home about. After reading the reviews, My expectations were set really high. Prices are good, food not so much.

They forgot my drink. Tacos were okay, meat was good. Rice was dry, beans were moosh. I hoped the empanada would save it for me, but it was the worst part. Looked like it was fried for the second time, dripping in oil, inside was a soggy mess. No flavor, at all. 

I'll chalk it up that I ordered it late."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I am a fan of seafood! I have been here a few times, and I would have to say that I have not had any issues. We even went as a large party two years ago for a friend's birthday and they were able to customized the seating arrangements so we could all be together or in close proximity. The staff was extremely friendly as well. Plus, I love anytime that I can eat seafood while also enjoying a view of the water."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We came in for Sunday brunch. This interior is really nice. The staff was great, starting with the hostesses, and servers. The food was so delicious!!!  We ordered the lumpia spring rolls. They came with two dipping sauces and were great. For breakfast I had the soft shell crab Benedict with Sunda potatoes and my husband had the chicken and waffles. For drinks my husband had a yozu mimosa and I had the Bloody Mary bar. 
We will definitely be coming back!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"We spent 36 dollars on three plate lunches. After going to our seats, and taking a few bites, I approached the counter again. I just wanted some teriyaki sauce on my teriyaki chicken since it was given to me dry. They either wanted to charge a fee to give it to me or take the box which had already been eaten from to add more sauce. I went back to my table and returned the box. Hello health code violation, hello rude cook."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The original Mac n Cheese is all but original.  If you enjoy ""from the box"" mac, this ""outside the box"" recipe will certainly not disappoint!  I highly recommend adding the pulled BBQ chicken.  It adds a lot of flavor and is very tender.  Possibly the most overlooked and underrated item on the menu are the cookies and cream truffles.  These are a must try.  Trust me, this place is worth every penny!  Don't disrespect the MAC!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Cool restaurant and atmosphere, even for a lunchtime visit. LARGE place. Definitely not the most authentic place in town for sure. Ordered the chicken nachos and was not impressed. Too many peppers and tomatoes with bland, melted cheese (not that white queso you find at authentic places). There was literally like 8 chips buried somewhere beneath all of the cheese, tomatoes, chicken, and peppers. I would call myself a cheese lover, but this was an exception. Not worthy of $9 in my eyes."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Premier resto au centre de St-Louis et carton plain. Une ambiance méxicaine très bien présentée,un accueil très chaleureux. Le resto à 2 étages, et c'est la pour moi qu'ils vont perdre l'étoile manquante..... les sorties de climatisation sont orientée contre les tables, ce qui procure un courant d'air pérmanent, ce qui n'est pas très agréable et encore moi quand on est un peut frileux ( pas mon cas).
Les plats sont très bien servi.. il y a de la qualité et de la quantité."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Wow! What a place. I really enjoyed it here. The food was great, the staff was great. I don't know why everyone was talking to much smack about their customer service... Maybe y'all just need to get there when they open, because I really enjoyed how happy and helpful they were. 
I enjoyed the Diego bowl. While it is expensive, you're getting a LOT of ""food."" The flavors were mild, but very filling. 
Worth a stop if you want something light yet filling."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I ordered a carnitas taco and it was just ok. I will say that the tortilla chips were a little too thick and the meat was tough and the flavor was not great. The rice was good and the beans were good. 

I would come back to try the other items on the menu.The food is good, but the service is not. I've had great service at other restaurants, but"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We stopped in today for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the fries. The sandwich had a nice, thick cut of beef and a nice, crisp, crunchy, lettuce wrap. The fries were fresh and crispy. I liked the fries. The sandwich was huge. The bun was crispy and tasty. The fries were good and I loved how they came with a side of lettuce."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"This Taco Bell is a little more than half the size of its original location, but the restaurant is still so close to the beach, and the staff is always friendly. The food is consistently good, and the service is good too. If you are looking for a good meal in Santa Barbara, this is the place to go!This place is great! Great food and service! I will definitely be back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Ate here when passing through Tampa. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We were looking forward to eating here and will not be coming back. I think they need to get a lot more staff to
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"Me and my husband love this place and the food is good. 
We got the crawfish and shrimp and the fries. The crawfish and shrimp were tasty. The fries were ok. The crawfish and shrimp were a little overcooked. My husband got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I got the pork chop and it was good but nothing special. I liked the gravy on the pork"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Karee (curry) puffs are a must. The curry is a good mix of flavors, the fruit is good, and the puffs are a solid size. The flavor of the puffs is definitely worth it. 

The staff is friendly and welcoming. This is a great place for a special occasion. I have to say it's a bit pricey for a lunch buffet, but the food"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"i always ge the same, but the food is just ok. 

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, and the bun is very soft. 

The only thing I would change is the customer service. If you are coming for the food, it's a good bet that they are getting you right. Otherwise, you're going to get a great meal with good"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Oh, My!
The Indianapolis Star had this place as an alternative to the chain restaurants that have been around for a while. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken fried steak was great and the tenderloin was very tender and cooked to perfection. The Tenderloin was a bit dry and flavorless. The chicken fried steak was so juicy and delicious! My"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"After standing at the hostess stand, the hostess was rude and unapologetic. When she finally came over, I asked her to get the manager, and she did not even offer to take our order. I will never be coming back to this location. Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this was by far the best."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Went on a Wednesday evening and it was busy. We were seated immediately and the server was very attentive. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers and shared the fried green tomatoes. The fried green tomatoes were amazing. I would order it again. I also had the short rib with shrimp. It was very good and the shrimp was very fresh and flavorful. I wish I could have ordered a different side of"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Went today and it was a busy night. We ordered two pizzas for 2 people and one to go. The pizza was cold, the cheese sauce was not melted. The pizza was ok. The only thing that was good was the coffee. I would come back to try their other items. We ordered the chicken nuggets and they were very good. The only thing that was bad was the cheese sauce."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've been going here with my wife and daughter for years. We always have a great time. The food is delicious. We also get the vegetarian chili. It's so good. It's not spicy, it's not spicy. It's flavorful. I always get the same thing every time. The food is good and I always get the same thing every time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Not bad - I like the chicken - crispy and had some heat.

The greens were the best thing, though. I went the back the week after  and ordered a large greens to go and had it as a side with my home cooked dinner (I didn't feel like cooking greens myself).

There is a lot of competition in the chicken game in STL, and a couple places are better - it's all about how you like your chicken though... Service was fast and friendly."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Let me preface this by I don't have any problems with the service or the environment. Being truthful, we came here after presto pasta was packed, and were still looking for an Italian experience. The problem is that the food was definitely below par. I got the spaghetti and meatballs, both the spaghetti and meatballs didn't taste close to fresh, and the meatballs tasted fairly bland as well. The raviolis my partner got tasted very undercooked as well. Food wasn't worth the price man"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Believe the hype!  We went for Brunch and loved it.  Local crowd, live music, outdoor seating, laid back atmosphere, attentive waitstaff, local dishes  elevated to the next level flavor without being overdone.  We had Louisanne(Crab Cake) Benedict perfectly poached eggs, delicate hollandaise, Rockefeller spinach was unique and delicious addition.  Shrimp and Grits was a show stopper with large head on shrimp, flavorful smokey broth and creamy grits.   Will definitely recommend to friends and family traveling to NOLA."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"We love this place, and always have fun with the kids here, but they need to really work on their customer service. Their chicken lettuce wraps are yummy, and my wife loved her Asian salad. The wings were dry so we asked for more sauce. It came after we almost finished our plate. 
The server didn't even acknowledge us when she gave us the bill. I know some people have bad days, and it was Memorial Day, but be more professional to your customers."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Chef Mark and crew hit it out of the park again.  Had a birthday dinner for a relative, the surf and turf special was great.  5oz filet and crab cake on a bed of risotto.  Outstanding.  My mom got the seafood di Mare, looked good, tasted even better.  Overall everyone was very happy with their meal.  They're not the cheapest restaurant around but the quality is there, you get what you pay for and it's definitely worth it."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"You want authentic Mexican food, Juan Carlos will get it to you. I haven't seen him in a while but I would specifically drive from south jersey to pick up an order. I've introduced atleast twenty people myself to him and all of them have loved it and many even have gone back. His spice level is amazing and he is extremely humble. I honestly would check it out and just talk to him and he will try making you something you will enjoy."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great beer selection, on tap, and in cans and bottles. The bartenders were cool, and came by just enough to keep me happy without hovering.  The food is overpriced for the portions, but great for portion control.  I got the Cuban, which was excellent, but 12 dollars for half a cuban roll, instead of a full one with half to take home. But, i had heard this going in, so they get 5 stars for service, beer offer, and quality of food."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I waited a couple of minutes at the hostess stand.  Other people arrived, the young lady finally came out from behind the pick up area.  She seated the party of 4 and left me at the stand without a word. I finally sat myself after she didn't come back.
I sat down at a table & 9 1/2 minutes later a server greeted me.  Good service once I was finally greeted.  I came for UFC fight or I would have left"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My absolute favorite place to get food in soulard!! Their menu is so unique and unlike many sandwich shops. I'm currently obsessed with the raging Cajun and side of Mac and cheese but there are so many favorites of mine! The jams and sauces they offer are out of this world. I highly recommend checking this place out!

The decor is very rustic and I love it. You can sit inside on long farmhouse style tables or outside by the fire. Always a great experience."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Maria's is a nice family restaurant with good fresh food. Maria is a great cook and very attentive to the food quality. She makes a delicious chicken soup that is not on the menu but you can order it. I took a tamale cooking class with Maria. The pork & cheese/chile tamales, salsa and sopa with ice cream were delicious. We did not get home made tortilla chips but maybe they are on the regular menu. It's worth trying if you're in the area."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Honestly can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and remembered my servers name. I've only been to sandbar twice but had multiple staff members help me each time. Chelsea, Heather, Abby, and Roxy absolutely made my experience and I look forward to coming back soon and being waited on by your fabulous staff. All of the girls were very knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding area, constantly checked up on my table and were genuinely friendly people."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Tacos y Mariscos Lindo is dat authentic mex hot fire! ordered up a $15 smoked whole chicken with all the sides and endless corn tortillas. Crushed it like a boss - feeds two. Chicken strait from the smoker out front. Hot sauce was fire and beer was cold. Joint is also next to a Mexican bakery tienda. A little seedy but so is Madison. (If ya basic and like over priced small tacos at bar taco on 12th south - don't come here.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I absolutely love this place. We have been here many times and it's always great! The service is always so friendly and the food is delicious. The salad bar is huge and I love that it's made fresh. The outside tables are clean and the staff is always so nice. The only downside is that it's a bit pricy but the food is always good and the prices are very reasonable.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I feel bad giving thid a 4 star rating because i was expecting more! The food was awesome. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little spicy but the flavor was good. The burrito was a little bland but it was just ok.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Came here last night while visiting my family. We decided to split a salad for the first time. It was delicious. The house salad was also very fresh and tasty. The salad was made with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The salad was very fresh. My husband had the chicken and waffles and it was great! I had the red velvet pancakes and the waffles were so good. They were very moist and fluffy.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Looking for a place to eat with family and friends in Nashville?  This is the place!  We had reservations for 6:30 on a Friday night and were seated at a large table with a table of 6 in the dining room.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  We had a glass of wine and the food came out pretty quick.  I had the pork chops and my husband had the chicken and w
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"See my review for the weekend. )

We decided to split a salad for the three of us. The salad was the most delicious and most fresh we've had. The rice was so fresh and the flavors were so fresh. I had the seafood pasta. The pasta was a bit too spicy for me and I'm not a seafood fan. It was also very good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,It was ok food (if not better than the chain) but it was also a little overpriced.I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked to order and the chorizo was very thick. I was hungry so I had to wait for a bit. I was disappointed because I thought the chicken was good. I've had better. I just didn't care for
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I feel lucky to have this place open as it is close to my house. I have been here twice and have had a great meal both times. The first time I was in the mood for a steak and eggs burrito and a coffee. I ordered the steak and eggs burrito with no side. I was disappointed to see that the side was made with potatoes instead of eggs. I didn't get the side I requested
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I was driving on the weekend and saw the long line of people waiting for a table. When I walked in the hostess told me that they have a ""good"" menu and that it was a good time. I was very pleased. I got the shrimp and grits and a fried egg with a side of cornbread. Both were very good. I will definitely be back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The quality of the meat and the quantity of the meat was all around excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is clean. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table in the parking lot. This is a great place for a quick lunch.The service was great and the food was great! The owner was so sweet and made sure we were taken care of.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is one of my favorite places in the area. I always get the cheese steak and the fries. The service is always great, and the food is consistently great. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer for your food. I usually get the chicken tenders and they are great. I always get the gyro and"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My friends and I ordered the crab claws with shrimp. It was pretty good, the shrimp were cooked perfectly and the crab claws were a bit tough but the flavor was good. I would definitely go back. 

We got a coffee and some water and it was very good. I had a glass of wine and the flavor was good. The crab claws were a little tough but I liked the flavor. 

"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The food is amazing!  Catch them at happy hour and you get 2.00 buckets of shrimp and some other popular appetizers. 

I got the lobster tails and it was fairly reasonable price wise. If you decide to park there be prepared to bend over and lube up. 28.00. and this was on a non event week day. The buckets and entrees are fairly reasonable. 

You pay more to park than almost two meals. Get with metro parking authority or it will kill your business"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I brought a party of 15 here on short notice. They were very accommodating and nice to our whole party. The seasonal drinks are very good with good variety. Flatbread pizzas were great as were the lettuce wraps. Two favorites for entrees were the brine pork chop and sea bass. Both were delicious.  Only negative we heard from anyone was the steak was a little under seasoned. This is one of the best restaurants around and should be on you list to eat at.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Many service people seemed to huddle. Had to wait be seated with one group ahead of us and plenty of open tables. Slow to respond to drink order. Took food order promptly. Slow to serve food. No silverware had to go get myself. No one asked if everything was ok. Appears to only be only 2 point of sale machines which draws a crowd. Food was very good and with great flavor had shrimp, grouper tacos, fish spread. Very proud of margarita's, not worth $10."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had a great experience today: was back in the neighborhood and wanted to visit. Even though busy, I got my order in good time. The bourbon coffee today had a unique taste that complimented the maple bacon crepe. Thumbs up for the cook today! Any bacon lover would be in heaven with this order. Perfect amount of sweet and savory. Stinks that that rewards were done but not to worry, still worth it. Just means I have to come back again for my free cuppa."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Everything about Lamara is incredible aside from the manager. She is very rude in general and will yell at you if you sit at a laptop free table. I have now been to Lamara a handful of times and all of my interactions with her have been negative so far. However, all of my interactions with the workers at Lamara have been overwhelmingly positive and friendly. Aside from the manager's horrid attitude, the food is delicious, the drinks are heavenly and the space is beautiful."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Compares to Chipotle with regard to their menu. That's where the resemblance ends. Andale is far superior. The people are super friendly and helpful. The food is fresh and delicious. When you walk in the door the smell is absolutely amazing. I usually get a bowl with rice, veggies and the carnitas (pork). I keep meaning to try more things but it's so delicious, I have a hard time not ordering it every time I go. This place is a gem. You won't be disappointed."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I usually stay in the warehouse district when in NO, so the FLamingo is a great spot to grab a late night drink or a decent meal.  The red fish with collards did not disappoint.
We had a large group, so we sat in the courtyard area and it was a fun evening.
The pre-made drinks are a little sweet for my taste, but their beer selection is always good and they do have a full bar.
Will definitely drop in again next time I'm in town."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Lorenzo's has passable hoagies and depending on who is working, they can be excellent. However, it's hit or miss. Their delivery takes forever (average 1 hour), the delivery guys are often surly and the warm food, whenever it does arrive, is cold, and soggy. The breakfasts are large and filling, but how hard is it to screw up scrambled eggs and scrapple. We've been customers there for 3 years, and unfortunately, the inconsistent quality and increasingly poor delivery service makes us wanna go anywhere else."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Really bad service, the person working at the counter made it clear that she didn't want to serve us.  She initially ignored us and was very snippy.  It was crazy given that we just ordered coffees and muffins.  I've never been made so clearly to feel like we were not welcome at a restaurant that is open.  There are a number of places that serve similar items, I would suggest you go to any one of them instead of this place."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I absolutely LOVE Korean fried chicken, so finally checked this place out! Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, the bulgogi bibimbap, and the tteokbokki. All were delicious! Particularly loved the tteokbokki, which was spicy and sweet and loaded with tons of rice cakes. Sandwich was unfortunately a little soggy from being steamed in it's wrapping during our transit, but I'm sure when it's fresh it's much better. Love having these traditional Korean flavors so close to me, definitely check it out if you have a craving!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Gumbo! Dark, rich, and salty and full of shrimp, oysters, chicken, and Andoullie sausage, served with a few rounds of light French bread. So good. My husband got a Reuben, which was good and drippy, but come on, it's New Orleans, let's go for it, right? We also got a side of fries because the sandwiches come fry-less (!!). My husband wanted me to specifically write that the fries are ""too short,"" ha. I thought they were fine. I'm still thinking about that gumbo, though!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"One of the best PDQ restaurants in the area. I will be back for sure!  Can't wait to go back. This place is fantastic! Great food, great service, great atmosphere. We went on a Friday night around 8:30pm and it was packed. The wait staff was very friendly and quick to take our drink orders. The place is very clean and the staff is very professional."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,This used to be the go to place for Vietnamese food but it's now just a go-to. The food is always great. The staff is always friendly and the food is always hot and fresh. The only reason this is not 5 stars is because the service is always great. I have never had a problem with the servers and they always seem so happy to take care of my needs.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This was my first visit here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place.The food is good, but the service is not. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We went for lunch on a weekday and the food was good.  Service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  I will definitely return and recommend to others.Great food and great service. We went on a Friday night around 8:30. The restaurant was very busy. We were seated right away. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided us with great recommendations. I had the salmon with pork belly and
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"We usually go on Tuesdays, but I thought the fried chicken was pretty good. I was disappointed to find that the fried chicken wasn't as good as the fried chicken in the pictures. The chicken was a little bland, but I would have liked it if it had been fried more. I think it's just a bad day for them. They also have a really great draft beer selection."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Renaud's sits tucked away in a strip mall with a parking lot full of restaurants, bars, and other other shops. The place is small and is a little tight inside, but it's worth it. It's a little pricey for what you get, but it's worth it. The food is excellent, the drinks are good, and the atmosphere is a little rough around the edges."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This based only on the actual food and the service. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but that is the only reason I gave 4 stars.The food was great. The server was nice and attentive. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I got the fried oyster appetizer and it was so good. I wish I would have gotten the shrimp and"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Tried this  new restaurant and it was amazing! We started with the pulled pork sandwich and the fries. The sandwich was amazing. The fries were crispy and seasoned to perfection. The mac and cheese was awesome and the bacon was so fresh. The customer service was great as well. The only downside was that the bathroom was dirty and it was very loud and loud. I wish I could go back just for the food and drink
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Tried this place for the first time and the food was good.  The cheese steak was awesome.  The mac and cheese was a bit too salty for my taste.  I would definitely go back.  It was good enough to keep me from going back to this place.I'm always a fan of this place!  I'm not sure if it's a new owner or just a new staff, but I love"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This restaurant and chef were both amazing and the food was amazing. 

The food is cooked to perfection.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is clean and well kept.  

The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients they use.  They are always very helpful and know their customers.  

They have a great selection of wines and spirits to choose from."

Restaurants,2.5,OR,"I've been here a couple of times now and my experience is always the some. The food is fresh and up to Burger King standards. But is anything but ""fast"" food. Fifteen minutes is not acceptable from the time an order is placed until the time our order is complete. IF this location could speed things up to a reasonable order delivery time it would be one of the best Burger King locations I've ever been to. I don't go here when I'm in a hurry."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"One of the best BLACK OWNED RESTAURANTS in the city. I have visited this restaurant 5 times since they opened, and each time has been great. The customer service is superb, ambiance is beautiful, music great, daiquiris great( my favorite is Lick Me Down) and the food has been delicious each time. My favorite dishes from Willies B""s are : Spinach, Buffalo Shrimp, Chicken and Waffles and Lamb Chops. 

I will def be visiting again and I can't wait to try something new on the menu!!!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Best thing: location, views, the Tiramisu 

Worst thing:  tried 4 drinks on their menu, every single one beyond doubt was watered down.  It's just wrong to do that, I know it's common in touristy joints but it's not acceptable.  All drinks were just plain bad.

Food: the Shrimps dish in appetizer was good.  From mains, my grouper was over cooked and chewy, hubby's Rob Eye Steak was good.  The kids had Fettuccine, Salmon, surf n turf -  al very above average."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Our family ordered 5 footling subs for pick up. Three of the 5 were made incorrectly and one of those was not edible. Those three sandwiches were missing items and extra meat which we paid for. The one that was not edible was drenched in vinegar to the point the bread was soggy. The vinegar overwhelmed all the ingredients so it wasn't salvageable. I called the store, but The manager on duty was no help. He sounded totally incompetent and offered no help."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Food was really good ! I had the Chicago dog with fried pickles & DH had a Corn Dog & onion rings. They were quick & tasty - loved the onion rings - very light batter which I prefer- definitely not a frozen item! The only reason I have it 4 stars  instead of 5 is because the one & only bathroom was so dirty- obviously not been cleaned in a very long time - maybe never? Holy cow- wipe stuff down at least occasionally!!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My husband and I went there for lunch today with our daughter. I was shocked when I was told they didn't have a high chair. Or even a kids menu.  I agree there are particular places to leave the kids at home. However, I don't consider this a fine dining establishment. Which is shocking since their decor says otherwise. The food is good and we frequented a lot prior to becoming parents. However, I was left with a sour taste in my mouth after today."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,We visited Carpenteria to get some driftwood on the beach.  While visiting we were checking on Yelp where to have brunch.  It was a Sunday and two of the restaurants with high reviews were closed.  We went to another restaurant and did not like menu or vibes.  We ended up at Pass to Beach Grill and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was great and the atmosphere even better.  We will be returning soon and have recommended it to many people.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went for taco Tuesday and the hostess was very helpful. We weren't sure how much people would be in our group and the staff were so accommodating. I would recommend making reservations because the wait can get very long. They have $2 tacos and some really good drink specials. I definitely recommend the slamgria! The red, white, and champagne are all good it really just depends on personal preference and what you're in the mood for. You can also order a tiramisu or shot for birthdays."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Had a great bday lunch here on our vacation . They helped us celebrate the occasion w bday confetti on the table  which was a pleasant surprise . Everyone who helped or served us gave my husband well wishes . We ordered a bit of everything... and it all was deliciously good . We enjoyed our time here very much . A special shout out to the well trained / seasoned staff. ( I didn't have to ask for anything ...our server was great !)
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great selection of beers on tap and very friendly and prompt bar service. Love the vibe and it's a great place to watch a game. It's also one of my favorite places for a burger -- the South of the Border and the Bulls Eye burgers are fantastic -- and they have a great selection of other sandwiches (all at great prices.)  Only downside is food sometimes takes awhile coming out of the kitchen, but you shouldn't mind with the good drinks and people watching."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I ate here the last two nights, as well. I went back to the Workz sub and that's easily my favorite so far. Of all the sides, the fries seem to be the most reasonably priced for what you get. They're delicious, nothing special, but really good. The meatball and provolone sub I had the other night wasn't as good as Subway's, honestly, but it was still really good. If I were to come here once and only once, I'd recommend the Workz sub, for sure."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I ordered two dishes on the menu and the food was good but not spectacular. I would recommend the gnocchi and the duck, both of which were very tasty. The dessert was a dessert of a little chocolate pie. I would have liked to have had more of the dessert but the portions were generous.

We did have a great time and will definitely be back!I love this place! I came here for a quick"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We were driving from Philly and decided to give it a shot. The food was good. The burrito was a bit small but the flavor was good. The rice was good. It was good size. The carne asada was very good. The service was great. The manager was very nice. He was very attentive and very professional.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Great smaller sports bar. My go to is the bar. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to watch a game, then the bar is pretty great.I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to enjoy it with a friend. I will say that the food was pretty good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We live nearby and eat here a lot. We usually get the chicken salad, the shrimp and grits, and the fries. The fries are crispy, seasoned, and great. The chicken salad is a little smaller than the grouper sandwich. I would come here again.Great food, great service. 
The atmosphere is very nice and the service was excellent. 
The burger was very good, but I wish there was"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,As a Peruvian I am not a huge fan of fried rice but I did like the rice and beans.  The burrito was a bit small but the flavor was good.  The rice was a little crunchy but good.  The beans were ok.  I ordered the chorizo tacos.  They were the most flavorless taco I have had.  The chips were good but I would recommend them to someone else

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. 

The customer service was great. The manager was very kind and informative. 

I would definitely recommend this place to others. I will definitely be back!Delicious food and service! I will definitely be back. The staff is super friendly"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I went to Stella two days in a row and decided to try it for the first time. The atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly and the food is tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was that the bread was extremely thick. I was hungry so I had to take a bite. I ended up going with the lamb gyro and it was excellent. I also got a gyro with gyro meat and it"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I do NOT do reviews here. The food is just ok. The service is terrible. If you go here, don't expect a ""star"" or ""star"" for your experience.The food was great. The server was a bit lazy. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I got the fried oyster appetizer and it was so good. I wish I would have gotten the shrimp and grit"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,I just walked into this place and couldn't even get served so I have no idea how the food taste so it doesn't really matter. I was the only one up at the register and there was no one there but two cooks back there cooking and no cashier. I looked out and saw two different people cleaning tables but they ignored the fact that I was standing there waiting to order and after a few minutes I had to leave and go to work.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I wish I would have taken a picture for this reciew. But it's too late. The pizza is all gone.  Wonderful customer service, fresh ingredients, and a locally owned business. How could you go wrong? At first I thought it was  too far of a drive, but it was well worth it. The owner was there, or at least I think it was him. Anyways he was extremely friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be returning. Yummy, yummy pizza! What a gem this place is!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I'm from out of town and was looking for a New York style pizza. Boy, did I ever find it in Luca's. You walk in and the aroma of pizza is mouth watering.  The place was immaculately clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I got the 16"" supreme and it was freaking awesome! Loaded with cheese and toppings and the sauce was fresh, delicious and robust. .  Please, if you are looking for a New York style pizza, give them a try."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Excellent spot! We over ate since we had just came back from being out in the water on jet skies but it was worth every penny. My mom and I started out with the large Greek salad. We then ordered a pizza with pepperoni and olives. Finally we topped it off with cakes and a Cannoli with espresso. We had a lot of leftovers!! We apprentice the waitress not judging our rough looks for being out in the water all day. :) Everything tasted fresh and great!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We arrived here about 10am after another breakfast was at capacity and didn't want to wait any longer. We waited in line about 5 minutes before being seated. The wait staff were very nice and accommodating. I had a pancake, bacon and a mimosa. Others had pancakes, pork chops, hash browns and eggs. The service was good but the food wasn't anything spectacular. Some of the items came out cold and the porkchop tasted reheated. The mimosa was good and strong but I  probably wouldn't return."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is my favorite sushi location in the... wait for it... COUNTRY!!!

I was visiting a friend in Nashville and she suggested we come here for good sushi. Boy was she right! 

The location is kind of unassuming and its certainly nothing fancy inside, just darn delicious food.

I still dream of the ginger dressing on the salad and can't wait to make my way back here to enjoy that and any number of their yummy rolls. Samurai will be my first stop when I'm back in Tennessee."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Im from Maui and enjoyed the food here. I ordered the 3 meat plate, teri beef, adobo and kalua pork. The teriyaki beef was slightly on the tough side so after a few pieces I abandoned ship on that. However the adobo and kalua pork was delicious. Very juicy. So juicy that I will ask for two scoop of rice next time. The toasted sweet roll was a nice little addition. Food is cooked to order so there may be a couple minute wait, but worth it."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Walked over here from Agave Inn because it has good reviews. Customer service wasn't great. We weren't greeted they just looked at us. We figured out you have to grab a menu, order at the counter, and seat yourself and they bring it to you. The cafe mocha latte and the chai tea latte were good! But the pancake breakfast $14 and the American breakfast $13 were ok not worth the price. They didn't check up on us but could be because it's not full waiter service."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The absolute BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever had, anywhere! The chicken salad is tangy and is always piled high -- the amount that escapes from your sandwich is almost enough for another meal. Lots of crisp lettuce and the apples truly set this sandwich apart. Add a side of their amazingly delicious bean salad, and you've got quite the lunch!

It's a small spot, so sometimes service can take a little longer, but it's so worth the wait. Nice people there too! LOVE this lunch spot!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This was a first.....we pulled up to the hotel/restaurant for Sunday brunch, and were promptly told that there was NO parking available on the premises due to the lots being full. The valet was very dismissive and told us that we could park at a distance that would require a 15 minute walk in the hot sun back to the hotel. Needless to say, we went elsewhere. What a disappointment and a poor example of service for a property that holds itself out there as high end."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"OMG Ok Where Do I Even Start --

I Never Write Reviews BUT Gina's Was So Amazing I Had To!!!

Gina Was The Best & So Sweet, It Felt Like Home! 
The Service Was Amazing & Loved The Environment! 
Me & My Boyfriend Travel A lot & LOVE To Try The Best Local Foodie Spots & We Are So Glad We Found This Gem, OBSESSED Is An Understatement  (highly recommend the mushroom soup, wings & cats pasta dish) 

Can't wait to eat at Gina's again!!!! 
Highly Recommend --"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The atmosphere is the only reason I gave it two stars. The waiters are rude and the food is not very good. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting a lot from the food. I got the steak taco and it was not very good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is one of the few places I've ever been able to find vegetarian food in the area.

I had the Chicken Tenderloin, which was a great choice. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the broth was perfect. The noodles were very creamy and flavorful. The texture of the chicken was very good and the flavor was very fresh.

I've also tried the Chili Cheese Paneer, which was pretty good"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Received excellent service on Valentine's Day. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The mac and cheese was awesome and the bacon was so fresh. The customer service was great as well. The only downside was that the bathroom was dirty and it was very loud and loud. I will definitely be back for a great meal!This place is
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I have been hearing mouthwatering about this place for a year now. The food is always delicious and the service is always great. I have had take out and delivery from here and everything is always good. I love the portions and the variety of the food. The only downside is that the delivery time can be a little longer than I like.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Russell our bartender made our evening an amazing one! We started with a bottle of the local cider. We had the prime rib and a glass of wine. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and cooked to perfection. It was served on a bed of tender tender and juicy meat. The sauce was flavorful and the rib was tender and juicy. The wine was made on site and was really great. I had the salmon with the macaroni and
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I ordered delivery from La Toscana. It arrived quickly and was delicious. I ordered the chicken enchilada and the veggie quesadilla. Both were very good. My wife had the chicken burrito which was very flavorful. My brother had the chicken enchilada. It was very good and he also enjoyed his meal. The only thing that I didn't like was that there was not enough salsa.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I'm literally giving Neyow's 4 stars because the food is just ok. 

The food is ok. 

The service is ok. 

But the drinks are pretty bad. 

The food is ok. 

I really don't know how this place gets a 2.5 star rating. I'm not sure if it's a bad thing or just a bad thing, but I'm"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Me and a friend came here for the first time. It was a lovely date night and the staff was so friendly. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that they were charging for the special cocktails. I would have loved to have ordered the special cocktails and gotten them separately but I felt like I was being charged more. I was very surprised to see that they actually had
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Server left for the evening and I was hoping to try something else. When I got home, the food was not the best I've had. The chicken was dry and the sauce was thick. The lettuce was not fresh. I would not recommend.I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant and was looking for a quick dinner. I went to Taco Bell on a whim and I was very impressed. The food was very good and the portions"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I was told this is the place to go to. I chose to go for the sushi and the atmosphere was great. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. I will definitely go back. The best in the area. The food is always fresh and delicious. The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating. I recommend this place. I ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived 15 minutes after I placed it.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We really enjoyed our meal here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place. The food was good, but the service was not. Our server was extremely rude and just didn't care."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place was great.  It had exactly what we were expecting and needed after a weekend of ""fine dining"" in New Orleans.  Their baked oysters were ridiculous.  I'm not sure what they do to them to make them taste so damn good, but I want to learn how to make love the way that they bake their oysters.

This is a perfect ""last day in NOLA"" meal while your stomach is still catching up and your ass is a little sore from riding the mechanical bull."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Simply amazing.  Everything I wanted in a barber.  Would I get a perm there... nope.  Want a great men's haircut and a perfect beard trip with a straight edge.  1000%. Most barbershops don't take the time to shave the outside of the beard (by the ear)... he does.  It makes it really sharp.  All for 1/2 the price of the fancy shops.

Give it a try... you really won't regret it.  You don't even need to make an appointment, just walk in..."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"A delicious and fun place for pretty much anything on a bagel.

After a hankering for salmon, veggies, and cream cheese on a bagel, Jack's puts it all together very nicely. And for those heartier breakfast days, their Chorizo and Eggs on a bagel really hits the spot. They offer eggs any way and scrambles, and we still have lots to try here.

Comfy outdoor seating area, with a nice selection of coffees too. Total comfort food.

This Jack's is located on Milpas, right after the round-about next to Hwy 101."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My wife and I went there on the way to pick up a rental car. Different than what I had expected. On the smallish side 10 tables. Very clean and the food was good. We both had eggs , I had potatoes and my wife had bacon. Everything came out hot and quick. The Bagels were different looked more like a roll shape but very good. 
So for just over $13 we both had breakfast and were full. Can't ask for too much more in a breakfast place."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"First time trying this local restaurant with some friends and there was some good, and some not so good and so it gets 3 stars.  The good was no wait time, friendly staff, the catfish -shrimp - red beans - side dishes - and beer/bar selection. The not so good was the jambalaya - decor (lots of Christmas lights) and it was pricey.  We will go there again and try some other things because they do have alot on their menu (the fried chicken looked interesting)"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,I had lunch here today with a friend and ordered the house salad and a single slice of pizza. The salad was very good but the bottom of the pizza was so burnt it was hard to chew. I decided to try and and use the fork and knife and even the knife couldn't cut it. I regret not asking for an unburned piece. I won't be in a big hurry to eat here again as there are too many other good places to eat in that area.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Not much to add about Indy's favorite brunch place-it is consistently wonderful, beautiful, delicious, and delightful. I eat here on the regular and have never had a bad meal. I always tell myself to try something other than the ""omelet of the day,"" but that rarely happens. Cinnamon toast = craving worthy. Excellent iced-tea and they always give me a ""to go"" cup. Perfect place for meeting friends, surprising your mom, or dragging your husband. Everyone is happy and it's pretty much perfect. I should probably move here."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Came here for breakfast today for the first time in years and it was great. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it's one of the best ones I've had. You feel like you're down the shore here with the decor featuring a lot of Ocean City related items and the constant flow of people. 

Giving 4 out of 5 stars because it took a bit longer to get our food and a couple things were forgotten, but overall it was great. I'll definitely be back here for breakfast!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Been here a few times. The drinks are reasonably priced, and it really is like having a craft cocktail in your own house. We were there last night, and a gentleman named Jason helped us with our grill. GREAT guy, very helpful and made us feel welcome.  Our group brought some steaks, bought a few more from Pignic, and had LOTS of great drinks.  My only gripe was an employee named Greg. Kind of in-your-face rude. Well, no place is perfect. We'll definitely be back again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Quintessential South Philly.  ""How many, hon, two?"" is usually how they greet you, big hair and all.   My husband has been a fan of PR for years..he usually gets breakfast special #1, which is delicious and a bargain.  Today we were there for lunch.  My wedding soup was fantastic, and our bread basket had BANANA bread in it! That sounds strange, but it was yummy!!! If you're looking for a place to dine before or after the Phillie's game, you can't beat Penrose."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Call ahead order - 25 min in advance, and STILL had to wait for my order when I got there (2 sandwiches and a bag of chips, nothing crazy). My biggest issue, however, is that every single employee in the joint was pissy, clearly looks like they hate life, and the attitude is horribly evident to guests. It's uncomfortable and, as a guest paying $10/sandwich, certainly makes me not want to return. Management should seriously consider switching up staff as this crew is not meant for customer service."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Was told about this place by a friend and we decided to try it out. I was pretty impressed. The food was delicious. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The mac and cheese was awesome. It was a little pricey for what it is. The service was also good. We were seated right away. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great burger place.This place has the best food and service.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Someone at work brought in a bunch of food and drinks for us. When we got home, we noticed that we had missed the appetizer and then the dessert. After a long wait, we decided to order the salmon and grouper sandwich. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the grouper was a great size. I did not have the crab cakes, but they were really good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking"
Restaurants,5.0,CG,"This place is really good. We had the Ribeye and the Mac & Cheese. I would recommend. I had the burrito and a friend had the chicken burrito. The burrito was pretty good. The chicken was good, but nothing special. My friend had the chicken burrito and said it was pretty good. I did get a side of the rice with the rice. I will say that the rice was pretty good."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place is a gem! We had the crab cake and the shrimp and grits. Both were fantastic. The shrimp and grits were delicious and the crab cake was so flavorful. The crab cake was a little smaller than I like, but it was still very good. If you have the time to spare, this is the place to go. I ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived 15 minutes after I placed it."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Always lived closed to The Hill for 20 years and never heard of this place until I went there. I had the burrito and a friend had the chicken enchilada. The burrito was huge and the chicken enchilada was huge. I got two large plates for $9.99 and they were the most delicious meal I have had in a long time. I will definitely be back.Came here for my birthday on
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I above above this place, it's a chain. I'm not sure if I'm just being a little too harsh, but I think they're the better of the two chains. The food is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is cool. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone looking to try some of the food.Delicious food and service!  I love the grilled salmon with the macaroni and cheese"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Best selection of beer in Tampa. The food is good too. 

The only thing is that the service is a bit slow. 

I think this place is going to be a five star place in the future.I've been going to this place for almost 3 years and it's always good. I've always had great service and great food. I like the cheesesteak sandwich, but I've never had anything on"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I used to go here, and it was the best fried chicken in town! The chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauces were spot on.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the sauce was spicy and not overly sweet.  The mashed potatoes were very good as well.  I had a chicken salad with a side of greens, and it was great.  The bread was perfect, and the chicken was cooked to perfection. "
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Melo, our server from New Orleans. The food was amazing. My husband had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp were seasoned perfectly, and the grits were tasty. The gumbo was amazing. We will definitely be back. I came here for the first time today. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"In a Pat's v. Geno's, it's the best burger I've ever had. I'm not a big burger fan, but I am a big fan of Pat's. The burger is thick, juicy, and full of flavor. 

I ordered the ""Crispy Peg Leg"" Burger. It's a thin bun with a sweet, crunchy patty. It's served with a grilled cheese with pickles"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I almost did not go to this wonderful restaurant because of previous reviews.  I am Mexican and therefore am very picky. There were 7 in our party, mostly different dishes: guacamole, salsas, tamales, posole, steak, sopes and chili/cheese- ALL WONDERFUL!! Flavorful!! What I personally loved, no digestive after effect!! The pricing is reasonable for the amount of food, which is plenty, and  especially for the area. So much food we needed to go boxes. We are all average eaters, not twigs,so my comment on portions is realistic."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Oh. My. Word. Best crab cakes ever. Ever!! Huge menu! It was hard to pick a meal because they all sounded good and looked great as waiters delivered food to nearby tables. Super friendly staff. I was traveling alone, and they weren't weird about that like many restaurants get. I was there at a busy time, but only had about a 5 minute wait, and my server did not try to rush me. I loved the place so much that I ate there a second time on my trip!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"A good local place. It looks like a regular pizza place from the street, but it's actually set up like a diner on the inside. 

I got a hot corned beef sandwhich and fries. The sandwhich and the fries were both great. I picked up the order and it was ready as soon as I got there; no waiting. 

Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this place. One of my former co-workers was a regular here, and I look forward to trying additional things on their menu."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'm torn about giving this restaurant 3 stars...but, the food & service deserved it.  I have a few issues which I will address directly to the owner via email.  Let me say the food/plate presentation was great, the flavors that came out of this small kitchen nook was wonderful and the service we received at the bar was excellent.  The down side was beer/wine only...but, that's ok.  give this cozy little diner style restaurant on the beach a try.  Not bad for the money."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This is the BEST breakfast I have had in the Treasure Valley in a very long time. The food was first and foremost actually hot! I had started to expect lukewarm but this food was hot. The flavors were incredible. I mean incredible.  I had a scramble and my husband had French toast and they were both out of this world and neither one was a ""most ordered"" item. Can't wait to go back and try some more awesome food. Also, the service was friendly and high quality."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"great brunch spot that's close by Jackson Square and wasn't super crowded on the weekday. my friends and i were promptly seated and had our orders taken quickly. i went for the Breaux Bridge Benedict, which did not disappoint! it was cooked perfectly with the runny yolk and was complimented well with the housemade boudin and smoked ham. i definitely could have had more of that boudin! service was excellent and efficient. definitely worth a stop by if you're around Jackson Square and looking for a nice brunch spot."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place was ridiculously expensive. $84 for 2 games of bowling?! Their bumpers didn't work. The see we came in with a 3 year old and offered no kids ball or ramp (and again, the bumpers were broken!). We were almost through our whole first game when we eventually had to go find someone to get a drink and order food. The pizza was ok but the other food not so much. The drinks were $10.50 a piece for about 6 ounces of beer. Poor service and overly priced"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The sushi is a bit overpriced and a bit underwhelming.  I've had better, but I've also had worse.  The delivery was fast, but the not the fastest...or the slowest.  I may go back, I may not.  I can't make up my mind as to whether this is something worth having again, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for now.  Good thing this isn't a six star rating system, I'd have a moral dilemma as to whether it deserves 3 or 4 stars."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is amazing. I come here a lot to eat when I have a lunch break from school. They have the best pud thai, I love the coconut soup ( I can never remember the name) but I do recommend this place. The service is amazing their menus are adorable to look at and the atmosphere is really nice. The food is fairly priced. My boyfriend and I always order chicken pud thai, coconut soup, golden triangle, 2 thai teas it came around to 30 dollars including tip."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Bazille reminds me of a European Bistro -  cozy, wood-burning fire, lots of small/shareable plates - bisque, sandwiches.   Full bar and good wine selections by the glass.   The crab bisque is excellent.  Tried the deviled eggs - good  - but could use a little more seasoning.  Lime shrimp salad is delicious and filling.  Easy to get to Bazille - even if you work in West Shore or downtown.  Just park outside Norstrom's and go up to the second floor."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Delicious! We are always looking for a great local spot. I will definitely be back!Very good. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little spicy but the flavor was good. The burrito was a little bland but it was very good.
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"I like the atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely come back!Very good.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection. It was very tender, flavorful and tender. I also had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was very good too. I think the breading could use some salt, but I like the texture and taste."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"For the only Boston Market in town, the food is good, but the service is slow and the prices are too high. I will not be returning to this location.Great food and great service. We went on a Friday night around 8:30. The restaurant was very busy. There were a lot of people at the bar, but the bartenders were very friendly and attentive. They offered us drinks, but I chose the Mac and cheese and"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This was my second time here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We were looking forward to eating here and it was not worth the wait. I've been here several times and have had great experiences.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Yummy!  When visiting Philly, this place is a must try!

The cheese steak was awesome.

The burrito was a solid 4 stars!

This place is a great place to take your family out to enjoy a good meal.This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we were very disappointed. We ordered the crab cake appetizer and my husband had the pork chop entree"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We were a group of four and the hostess was very rude. When we got to the front she said we had to leave, but that she would be right back to bring us our food. When we left we were told that they were out of wings and that we had to wait for a table. We were the only ones in the restaurant and we waited for about 30 minutes. I was very disappointed with the service."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I like Panera Bread. Healthy, tasty, and filling. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to get your food to you, you can't go wrong with this place. I'll be back. I will most likely be going back to Panera Bread for the food.I love this place!  I love the atmosphere and the food is so good.  I live in Philly and I love the atmosphere and"
Restaurants,1.5,CG,had to give one star because of the fact that they don't have happy hour. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and the waffles had a lot of rice. The chicken was not fresh at all. The waffles were very dry and the sauce was not flavorful. The chicken was also not hot and the batter was very hard. I will definitely not go back here again.Came here for my birthday on a
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Penn Valley Pub is a nice place to go if you're in the mood for a local pub.I've had the best experience here.  The staff was friendly and the food was delicious.  I ordered the salmon and I'm glad I did.  The salmon was very flavorful and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I also got the crab cakes and they were so good.  I will definitely be back.I used to love this place
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"The chicken (legquarter), fries, special (shrimp and grits), and chicken salad were all delicious. The chicken was moist and delicious. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The other entrees were okay, but not outstanding. 

I would come back to try the other items on the menu. I love the atmosphere and the food is good. I think the prices could be a bit higher, but I think the"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Hotel shuttle was a no show. If you need a ride to the airport just call uber

They expect you to wait outside in the cold and then tell you you must have not been there and that's why the shuttle didn't swing by the magnolia entrance

Bad end to an otherwise great stay.

Never imply that The fault is customers when you've they've been standing in he cold and now possibly late for flight!

Not my usual Marriott experience but called uber and they were there in 3 min
Should have done that anyway"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Decided to have breakfast here since it was so close to the hotel I was staying at and had such great  reviews. The food did not disappoint! My mouth literally waters every time I think about their eggs Benedict. I highly recommend getting the Peacemaker so you can mix & match! I got one corned beef & one chicken st Charles (fried chicken obvs). They were SO good. Can't wait to go back to Nola just to eat here again, till then I'll just dream about those eggs Benedicts."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is a great place for a burger! My favorite thing - actually it was the first thing I ever ordered and I just haven't strayed since - is the Kyle Burger and the small Ahi salad. The burger has always been good and the Ahi salad is so good and fresh. I typically call in the order (easiest thing to do on the go for me) and the staff/service is always good and efficient. 
Also, supporting this business also supports a really great cause, which is a huge plus!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We ordered the feast and I would say that the beef brisket was the best and really the star. It was tender and really juicy. The chicken and ribs are a little dry and would prefer that to fall off the bone. The sides needs more work such as adding more seasoning. It was too bland for my taste. If they work on these items then it would be a great complement to the meats. The place atmosphere is really great and nice concept. I would still go back there.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great lunch stop on our Black Friday adventure in city center area.... none of us was very hungry and my two teens were a bit put off by the menu which didn't have many normal offerings. My daughter got the Mac n cheese and was really really impressed (she's considers herself an expert), and my grumpy son got the pork street tacos and loved them (they looked delicious with perfect-looking meat). I had the fish and chips- fish was perfectly done, moist without greasiness which is very hard to find."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This was my place of choice for many years! I don't often get back to the area, but when I do I make sure to drop in. 
A beer lover could never go wrong here, and they usually have at least 2 kinds of cider (my poison of choice) 
The fries are to die for, as are many items on the menu. It can get loud in the bar area, but there is plenty seating elsewhere. 
Be sure to check the gigantic specials chalkboard, but the menu is great regardless."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Took my son to see our friend fight for an MMA title and he told us we should have a cheesesteak here even though he's never had one(gotta stay on weight) We've had them in NJ and they were good, this was better but honestly it's a simple sandwich. Was a little cold since it was winter and the place is an outdoor place with some plastic. But who am I to complain the food was really good and they had lots of free pickles and peppers on the side."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Delicious shrimp poboys dressed.  If you want the real deal then make your way out of the FQ to Parkway.  For about $13.00 you can get a regular shrimp poboy, sweet potatoe fries, and a drink.  And they are very generous with the shrimp.  Thus far, I've had poboy's at Acme and Johnny's.  In my humble opinion, Parkway blows them both out the water!   I can't wait to go back to try out the surf & turf - roast beef and shrimp poboy."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I had a terrible lunch experience after wasting $17 on a terrible tasting cheeseburger meal. The service is great at this place, no complaints at all. The beef patty in my burger had such a bad flavor to it(the beef flavor itself) that I couldn't bear to continue eating my burger. The fries where a bit undercooked and still hard from the inside. It's very upsetting to see such a simple meal be served at such low quality, it looks great but it tastes trash. $3. 29 coke
$10. 29 burger
$3 tip
 Total $17."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The food was fresh, delicious, and colorful. We enjoyed the Veggie Rico, Fish Fritters, and Esmeralda salad. The meal was a refreshing break from the fried food we've been eating mostly. I'm giving only four stars, however, because the service was lack luster. Both the hostess and our server were aloof, not attentive and generally not excited or friendly at all (almost seemed annoyed). Maybe other servers are great, but our experience was not the best. Stop here for delicious and healthy food, and hopefully some better service than us!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I've been going to Mi Toscana for over 15 years now. The food is always fresh and delicious. The service is always great. The staff is always friendly and always willing to make you feel welcome. It's a great place for a date night or to grab some good Mexican food. They also have a great beer selection. I can't wait to go back!I love this place. It's so fun to watch the chefs go by
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place used to be a staple in the area. I will admit that I have been wanting to go back since the early 90's.  The food was okay. The service was ok. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of staff. We were seated at a table and it took a while to get our drinks. We ordered the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork tenderloin and the chicken sandwich"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,I went through the drive thru and the woman who took my order was very rude. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the lady said they're the best chicken in town. I was charged for my order and when I got home they were cold. I don't know how long the cold food took but I was going to get a salad but the salad was cold. I asked for a refund and she said I had to go to the manager because
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I swung by here after hearing about the food and decided to try it out. I was pretty impressed. The food was delicious. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and great. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fry was on the cold side. The fries were also not crispy enough. The place was clean and nicely decorated. I would definitely come back here. I just wish there was more beer on tap."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I would have given this place a 3.5. I will say that the service was horrible. Our waiter was very attentive but not at all friendly. He didn't take our order and we had to ask for refills on our drinks. He then brought our food and brought out the food a second time. I will say that the food was good and I think the portions were generous for the price. The manager was nice and made sure we had
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We sat down and 10 minutes later the hostess came out and apologized for the wait. 

We had the best time, and the food was amazing. 

I highly recommend this place and will be back.I came here for the first time today. The staff was great. The place was clean and the owner was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly. The salmon was cooked perfectly"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place is popular with locals and tourists alike.  I will admit that I have been there twice since opening.  The first time was with my boyfriend and we had a great time.  The second time we were with a group of about 15.  The food was good, the service was fast and friendly.  I will say the last time we were there was with a group of 4.  The first time was with a group of 3"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place reminds me a lot of the other places in Nashville. 

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty.  I've been to many other places and this place is a bit different.  I don't know how many people love it. 

I think it's a great place to eat out if you're looking for a great spot to catch a show or to go to some"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"Food is okay lacks flavor. Not sure if the food is good but it's just not what you expect. If you want a nice, solid Italian restaurant, you're going to have to pay a bit more. It's not your typical Italian restaurant.This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we found the restaurant right on the beach. We got there around 4:30 and it was packed! The waitress was"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I just didn't feel it. We had the crab cake which was cold and my friend had the crawfish. The crawfish was overcooked. The sauce was bland and the crawfish was barely cooked. We ordered the shrimp and grits which were cold. The shrimp was very good. The grits were cold. I will not be going back.I came here for the first time last weekend. It was fantastic! I had the mussels
Restaurants,4.5,OR,We had a huge group and not only was the food excellent but the service was on point! We arrived a full hour early and they didn't have the staff there yet that were to service us. But the manager jumped in and they really made it go right. I have never been served this well when with a huge party. We were 26 people. The tacos were perfect. The cauliflower ceviche was soooo good I have to call and see if they'll share the recipe. Everything was perfect!! Thank you!!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Glad we made reservations!  Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 5 and they were busy but table was ready within short 5 min wait. Our group started with Brussel sprouts which were very flavorful and crispy. We also had Caesar salad and dressing had just the right amount of garlic. Two in our group selected pizza/ very happy with the thin crust! Also enough leftover for lunch next day. Spaghetti and meatballs also proved to be excellent choice!
Very friendly staff and prompt service."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"There are 26 Beef 'O' Brady restaurants in the Tampa Bay area, and over 200 more across seven states and growing. It is a family concept restaurant with a partial bar. The name makes you think that it is Irish in some form, but the menu is all classic comfort American foods. They have a good burger menu and lighter fare as well. My wife and I tried the lettuce wraps and the Amarillo firecracker burger. You can read the full and updated review at the Wine Dine and Play blog."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I read previous reviews about the staff being friendly and they definitely weren't kidding! I stopped by for a smoothie before a road trip and mentioned that it was my first time in their cute spot. They were nice enough to upgrade my small smoothie to a large at no additional cost. The prices are decent, they had a good amount of food available for sale and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. I will definitely be back and I can't wait to try their other juices!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Yummy yummy yummy. That's all I can say. Everything tasted so fresh. I loved how the ingredients are all local. We had the caeser salad which was perfect and refreshing. We ordered their famous pepperoni pizza which has a drizzle of honey on top. This was something totally different but the sweet and spicy was a great combination. We also had the chanterelle pizza. I didn't think I would like this bc it had truffle oil on it but I was wrong. It was another perfect pick.
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"We only came here because we have a gift card, still a mistake. Service was awful, lots of servers mucking about clueless. It wasnt busy at 4 when we came in still took forever. Highly recommend a HARD PASS. Besides listening to the highly drunk group of guys at the bar being entertained by the obnoxious bar tender just making it worse. PEACE OUT! (To top it off, I barely made it home before I was violently I'll, i can only guess it was from the food I had eaten there)"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Very much just okay. Pulled pork is a bit mushy, not bite/texture. The brisket is measly, chopped up too small and a bit dry. Portion for the meal regular is a bit small. Mac and cheese is decent but flavor is missing something to really bring it all together. Cool part is the variety of what they offer. I generally like loaded potatoes and loaded fries. Maybe with a bough tries you'll find something you truly like but you might spend over $10 each time to strike out before finding it."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,Very bad experience. They were trying a Fish Friday for $9.99. All you got was half piece of fish and 5 small shrimp. The cold slaw was warmer than the fries. My husband got water dripped on him from the air conditioning unit. Asked for the manager and the waitress was the manager. We go there at the very least once a week and still they did nothing about our experience. We had 8 people with us and everyone was unhappy about something with their order. Not sure I will return.
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"I wish I could give this place ZERO stars!! 
ROACHES RAINING FROM THE CEILING!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
I just left this place with my family (5/24/19 at 11pm) where a HUGE Cockroach fell from the ceiling and narrowly missed my head. The manager comes over and says ""this happens in New Orleans; you can check with the health department and we get 100% every time""!!! SERIOUSLY!! He never apologized and justified the roach infestation as a regular occurrence. I am still in disbelief!! HORRIBLE MANAGER!! HORRIBLE PLACE!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'm doing it!! I'm bumping this place up to 5 stars. Oh wait -- twas already there. Can I give it 6? 7?

I LOVE this place!! Considering how masterful their drinks are, now that I'm a somewhat regular, they also get an ""A+"" for consistency. Every drink is awesome. They don't take 20 mins to make. And, our service has been superb every time.

Find of the night: I topped off the evening with the Willett Rye Old Fashion -- except substituted a barrel aged Willett instead. There's no going back now!."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,oh my!!!  i have been here 3 times now and i will keep going back!Very good. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little tough to chew and it was very chewy. I think the pork was dry and had a very distinct flavor.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,First off let me say... We had the crab cakes which were amazing. The crab cake was one of the best we had in the area. The sauce was very tasty. The creamed spinach was also very good. The service was great. The waitress was very friendly and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back!Just stopped by for breakfast and it was a solid 3.5 stars.  This place has a nice atmosphere and nice staff.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Horrible experience. Came here to eat with my family and they were all very happy with the food and service. The food was mediocre at best and the drinks were not good either. I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to enjoy it with a friend. I will say that the food was pretty good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Tired of cooking at home, I decided to try something new. 

The food was good.  The drinks were good, but the food was not great.  I had the seafood platter and it was good, but nothing special.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was good but nothing to write home about.  My friend had the crab cake and she liked it but she liked it a lot more. 

"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,I have waited over 30 minutes for the food to come out.  When I got home the food was so cold that I couldn't eat it.  I sent the manager and he was so nice and apologetic.  I will never be coming back.I've been coming here for about a year now and I've been disappointed by the service and quality of the food.  I've had great experiences with the food and it's always good. 
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"There is usually a line, but the food is usually good. 

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The fries are thick, not crispy. It's a fryer, not a fryer. I ordered a full size and a half. I was disappointed. I'm not sure if it was a mistake or if it was just a bad day. Maybe I just don't like fries."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We ordered chips & salsa, an order of enchiladas & guacamole, and a couple of burritos.  The chips & salsa were pretty good, but the enchiladas & guacamole were absolutely awful.  The guacamole was cold, the chips were overly salty and the tortillas were too greasy.  I'd rather have my tacos cooked to perfection, but it was just too salty &"
Restaurants,5.0,CG,"I've been going to the Tampa location for years and never had a bad meal. I usually just order a burger and the fries. The fries are crispy, seasoned, and great. The burgers are good and fresh. The service is always good. If you come to Tampa you should definitely stop by.The place was packed and it took a while to get a table but the food was delicious! My husband had the pork chop and it was cooked perfectly."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Beers buy the glass are $2 and the food is $3. 25 each. I ordered the chicken burger and the fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The burger was ok. The chicken burger was not good. The fries were cold. I don't know how long the wait was. I was hoping the food would be good but the food was not. I will not be back. This place is not for everyone.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"UPDATE: We have been back here a couple of times. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but that is the only reason I give 4 stars.The food was great. The server was nice and attentive. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I got the fried oysters and the shrimp was a little salty. I liked my oysters better. I think it is a bit over"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We started with Polenta appetizer it was very tasty! Moving on to main course I had chicken Marsala and asked for extra sauce which i'm so glad I did because it was delicious and there were surprise potToes under the bed of spinach and chicken ! My fiancé got chicken parmigiana with the thought of saving some for later but it was so good he ate it all! Next time we will skip an appetizer and try the dessert !! We went on a. Saturday night and it was. A little loud.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Just opened for a soft opening and they are already amazing! 
To start, they have a great Happy Hour- the menu is small, but wonderful. We had the wings and the meatballs. Both are so flavorful! The portions are good if you aren't super hungry. 
For an entree, we had the rigatoni! The touch of balsam is really elevates the dish and it was so full of flavor!
Their bar is awesome and their drinks are amazing! We love this place and we are so excited to make it our go to spot!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,This spot is absolutely out of this world. Satellite took me and my wife to the upperstratosphere of wine heaven. We were there for the launch of their Monday night wine flights! The food was also on point. Small bites with huge artisinal flare. Drew and Wilson took exceptional care of us. Their wine list may be one of the best values for quality on State St. And everything can be taken away. This is my new go to for pre-show drinks and bites or after dinner night caps.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Friday evening drop in. It was fairly busy, no wait, but lots of to-go orders & the restaurant itself was full. They have an extensive menu, I just love pad Thai so it's always my easy go-to. The iced tea was strong and sweet, very good. My pad Thai had a combination of meats which I enjoyed. Their sauce was pretty spot on and I enjoyed the extra peanuts on the side. Good atmosphere in the heart of midtown, the staff was quick and efficient and our food was out soo fast."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Ever since the TomCat cafe closed in Reading, brunch has never been the same. And although Annamaries doesn't quite compare, it is still welllll deserving of many more visits. 

Long story short the quantity and quality you get on each plate is wonderful for the price. And we definitely ordered a bit too much  but hey. I love leftovers. So either way I can't wait to get back. 

It's pretty cramped and I assume they are always that way, so maybe arrive a little earlier than you plan on sitting down."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"First of all, the drive thru was super slow and there were only about 3 cars in front of me. It was 11:15am on a rainy Monday. I ordered a salad and then headed to a nearby dealership for an oil change. When I settled in and got my salad out, I had NO silverware and NO napkins!  I had to chase down a car dealer worker to find a fork and then go to a bathroom to get napkins. Needless to say, I'm not happy with Zaxby's at the moment!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Pros: 
- Convenient for when you're looking to feed an overworked sleep-deprived film crew at 6AM on a Sunday on a tight budget

Cons:
- Food is so bad that even overworked sleep-deprived film crew would rather starve 
- Eggs tasted like paper, toast tasted like cardboard, potatoes felt like decomposing fruits (not that I would know)

I cannot understand how they can mess up the most basic sides.. but hey, I guess they're not exactly known for their eggs, toast, and potatoes

Paying a bit more for Dunkin' Donuts sandwiches/croissants is much more worth it."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We stumbled upon this restaurant after some shopping in Jenkintown and decided to go in for lunch.  The restaurant has a great ambiance.  The food was marvelous!  Their bruschetta was on a flatbread style bread which was delicious.  I was impressed with the grilled shrimp on their salad and my sister enjoyed their mussels.  However, the service was very slow.  I'm not sure if this is always the case.  If you're in no rush and don't mind waiting, I would recommend trying this place out."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I  love coming to Primos. The staff is always friendly and accommodating, and always willing to go the extra mile. I'm always amazed at how fast my food is ready! They recently changed ownership and hired a bunch of new people, and even with all that going on they still offer up the best customer service I've ever experienced on a daily basis. And the food! Their  roast beef is to die for, and this month they are serving the Pilgrim, which tastes just like Mom used to make."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Fantastic beer selection. 

We ordered appetizers of hummus and wings which were pretty good and nothing special.   We had a hard time even finding a place at the bar it was so crowded. I went with a group of friends on a Wednesday night. It's also very vey loud and hard to hear but what do you expect from a bar. It's huge inside, much bigger then the outside and parking is a little crazy. I loved the Golden Monkey. Ithink this place has awesome beer but not awesome food."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"This place is your standard diner. The food is good but nothing special. The service is horrible. We waited over an hour for our food and then the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We have been here a few times and each time the service is below average. We had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork tenderloin and the chicken sandwich."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Better experience than last time. We had the Ribeye which was a nice size, the filet was a little too fatty and the meat was tough and the flavor was not great. The rice was good and the steak was good.  The mashed potatoes were very good as well. The only thing that disappointed was the side salad. It was very small and not very tasty. I'd rather have my salad with the ribeye.We were on a road trip"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"A group of friends and I went here for dinner. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the fries. The sandwich had a nice, thick cut of beef and a nice, crisp, crunchy, lettuce wrap. The fries were fresh and crispy. My boyfriend got the chicken salad sandwich with no dressing. He liked it and it had a good amount of meat. I got the chicken cheesesteak sandwich with fries and it was pretty good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I go to this place often. The food is good but it's always a little slow. The atmosphere is great. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great. I'm so excited to come back to this place. The food is amazing and the service is great. I love the food and the atmosphere! I will be coming back and recommending to friends as well. We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We've been eating at Han Dynasty for the last 10 years and it's always a pleasure to go. We always have the best food, service and sushi around. We love it. I'm so excited to have found a good Thai restaurant near my home. This is my first time here and I was looking forward to trying the curry and the curry chicken. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the chicken curry and it was not spicy at all."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Love, love Hemingway's Bar & Grill. The food is just as good as the rest of the restaurant. I've had the boneless wings, the fried chicken, the ribs, and the chicken sandwich. Everything is excellent. The staff is always friendly. This is a great place to have a drink or a snack with your date. I highly recommend this place!Great food, great service. I had the salmon with pork belly and it was delicious"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This may come to a few more people as the menu is a bit more limited, but the staff is so friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious!I love this place. The food is always great and the service is always great. I wish I could come back here every time I'm in New Orleans. I will most definitely be coming back here again.I've been here several times and have had great experiences.  The food is always good and the"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The place is OK and the staff is friendly.  I will say that the food was pretty good.  The burrito was alright.  The chicken was okay.  The tortilla soup was okay.  The shrimp tacos were okay.  I really liked the shrimp tacos.  I don't think I will be back.I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami. It was amazing! I can't say enough about the atmosphere.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is a small eclectic little place, with a very small bar. There is a large menu. We had the burrito, which was good but the flavor was not great. The rice was very tough and the beans were a little soggy. I had the shrimp tacos, which were a bit too spicy. I did not like the chicken and rice. I wish I could have had a different item but I did not like the salsa."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Philadelphia where's the love for this place?  It's a little far from my house but the staff is so friendly and the food is delicious.  The sandwiches are huge and I love that they have a little breakfast burrito option.  I wish I had to eat here once a week but it's always a good option.  I'd be more than happy to come back here.We live in Philly and have been to many NOLA restaurants and
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"As far as Philly Cheesesteaks go, Pat's really not that bad as many people I've come into contact with have claimed. I give it a 3.5 on a 5 point scale. It may not be the best out there but I would suggest if you haven't had it, are traveling to Philly, have the time to sightsee and are curious, just do it. It will be worth the experience at least once. I had the Mushroom Pepper Cheesesteak w/o Onions and with Wiz and I can say that I really don't regret it."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"What a lovely place! Aaron has juices that not only make you feel good, but build your health and vitality as well! The elderberry shot is packed full of fresh antioxidants and vitamin C from the elderberry, has germ-killing clove, ginger, and local honey in it, AND it  tastes delicious! We loved the fresh juices as well, packed full of vibrant nutrition and health benefits. Well done, Aaron, well done! You've managed to create health-giving vegetable and fruit drinks that taste amazing and help us keep our immune systems set on STUN!"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Applebees is my go to restaurant when i have no idea what I want. This location always has great staff and a good atmosphere. I always enjoy the two for $20. My kids are older now so they dont want to eat off of the kiddie menu but I also don't want to spend a ton of money on something they wont eat so they usually do this so they can share!

Their drinks are amazing..great bartender! Desserts of course are delicious. 

I love that the menu changes all the time for something new!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My husband and I go here often for a quick meal. The people are friendly, the food is good enough with lots of choices. It's exactly what a diner should offer. There is not one specific dish that I have as a favourite, but they have so many different things to offer - there is always something on the menu that you could eat and you'll most likely leave feeling satisfied and full. They also have a big selection of cakes but for some reason I have never tried them. Prices are cheap."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had a great meal here on Saturday night. We ate the margherita pizza, breaded fish with broccoli side salad, and cornbread gnocchi. The portions were reasonably generous. Not TGI Fridays generous, mind you, but big enough that an entree item will easily fill you up. (Of course, then you'd miss all the delicious smaller dishes.) Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgable of the menu. Their cocktails were another big highlight! I recommend the herbivore and also the old fashioned, complete with bourbon-soaked cherries. I would eat there again in a heartbeat."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My coworkers picked up lunch from there today and I thought I would give it a try. I ordered the poblano pepper lunch special since it is one of my favorite dishes. Really who could mess up a pepper and cheese? Cancun can; I think it may have killed my love for the dish. It had the consistency of rubber and had no flavor at all. The chips tasted like cardboard and the rice like sand, I am glad the beans were there to mix in the rice so I could eat something."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Love this place! They have a gorgeous selection of organic produce and a beautiful selection of mushrooms. I use quite a few of their cleaning supplies and products. They have a great cafe with vegan food that is on point. The apothecary is so much fun to look around for fun stuff to try and crazy awesome herbal remedies, if you can find a few minutes. The people who work there are knowledgeable and a joy to talk to. My only complaint is that there aren't more of these stores across the valley!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Waited 15mins at the bar. No acknowledgement no greeting. Bartenders waited on others that sat down after me. I waited 5 more minutes just to See was this actually happening then I left to be seated in dining room. Once seated service was great. My waitress was very attentive and friendly. Aniecia and David are the best servers they took great care of me.  If you want great service ask for themIt would have been 5 stars except for horrible Bar service. Acknowledging the guest comes first. A menu is an acknowledgement.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I planned a birthday brunch for 30 people in the private, side room. It was a wonderful experience! Janet was great to work with and responded quickly to every email I sent. The servers were fantastic that day, very responsive to requests and kept the food and drink flowing at a good pace. We enjoyed a delicious brunch from appetizers (home made doughnuts a must!) to the entrees, the food was tasty, warm when it needed to be and  fresh. Was a perfect way to celebrate a 50th birthday. Love it here."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"HOOOO WEEEEE is this some damn tasty pig they serve up!  I see why this place is so popular!   The cochon de lait po boy is swinetastic. Large, super tender pork topped with coleslaw and BBQ sauce.  I make them hold the coleslaw because i don't care for mayo and grab a side of the greens.  They are excellent with a healthy chunks o' pork nestled in the greeny, garlicy goodness adding mega flavor. Everyone here is nice, and its a great spot for lunch on the go."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I only tried one donut here. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the donuts are not very good. The donuts are okay, but the donut is definitely not worth it. It's just a bad donut.I really enjoy this place. The decor is a bit old-school and it's a bit loud. But I think the food is good and the staff is very friendly. 

I ordered the beef tender"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"A couple weeks ago, I had an unpleasant experience at a restaurant. When I arrived, the place was extremely packed. I sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly. The bartender told me that the food was good. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was a bit overpriced, and the service was lacking. I would definitely come back. We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,What a great place!!!  We will be back!!Very good food. Service is excellent. The owner is very friendly and helpful. He is the best customer service I have ever experienced. I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and it was great! I will definitely be back. I ordered a hamburger medium rare. It came out medium well and I was very happy with it.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,My wife and I were here for the weekend and decided to try a place for a date night. We had reservations but the place was packed and we had to wait a while. We were seated right away and the waitress was very attentive. We ordered the gyro and the chicken sandwich. We both ordered the chicken sandwich and it was amazing. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the rice was very flavorful. We also tried the baklava which was very flavorful.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Ahi ceviche was about 15% more than the regular ceviche. The fish tacos were a little too fatty for my liking. The chorizo was a little too thick. The lettuce was not fresh at all. The tamales were very good. They had a decent selection of beers and cocktails. The food was good and I think they had a good selection of drinks.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Ok im not sure why this place is so popular. I dont think they have the best service. I think they are trying to be a bit more fancy than the other place in town.The food was great. The server was a bit slow. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I got the fried oyster appetizer and it was so good. I wish I would have gotten the shrimp and grits. It was all good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I'm a big Cajun food snob and I'd never heard of a place that served a crawfish po boy. The crawfish was good but the flavor was not great. The seafood was okay. The shrimp was fresh and had some shrimp and seafood flavor. The breading was a little tough. Overall, I'd probably give it a 4. 5 star. We just went there with our group of 4 for brunch."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Doesn't say on the menu that it's anything special. I did not try it, but the staff is so friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious!I love this place. Food is amazing and the service is amazing. I will always be coming back. I've been coming here for years. I have to say it's the best chicken and waffles I've had in a long time. The chicken is tender and flavorful."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"My first impression was way too sweet and the taste was too sweet. My second impression was just ok. The food was good but not worth the price.I love this place. Food is amazing and the service is amazing. I will always be coming back.I've been coming here for years.  I have never had anything bad here.  The only issue is that I'm a vegan.  This place has a lot of vegan options, but I always feel"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"As a college student, I visited this restaurant frequently for their reasonable prices and GREAT portions. 

I still eat here now and have never experienced an upset stomach or food difficult to eat.  I love their hot and sour soup, mongolian beef, and fried rice.  The staff is very friendly and always seems very concerned if a table isn't happy with their meals.   I have eaten at other establishments and large national chain Chinese restaurants that are also nice, but I enjoy the more intimate setting of this local restaurant."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Not very good. My roommates and I went in tonight. The Chile rellenos my friend had smelled like a dirty diaper and was cold in the middle. He sent it back and was accommodated with another dish. His wife only had the flan and said it was fine but I'm fairly sure it was a premade, bought in from an outside source dessert. All the food is extremely salty. I drank 5 glasses of soda just to get through it. I'll give them 2 stars on the service alone, but I won't be back."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The square pizza is awesome. Period. It's amazing and delicious and I highly recommend it. The place is new and it shows. The servers are, as other reviewers have noted, young and borderline annoyed that they are working every time we're there, but I suspect that they're more annoyed that this place is still CASH ONLY. WHY??!

I really want them to stop slamming the beverages down so hard on the table and possibly smile. Even a fake smile will do and I'll ignore the fact that your boobs and ass are hanging out, lol."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We come here all the time. Perfect spot before a show at the Fox Theater or Powell Hall. We'll even go here before a show or sporting even downtown. 
Great wine list, great beer & cocktail list, and the food is awesome. I loved, loved, loved the Tuscan salad - it has chicken, awesome dressing and even a perfect amount of jalapeno to spice it up. I can't get enough of it. Service is spotty, but they're always super busy so I can understand. Highly recommend you get a reservation on OpenTable before going."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Have been several times. Love the Pom Mimosa's. Awesome Chicken Salad. Didn't care for the Hollandaise at all, but by the time the food arrived I didn't care :). GBF had Shrimp&Grits, it looked funky to me, but I don't like BBQ Shmp & Grits mixed. Can't remember what BBF had. You know, the Pom Mimosa's are really good, lol. Future visits will be in the ""We are up early Brunch Place's, but don't get Benedict's, Limit Pamela to 1 Mimosa before the food arrive's"" list."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Hidden GEM on the west side! This place has been around for years but they have added on an outside seating area and some new menu items. I had the WILD BEAST BURGER! Words can not describe this must have burger (Elk, Bison, boar and Wagyu. Served on a buttery brioche bun a meal for a king...the smoked wings are also amazing. Our bartender/server was super and very friendly. It was worth the drive from Noblesville and we will be back for the walleye fish fry every Friday!!! Amazing chef in the kitchen *****"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Over the top customer service. Super attentive and the food was high quality and super delicious. We ordered a salad, which for me it was a tad bitter, but the other LOVED it!. We ordered the Parma pizza, which was to die for!  Their fresh mozzarella, delish. Their parma prosciutto. OH EM GEE!  Pizza was topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. It was so full of flavor, so delicious. And what made our experience nicer was the amazing customer service."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Excellent! Fast service, delicious food, reasonable prices! We took a spring break trip to Clearwater Beach March 10. The kids wanted to try this place and it turned out to be a great choice. We were seated immediately even though they were busy. We didn't order any apps and went straight for the entrees. The four of us had scallops, a shrimp poboy, seafood tacos and one of the kids had a burger. It was all perfectly prepared and delivered on time. Taylor did a beautiful job with service. We will definitely be back."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"I don't usually go to Benihana's often but when I usually go it's often really good and the service is good. I was just there yesterday and I had outstanding service from my server, which I believe her name is Kylee. I really felt the urge to write this up because I think she deserves recognition. My family can be sometimes very needy but our server didn't break her friendly smile and she engaged her time with us. The food was also very good and our chef was hilarious. Will be coming back soon!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,We came here during the weekend and the food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The mac and cheese was awesome and the bacon was so fresh. The customer service was great as well. The only downside was that the bathroom was dirty and it was very loud and loud. I wish I could go back just for the food and drink.We were on a road trip and needed a
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This rest stop deserves its own review, as the food was fantastic. The cheese steak was awesome. The burger was the best I've had. The salad was tasty. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the server's attitude. He was rude and seemed to be annoyed that we were there. I won't be back. I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami. It was amazing! I can't say enough about this place."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"This is one of my favorite places in the area. I always get the cheese steak and the fries. The service is always great, and the food is consistently great. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer for your food. I usually get the chicken tenders and they are great. I always get the gyro and the fries. The chicken tenders are good,"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We went on a weeknight, and it was pretty quiet. I saw a lot of people eating and we sat down.  The place was packed and the place was clean.

The food: we had the Biscuit & Egg Biscuit, Tater tots, and the Chicken and Waffles. 

I think it's going to be a fun night for the people. 

The atmosphere is very nice and the service was good. 

We will be back.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This restaurant exceeded all expectations. We had the seafood gumbo, shrimp and grits, and the duck. The gumbo was the best I have ever had. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the grits were excellent. The grits were also very good. The food was very good. We will definitely come back to try more things on the menu. I love this place! They have a very great menu with lots of different items to choose from."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Great food, great service and a fun atmosphere. We will be back. Had a reservation for 4. 50pm on Sunday. Ordered a small pizza, a chicken salad, and a chicken salad. Both were excellent. The pizza was very large. My salad was excellent. The chicken salad was a bit too spicy. I did not feel the chicken was flavorful. My salad was also very good. The chicken salad was a little dry and lacked flavor."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I expected something special, after hearing so many good things about this restaurant. However, the food was just average. The burrito I got was very small, and the portions were very small. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I would come back to try other items on the menu. The service was great and the place was clean and well kept. The food was good but I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice breakfast place."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I ordered the pad thai. It was the best pad thai I've ever had. I ordered the chicken pad thai and it was delicious. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. The rice was very well seasoned and moist. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back. I'm always a fan of this place!  I'm not sure if it's a new owner or just a new staff, but I love the atmosphere and the food."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Just moved here 5 days ago and I've already been here 2 times. The food is deeeeelicious! The portions are huge too! If you're in the area, check this place out!! 
I got their beef noodle soup, duck box, and chirashi bowl. The duck was very tender and crisp, the beef noodle soup had so much flavor and they put A LOT of meat in there, and the chirashi bowl was so beautifully put togehr. Go support this small business, you won't regret it! 



I came again and wanted to share some pictures this time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great location on whyte ave, the food is east coast inspired, and the east coast twist on the food is delicious. The service is great, friendly staff food comes out hot and fresh . 

My favourite thing on the menu is the donair poutines, I'm not usually into donair but it's a completely different style with more flavours, I have to get it every time I go here. 

The atmosphere is great to have drinks and the music isn't too loud so you can still have conversations. Strongly recommend stopping in to Blowers and Grafton"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"First cheesesteak I've had with provolone and it was very good. There's a ton of meat on there so you have to work your way down to the borderline bland meat to get to the cheese. Once you get there it is worth it. Next time I'll probably ask for extra cheese.

The store itself looks like a mini convenience/deli/ice cream shop so much different than the other cheesesteak spots in the city. Also kind of hard to find.

The cheesesteak was big enough to split between two people and came out to a little over $10."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Came here with my family, I really liked that they accommodated us even though we called the concierge at 1p to make a reservation ans didn't even made that reservation, super upsetting! As for the food it was a hit and miss, the beef was so dry and disgusting. The other plates were okay. I liked their prawns since it had some cantaloupe and honeydew fruits in it, yum! As for the rest it was mediocre, pricing is a bit high. The quality of the food was was pretty low. Our server Linda was superb."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Just a tip for professionals in Wilmington: DO NOT try to get lunch here during your work day. I just waited 25 minutes before I finally got up to ask someone to take my order. I got a blank stare when I told the staff how long I was seated and waiting. I asked if I could just order take-out because I had to get back to the office. The response was an indifferent shrug and then after I asked again, I was told ""that will take a very long time too."" So I left."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Pretty awesome place ! Called ahead and they had tables. So we decided to check it out. Walked it to Mexican music and a nice atmosphere. The owner Jill was walking around checking on the customers and I could tell she was well loved by the regulars. The steaks were really great. She came and checked on our table. It's always great when the owner checks on you. She knows what customer service is all about and the waitress was also really good at her job.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I would only recommend to go Sunday nights when sushi is half price. Make sure to get there early because there can be a long wait. You have to order a drink (can be non alcoholic). Certain types of sushi are not half price so make sure to ask your server before ordering. Also you cannot take leftovers home so do not over order. I usually get the shrimp tempura roll which is delicious with the spicy mayo sauce. The quality is the best I've had in Indianapolis, but I believe it is normally overpriced."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,I meet some lady friends at this Olive Garden about once a year. It is never too crowded and service is always good. And you can't go wrong with the free breadsticks and soup or salad. I like that they have the healthy options and I enjoyed my lasagna meal that is only about 500 calories. We also didn't feel rushed and were able to sit around talking for about a half hour after we finished our meals. Plenty of parking. Much easier to park than the chain restuarants over by Wegmans and Cheesecake Factory.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Have really enjoyed trying out this new donut shop in Fishers. For the first 2 weeks, they gave out one free donut to every customer, so I have been able try multiple of their different types. My favorite so far is the cinnamon roll. It is great! My only drawback would be some of the more basic donuts can be a little airy, but this is not too bad of an issue, since that just means they are not as filling, so you can just eat more. We will definitely be back in the future."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,First time going there this weekend. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,The Cali club chicken sandwich was a huge disappointment. The chicken was dry and the sauce was just a little too sweet. The sides were okay. The salad was okay. The only other thing that was good about the meal was the service. There was a server who was very friendly and attentive. The food was just ok. I will not be coming back here.I've been here several times and have had great experiences.  The food is excellent and the prices are very

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but the food is not great.  I've been to many other Thai restaurants in the area, and it's not really worth the money.  I think it's just a bad day.

I've had my fair share of good food from here and they have always been a good value
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Why does it take 45 minutes to get an order? I'm not sure, but I'm not sure. I had to get up and order, but then I had to get up and go to my car and get my order. The drive thru is very slow. There's not much parking. There's a lot to go around, but I'm not sure why they're taking so long. It's not like they're trying to get customers. I will never order from"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Super famous brand in the Tampa area, the food is good, but the service is slow and the atmosphere is not very welcoming. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I go there is because of the good reviews.I've been going to this place for almost 3 years and it's always good. I've always had great service and great food. I like the cheesesteak sandwich, but I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't like"

I've been to many fried chicken places in the area, and this one is by far my favorite.  I always get the same thing-- the fried chicken.  It's not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but it's not bad either.  It's just a good fried chicken"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is a great Nashville brunch place! We were here for a bachelorette and the food is fun but a little off tradition. So definitely try something new! 

 The pool is also super fun for a Saturday so I suggest it for any bachelorette parties in the summer. Make reservations months in advance for the chairs!  They bring drinks out to you, the pool is tiny so they could definitely cool that better. The thing that would be awesome is if they did separate checks outside or at least be able to split it."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Yesterday we stpped by for a lunch. Being a former Jersey guy, I wanted to try this new place which is located near the University of Tampa.

It was an incredible Pizza made by Jersey guy who is a UT Grad. The sauce is fresh tangy and tasty, the cheese is fresh, and the dough is hand tossed,.

The final product is a  thin crust, hot tasty pizza that you fold just like in NJ. 
Best Pizza in a long time...reminds me of Bonvinni's in Livingston. 

Highly recommend that people go there and get a pie!

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"We just ordered an eggplant parm, pizza turnover, cheesesteak hoagie, fries, and chicken parm panini. The eggplant parm was not breaded and fried it had about 3 yes 3 slices on a large sandwich. The flavor was good but lacked eggplant. The cheesesteak hoagie (large) has about 8oz of meat and mostly stuffed with lettuce. The fries . The pizza turnover had very little cheese and barely any sauce. It tasted like it was frozen, the dough was dry and hard more like a cracker. Overall, disappointed.
UPDATE:
They responded promptly and offered to send a gift card."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Very disappointed. Lunch specials are only available for dine in so I paid $14 for takeout only to find that my chicken curry was made with tiny pieces of all dark meat and only a small amount of chicken was in the container. All of the curry pictures from the other location have white meat and I have never been served dark meat in a curry before. The curry flavor was good and there were a lot of vegetables, hence the two stars, but not worth the $14. Would try again if some changes are made."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"When on the west side of Indy and in the mood for Mexican food, Tacos A La Diabla fits the bill. Located in a small strip mall, you might miss it if you don't look for their bright sign that says ""TACOS"". This taco shop has a surprisingly large menu, ranging from taco salads to the classic Mexican staples, to seafood dishes, AND your meal includes complimentary chips and salsa (and automatic thumbs up for me). With quick service, good food, and low prices, you'll be happy you tried Tacos A La Diabla at least once."
Restaurants,1.5,OR,These people are as slow as a snail. I ordered a salad and fries (lol - I wanted to be healthy needed some grease) and the girl charged me for a side salad. I told her that she charged me for the side salad so the manager came over to give me my money back. It was $1.49. He wanted to just give me $1.49 instead of $1.49 plus tax...He did not understand that he needed to give me a tax back and made a snide comment that I had only paid 90 cents in tax.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"So coming from Los Angeles we've got a huge Hispanic population and I've had my fair share of bread and pastries. I saw the reviews and had time to kill so stopped by and picked up a few different breads.

First bite and I knew I'd had the best Mexican bread to date. Crazy, in Tennessee, the best Mexican bread. 

I should go back for more. I wish I knew the names of each bread but get the one that is a long triangle with a cream cheese and sugar coating.

The horn with cream is good too."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Don't bother with this place. The food is severely overpriced for what you get. Order the steak fajitas with jalapeños, food came after almost a 45 minute wait. Six slices of small steal prices, and was charges $2.50 for basically a half of jalapeño, which brought the grand total to my measly steak fajita to 17.49!! What a rip off!!! I'll never bring my family back to this place ever again! Between the service and food quality, there are many other better choices in the area.... Save yourself the time and effort and go somewhere else!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"These tacos were incredible! We had a bit of a wait to get seated at a table indoors on a Tuesday night - but killed time by going to one of the many bars in the area. I'd suggest putting you name down early if you want to experience their outdoor patio.

The tacos here are incredibly tasty! I ordered a puerco verde, carne asada, bistek, and AM taco. Each was packed with flavor and the meat was tender. We order enough to take home. Check this spot out if you are in the area in Tucson."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Their Mexican food buffet sent me here, and it was good. The food is good. The burrito is good. The salad is good. The tortillas are good. The guacamole is good.

The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,The food here is always good. The only reason I don't rate this place a 4 is because the service is very slow. The food is always hot and tasty. The only reason I don't give it a 4 is because the coffee is cold. This is my new favorite coffee spot.I ordered the chicken nuggets and they were very good. They are a little on the dry side but the chicken was still very tender and flavorful. The fries were a little salty for my

If I had to give it a 3 star I would. I will go back. If I lived in Tucson I would go here every night. I am not sure I will be back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The pizza here is very good. The crust is thin and crispy. The cheese is fresh and the toppings are crisp and the meat is crisp and the sauce is delicious. I would definitely go here again. It's a little pricey for what it is. I've been coming here for about a year now and I've been disappointed by the service and quality of the food.

I've been to many Italian restaurants and this one is a favorite.  This one is a little different than the other.  The interior is the same, but the interior is much more modern.  They have a modern art on the walls, as well as a nice bar with a good selection of wine"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I figured since management addressed my last review i figured i would give it another shot. 

Absolutely a circus run by poorly trained employees. I knew I was in trouble when the same person that prepared the table next to me for wrong made my sandwich. So after waiting 15 minutes, yeah you guessed it, it was wrong. 

Then it takes another 10 minutes to get a refund and they still couldn't get it right. My advise is close down for a couple of days and properly train your employees. 

Let me add the place was empty."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great diner in the neighborhood. Walked in and it was packed, was told a 15-20 minute wait for inside seating. 5 minutes later we're at a table, and we found out why. Fast, excellent and friendly service had our food out within 5 minutes of ordering. My wife got the veggie omelet with hash browns and they were good, and I had two eggs, cheese grits and bacon. I could have made a meal just on the cheese grits and bacon they were so good! Would recommend to anyone looking for a good, reliable and affordable breakfast."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"What can you say about this place other than good diner food? That's about it. They do diner food well. I mostly get breakfast and it's mostly pretty good. I prefer the french toast. It's good enough to keep me coming back at least twice a month. Service runs the gamut from downright charming to doesn't really want to be bothered, but I don't have too many complaints about the wait staff. 
You could do a lot worse in a diner. Ok, that's not exactly an endorsement. Tiffany's is a pretty good place to get a meal."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Noisy place with fairly slow service at lunchtime.  Took 1:45 to eat lunch on a Thursday.    Some of our food came out of kitchen cold.  One of us had the slider lunch special, which comes with two sliders......one of them was cold and one was hot.  Coffee had to be sent back cuz it was just luke warm.  Soup was good.  Fish sandwich was good.  Wedge salad had too much dressing.    Overall, the place was pretty good, but not good enough for the price range."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Honestly I have never been treated with such disrespect.  It was crowded to the point that their servers didn't know what was going on. The food was good don't get me wrong but when u can't keep my drink filed ur bartender is so disrespectful and u can't keep ur restaurant organized it over shadows the taste of the food.... If this place is ad popular as it looks and sounds then they should get organized to the point that they don't have customers turning around and walking out as soon as they walk in ......
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"All I can say is WOW!!! First time here and it wasn't a disappointment. Food is unbelievable and very tasty. Everything, from the way the restaurant looks to the way the food is prepared, is VERY unique.  This place has a set up that I have never seen before. They also have a dessert section right next door.  My son had a burger where the bread portion was a glazed donut , do I need to say more ?? Also our server was awesome. Wish I would have found this place a long time ago."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Your food is so over priced it's not even funny! I could understand if it was good too but it's mediocre and the price is beyond ridiculous! You should be ashamed of yourselves charging that for the crap you serve. Picked up a tray of nuggets and a Spivey chicken hoagie tray. $105 for that? Are you insane. Make better food and charge less. I guess you need to make up the difference for being closed on Sundays? I will never ever go to this joke of an establishment again. KFC, Churches and Popeyes are better anyway."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,1 year ago today my team and I went to bartaco for the first time and it stuck with us for a whole year. We came back from California on a mission...with high expectations! And it didn't disappoint! My top 3 favorite restaurants of all time easily!  Top 1 margarita I've ever had. Tacos are deliscious...the Guac is fresh...and the corn is dream worthy! Special shout out to their amazing staff...Especially our server Gray! She was fun and spicy and fast...put dinner over the edge! 5 outta 5 every time! Go here or forever be lacking!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food here is just OK. I went for lunch today with a coworker and had Pra Jee and the tom yum soup. Most tom yum I've had was sour and spicy and delicious. This was more like spicy broth without the sourness. Oh, and they charge extra to add shrimp. wtf? Don't bother asking for Squid. The Pra Jee was alright, but there was not enough fish in it for the price. My total for those two items (I drank water) was $14 and some change and $17 after tip. Completely overpriced if you ask me..."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Best food I've had in Tampa. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I'm from Florida.This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we found this gem! We ordered the crab cake appetizer and my husband had the pork chop entree. The crab cake entree was very delicious!
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I really like going to this place and the food is good. 

The only thing is that I am not a big fan of the sushi, and the sushi is very small. 

The only thing I like is that it's BYOB.It was good! I had a chicken salad with a side of greens.  The chicken salad was a little bland. The greens were great, but I wish there was more.  I'd definitely go back for lunch again"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,We came here with a group of friends after a concert.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.   The place was packed and we had a great time.  The food was good and the service was good.  The food was ok.  I ordered the chorizo tacos.  They were the most disappointing tacos I have ever had.  The chips were cold and the salsa was very salty.  The burrito was over cooked and the rice had no seasoning
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I was ingerested in trying this place, and we decided to try it for ourselves. We ordered the gnocchi, the Chicken parm and the chicken sandwiches. Everything was very good. We also had the bread pudding, which was very good. My boyfriend got the chicken parm and said it was pretty good. I had the lamb chops, which was very good. I also got the chicken breast, which was very good. The dessert was the chocolate cake, which was"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is my husband's favorite spot to eat. We usually get the chicken salad, the shrimp and grits, and the fries. The fries are crispy, seasoned, and great. The chicken salad is a little smaller than the grouper sandwich, but it's still good. The shrimp and grits are great as well. I also love the fact that they have a full bar. They have live music on Sundays and they have a good selection of beers. We also love the fact"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Made a curbside order... I asked for the receipt and they said it was my first time ordering and they would make it. The lady behind the counter said ""I'll be right with you"" and then proceeded to tell me to sit down. I placed my order and waited. The woman behind the counter said ""I'll be right with you"" and then proceeded to tell me to sit down and she would bring me my food. I asked if she could take my order and"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Sadly i never ate here. We had the crab cakes which were cold and dry. I ordered the duck breast which was very good. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The only thing that i didn't like was the sweet potato fries. They were ok. The food was good but the service was awful. I was the only one in the restaurant and it took a while to get our drinks. It took about 15 minutes for my husband to get our food.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Pascucci is a really ""antique"" restaurant. The menu is very extensive and offers a wide variety of dishes. We had the burrata, mussels, chicken and chicken parmesan, and the Brussels sprouts. Everything was amazing. The food was prepared with care and the staff was attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back.I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami. It was amazing! I can't say enough about the atmosphere."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I tried it on wed. We both had the shrimp and grits. Both were excellent. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The food was delicious. The shrimp and grits were a perfect size. I would come back to try their other items.We ordered the chicken nuggets and they were very good. The only thing that I didn't like was the breading. I think it was on the outside and a little greasy."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Okay, so I never thought to yelp and McDonald's but this one deserved a high five shout out!  This store was so clean and everyone (and I mean everyone!) was friendly and helpful!  I felt like I was in the Twilight zone or something. One of the workers saw a mom struggling with her two kids and help her carry her food to her table. Everybody had a smile on their face and a kind word to say. And let me just tell you, this was at noon!  That were slammed busy!!!  
Great job!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Food: 3.75 Out of 5
Nothing fancy no frills diner. For my breakfast of 2 eggs over easy, 2 sausage links, house potatoes, and 2 slices of rye toast it cost me about $9.75.

Service: 5 Out 5
The lady serving me was quick to welcome me and take my order.

Environment: 4 Out of 5
Standard diner layout, plenty of counter space and a handful of tables.

Overall: 4 Out of 5
When your body is craving that greasy spoon come over to this joint. This place still has that neighborhood feel with friendly folks serving you. Don't expect that fancy brunch place special!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Soup Kitchen is a perfect spot! I have never had a bad soup, and their cucumber lemonade is delicious! However, every once in a while one of the cooks destroys the grilled cheese. Sometimes, you get an amazing grilled cheese that is fluffy and other times you get a flat burnt piece of cardboard with no cheese. I don't understand how you can be so inconsistent with a grilled cheese and charge $6. 50 for it? Step your game up, and throw away the mistakes - make a new one which takes about 3 minutes."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Went here on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad he showed me this place!!! The concept of this place is absolutely mind blowing!!!! It's ruined going to other theatres and I now have to come here in order to enjoy the movie going experience. Went and saw The Force Awakens and ordered the chicken tenders meal and my girlfriend got a cheeseburger. It was delicious and the service was absolutely fantastic!!! The leather recliners are absolutely badass. My girlfriend is a cuddler so the fact they have loveseats for couples is great! Can't wait to return!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I love this place! It is definitely no frills but the food is great. I introduced a coworker to the place recently. We both ordered the carne asada taco plate. The beef in the tacos was really tender, flavorful and are served street style with soft corn tortillas. Served with rice and beans and a couple of salsas. I recommend enjoying the green salsa. My coworker was not familiar with the place and hadn't eaten here before. They really enjoyed the food. I've usually just had lunch here but will definitely be by sometime to try the breakfast."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I love visiting Metropolitan Bakery. They are close and convenient to those living near Penn's campus, and they have outdoor seating in the summer. Unfortunately, the homeless try to monopolize those seats, but that's a fact of life in any big city. They have a wide menu, and they even offer catering. The sandwiches are a bit pricey, but they're delicious! I usually order a panini or a wrap for lunch with some fair trade coffee. It always hits the spot on a lazy weekend. Be prepared for a long line on the weekends though."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went here with my family this morning and this food is INSANELY GOOD. I tried everyone's food and have to say they have the best onion rings I have potentially ever had. Additionally, my eggs Benedict may have also been the best I've ever had. The food is delicious and the wait staff are SO nice. Julie was our server and she was extremely kind, attentive, and overall lovely. Also, THE DOUGHNUTS ARE THE BOMB. Go now and forever thank yourself for this tummy explosion of goodness. Seriously, this place is fantastic. Oh! And adorably decorated :)"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great go-to for a quick take out lunch. It's in the Anchor building off Memorial and easy to find once you know where it is. It's inside the office building in the far corner. Not well signed though. They have a great and varied menu. The specials are always good too. Fast service from a well-oiled team. I like the salads since I'm low carbing, but the bowls are great too. The line may seem long if you come at the height of lunch, but it moves fast. There is also plenty of seating for dine in also."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Sorry, not a fan. This place was just OK. Being a customer who has frequented Mad Crab and Hot and Juicy Crawfish (in other cities), this place didn't stack up. I ordered 1lb of crab legs, garlic butter and the Garlic Shrimp n Noodles. The shrimp tasted good, but the noodles were a tad bland and dry. The seasoning bag for the crab legs was literally a bag of butter... uuummm, where's the rest of the seasoning profile. Their approach to the seasoning bag didn't really get into the crab legs too well, so...yea, it was just ok."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Wow just wow, this is a place you want to try if you are in the area! 

The food is amazing. The mussels and the mussels are great. The rice is soo good. The shrimp and grits are some of the best I've had. The people working there are very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend!Delicious food and service!  We came here for a quick lunch and were happy to find a great place to eat."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I am from California so this place is a must try.  The food is amazing and the staff is so friendly.  I will definitely be back!I have to say I was very disappointed. I ordered the salmon taco which was very bland. My boyfriend got the shrimp taco and said it was very good. I will probably just stick with the seafood tacos. I will definitely be back for the tacos.Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This was such an amazing experience. The food was amazing and the service was great. We ordered the gnocchi and the gnocchi with parmigiana. The gnocchi was so good and the gnocchi was so flavorful. My boyfriend got the gnocchi with parmigiana and it was so good. We also ordered the gnocchi with the traditional garlic sauce and it was delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and very attentive.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,A great lunch place! This is a great place to try out a new place for a date night. I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little tough to chew and it was very chewy. I think the chorizo was just a little too salty. I will be back.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The food was good. Service was slow and the food was cold. We had a reservation and the place was packed.  The place was packed and we had to wait a while for our food. The table next to us got their food before us. I had to ask for water for the second person. I was also the only one in the restaurant and it took a while to get our food.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"So I always wait before I leave, because the parking is a little tight, but I'm always here. The food is always good. The staff is always friendly. The atmosphere is nice. The only complaint is that the wait can get a little long. Otherwise it's a great place to hang out and have a beer and have a good meal.I love this place! I go there often for lunch and I love the atmosphere and the staff. I always get the shrimp dumplings"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,This place is exquisite!  We had the Ribeye and the Mac & Cheese.  Both were cooked perfectly and the sides were fabulous.   The Ribeye was so tender and juicy that it was like eating a deep dish in a bed of rice.  The Mac & Cheese was also so yummy and so tender!  We also had the crab cakes with a buttery cream sauce and my husband had the ribeye with ham and bacon.  Both were perfect and so filling.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Before my friends and I decided to dine here. I was very excited to see that the place is so close to our house, but it is a little bit more of a go-to place.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Teca Newtown Square is average, but the food is good. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food is good, but if you're a diner, this place is a little overpriced. I would come back for the food, but I would not recommend it to others. Also, I'm not sure if it's a bad place to go for breakfast or brunch, but it seems like the service is slow and a little lacking."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"***CASH ONLY***

M Kee is a great spot for ur typical Chinese meat assortment meals (roast pork, soy chicken, roast duck, cuttlefish, ...etc)

They serve everything in both egg noodles soup (or wonton soup) or as a rice dish.

They got some decent appetizers (dimsum apps)

We shared a combination egg noodle soup (if u ask, they'll mix any meat and wonton) dimsum, and fertilized egg congee (one of my favorite dishes, although it can be intimidating for first timers)

Very quick service.
I frequent philly a couple times a year and I definitely see this spot as becoming my go to spot in Chinatown."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Very nice servers and staff. The food was very greasy for non- fried items. Veggies, rice and fish left grease all over the plate. Bread cut the roof of my mouth because it wa so hard on the crust, asked for a different batch and it did the same thing. That could have just been an off bakery day. My BF liked the flavor of the swordfish and the food but agreed it was really oily. If you're good with that,  then the staff and ambience make it worth the visit. I'm just picky about the grease thing."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Terrible customer service. This is a new restaurant so we knew there would be ""growing pains""; however,  when I wrote a poor review the owner (who previously introduced himself to our table) told our table to ""get the fuck out or he would call the police"". We paid our bill but expressed our dissatisfaction with the entrees on our bill (showed up at the same time as the appetizer). I was told directly by our waitress ""the entrees will be removed"" and they weren't. 

Entrees were served at the same time as dinner.  
Dinner ended up cold."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I'm surprised to hear about slow service here.
We must have been lucky but have been there 5 or 6 times.

The first time I went there (lunch) I paid attention to the time.
We had our food 15 minutes (Sushi and some Pho) and paid and out the door in 45 minutes.

Have been a couple of times at night when it was very busy and took longer than that but not annoyingly long.  I've had Sushi every time and the prep looked good.  Maybe they have a new guy?

Anyway, the variety on the menu is the main selling point."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went in to buy a dozen of their dinner rolls and a house salad to go. Andrew, who took my order, first typed my phone number wrong even if I told him twice to correct it. Also after waiting for more than 20 minutes to get my order, he called me by a wrong name, and then when I  checked my order,  we found out that he only picked up half a dozen instead of the whole dozen. I really like this restaurant, but the past two visits here have been a disappointment with their customer service."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Was hesitant to try the spot because of the failed restaurant before it in the same location. Went in for a Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised. The brunch options blew me away. This is now become a special occasion spot for our family because the menu is a bit pricy which I assume has to do with using local ingredients to create the ""farm to table"" trend. The food is always nicely prepared. They do simple dishes well and then add a modern twist and then also some not normal, something even for the foodie in the group."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"After seeing this place on Man vs Food, I knew I had to get over here.

The place is very cool and laid back, as well as the patrons who are incredibly nice and vocal about what to try. Beer selection was outstanding.

The guys tried the monte cristo dog for an appetizer, damn tasty and different.

I had the steak slinger special (or something like that) and it was off the charts. Oak-wood smoked pork was just OK, too bad, I thought that was going to be amazing.

Group of 8 and service was pretty good keeping up with our bar needs"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"A little disappointed with this place. I used to go all the time when this spot was located off skyline. It was our go to for sushi in town. We decided to give the new location a try for the first time. The staff was very friendly and quick. The appetizers and nigiri were very good but the rolls were sub par. We had the lulu, tundra and hiroba rolls. None of them tasted great. Mushy even. With all the new sushi spots that have opened in the last 5 years or so, we likely won't be coming back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We had the most wonderful dining experience in Gianna.

The service was excellent. The bartenders seemed to be very attentive to our needs. 

Might I recommend the Sangria for the summer red wine drinkers. It was really tasty. 

We sampled a few specialty drinks but that Sangria had us buzzin!

The oyster dish was also really good. We were restaurant hopping so we did not eat very much. 

The bartender did surprise us with a chocolate shot. It was very good too. 

All in all, I love the area Gianna was built in. It is a great addition to the city."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I live right down the street from the restaurant and I've never had a bad experience here. The atmosphere is great and the staff is always friendly and the food is delicious. I've been to many other Thai restaurants in the area, and I'm not one to judge. The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating. I've also had the chicken pad thai and the Thai tea. I always get the same thing, the pad thai, and it's perfect."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This place is awesome! I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken but I love the variety of toppings. The mac and cheese is a must try and the sweet potato fries are amazing! The only thing I wish is that they had a coffee shop. This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we found this gem! We ordered the crab cake appetizer and my husband had the pork chop entree. The crab cake entree was very good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My first trip here turned into an unpleasant experience. We were seated at the bar and were immediately asked to move.  The bartender, who took our order, was not attentive and seemed to be annoyed that we were in the middle of a conversation.  I had to ask for water and silverware before she could take the order.  

I ordered a burger and fries. I was served a burger and fries with my burger.  I asked for a side of chili sauce and when"

Restaurants,3.0,CG,We visited the Red Hen last night and the food was good.  The waitress was very nice.  The food was good but not worth the price.

The waitress was very rude and seemed like she was doing her best to make sure we were taken care of.  I would not recommend this place to
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Went for lunch today. Been here a couple times and never had a bad meal. I ordered the chicken salad and it was delicious. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. I would definitely go back. Just wish they had a beer menu. This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food is always good and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken hash. It's always delicious."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The food was very good. We had the crab cakes which were very good, the potato salad and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was very fresh and tasty.

We had the grilled salmon with pork belly and it was delicious!  The prices are very reasonable for what you"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We chose Kite and Key because of the wide variety of choices on the menu. I was not disappointed. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers and shared the fried green tomatoes. The fried green tomatoes were amazing. I would order them again. The fried green tomatoes were also amazing. They were cooked perfectly. I did not have a problem with the batter but they were still very crispy. The baked potato was also very good. The baked potato was a little salty for me but it"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"The commercials and ads are all over the place and you can't even make a reservation.  The food is not very good.  There is nothing special about the food.  The only thing that is good is the beer selection.  There are many different beer options.  The only thing that is good is the beer selection.  

I would say this place is a good place for a quick beer drink.  The food is good and the drinks are good.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Visited there for lunch with my wife. Ordered the mussels that were of a repugnant variety but ok in how executed. The service was poor, server very inattentive even after few people left from lunch hour. My cheeseburger was overpriced and of medium quality. My wife has a roasted beet salad, she said she liked it. Why the two stars, prices too high, service fair at best and a menu written to justify high prices. Lastly limited selections. More like a child trying to prove he is the smartest in the room just a little too hard. Skip this stop."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Thee food is not good and the wine is nOt great either. We paid 90$ for two adults and a toddler. It felt like a waste of money. My husband had the burger and it was very disappointing. I took the duck taco. The tortilla was really bad and came cold. We ordered a side dish of mac and cheese for our daughter, and it looked like it came out of packed meal from the microwave. We did not eat it because it tasted really bad. The ambiance is nice but the quality of the food do not match it."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Great experience. This is the best experience I have had at a Saladworks. Upon entry, I perused the soups for food allergies. I was immediately greeted and the employee went straight to the book for ingredients so I could avoid any food allergens. I was able to find a soup with was free of of gluten, dairy, soy, et al. I then ordered a salad and had multiple options that were safe for me to eat. Instead of a roll, I was able to choose Cape Cod Chips. Great experience! I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had been hearing the ad for this restaurant on lighting 100 for a while, and decided to try it out when I had family in town. They liked this place so much, we visited 3 times while they were here for the week.

The food is fresh and delicious. The menu has a great selection. The smoothies are the best I've had anywhere and that goes for the bagels as well. The staff is patient and very helpful when you are ordering.

I love to support local businesses and I am looking forward to becoming a regular at this delicious cafe."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Have been going to MexiCali ever since it was a store, not a food truck. Overall, great value and great quality burritos. 

My go-to is the Pollo Y Papas burrito which is a great chicken/sweet potato combo burrito. You can choose what level of spiciness you want in the sauce which is nice. I think the sweet potato option is great - you don't often come across places that put sweet potato in their burritos, but it's absolutely delicious. They also have a variety of vegetarian options . 

I also like that they have jarritos - always down for that!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Eaten here twice with the fam and I have to say that while the service was average the food was delicious.  

I know this may seem weird but do yourself a favor and try their salad; you get one with an entrée or order one on the side.  They use fresh greens (not iceberg) and have two homemade dressings; mango chili vinaigrette and chipotle ranch.  They are both pretty amazing and I'm torn over which one is better.

Things we've tried include the tortilla soup, tacos, enchiladas, mole and chili relleno and we have yet to be disappointed."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've eaten here twice. The first time the food was mediocre and the staff was weird. Same thing the second time but with the special bonus of styrofoam plates and plastic utensils. I broke my fork mushing a baked potato and ended up eating the entire meal with it. The shifty-demeanored waiter, who  was prone to wandering away from out table while we were talking to him, had some vague explanation for the disposables and took no notice of my fork stub. It shouldn't be legal to charge $12 for an entree not served with real dishes and flatware."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Ripplewood is great.  Happy hour is well priced with perfect bar food - the fries with shredded brisket (or something like that) or so good but very filling and very addictive. The brussel sprouts are also excellent. And they make a mean Old-Fashioned.  The outdoor garden seating area in the back is really nice in good weather. There's also an upstairs seating area so the place is larger than you'd expect from the street.  Parking can be tough in the area now that the Septa lot at Ardmore station is closed. Definitely make a res on weekends.
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Late Night Delivery...

Shared a pie with the bartender at The Raven Lounge. Believe it was the BBQ Chicken.

It was decent I suppose. I was stuffed after 3 slices (which is probably equivalent to 3/4 of a ""regular"" large pizza. I'm a big boy what can I say.

Didn't really taste the BBQ Chicken, and there really wasn't that much chicken, but it did what it had to do... which was eliminate the hunger pains.

Would I order the pizza before I drank my 3 pints of Guinness? Probably not... would I post-alcohol infusion? Hmmm... if I was feeling lazy, sure why not."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I'm giving this a 5 star because the food was good but it was also a little overpriced. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was pretty good and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was good but not great. We also ordered the chicken enchiladas which were pretty good.

I would definitely come back here again for a great fried chicken.I was there for brunch and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!"

I can tell you I will never drop a dime at this place.  After 3 bad experiences in one month, we were given 2 free hot fudge sundae.  They forgot the fudge. Lol   Tried again last night to eat, they forgot our fries so my husband went back for them. They offer him free coupons. No, just the fries please. Unreal. No management at all.  Won't be back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I ordered steamed baos. The vegetable one is not good at all. The beef is not all that great but better than the vegetable one. No flavor and I received no special sauce. The inside of the steamed baos is flavorless and stuffed with a couple of peas and cabbages. Trust me when I say, once you have had steamed buns from Mega Mart in Atlanta (so sad we don't have one here) then you know these cannot complete. I'm sure the other menu items are good but if you name your restaurant ""Steamboys"" please have the bomb ass steam buns."

I haven't had a steak sandwich like that in a long time, it had an abundance of meat that melted in your mouth and my friend ordered a sausage parmesan & said it tasted delicious and you could tell it was high quality sausage. Delivered in record time, both items were hot, the bread was still crisp and cheese was ooey gooey good. You can't go wrong and we'll be ordering again real soon*****"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Cask used to be great and unfortunately it's now one of the worst restaurants in Tampa. Their margaritas look like lemonade, no salt, no sugar, no lime. If you order a medium burger, it comes out extra rare. When you ask to order the grouper since you can't fathom eating the rare burger, they bring out a fish so salty you have to take a sip of water with each bite. After all of this, all the manager has to say is I'm sorry here's $8 off. If you'd like to keep your customers around I suggest improving your customer service."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Monell's by far has been the best dining experience that I have had here in Nashville.  Family style all you can eat of delicious southern cooking.  The menu rotates daily with fried chicken as the anchor.  I had the chicken and dumplings on Monday and also came for the brunch.  First time eating chicken and dumplings, the chicken was tender and amazing.  The fried chicken was everything that fried chicken should be, crunchy and juicy.  Brunch had eggs, pancakes, ham, bacon, sausage, fried chicken, etc.  You will leave here full to the brim, guaranteed."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love you Texas Roadhouse. I want to be buried with a hot roll with cinnamon butter slathered on it. Their rolls are hot & yummy, almost like you're eating dessert. I love getting my steaks (medium rare) smothered with extra onions & a side of loaded mashed potatoes & a cup of their chili. So absofreakinglutely-delicious. A great place to come eat before you go to try your luck @ Parx or a great place to celebrate (or console yourself) after you try your hand with lady luck. I wish I could eat here everyday. It's delicious & it's cheap!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"One of my to go quick neighborhood delivery. I usually get delivery from them and they typically would deliver my food about 15-30 mins earlier than schedule. 

My go to food from them is the garlic knots, spaghetti and meatballs, and their chicken salad. From time to time I also like their Hawaiian and pizzazz pizza. I've also tried their cheesesteaks.

I've haven't been disappointed by them yet. Taste have been pretty consistent and I think their price is fairly reasonable for their portions as well. 

I've been ordering from them for years so I doubt that I'd stop any time soon."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I went to Vin De Set last night with my boyfriend, and the experience was awful. Once we were seated it took 10 minutes for the waiter to approach us. When he did he talked only to me. He asked about drinks and left. We didn't see him for another 10 minutes when he asked me what I wanted as an appetizer. He took my order, again ignoring my boyfriend, and he left. We never saw him again. My boyfriend felt dehumanized by our waiter's treatment of him. We never got any food we ordered either. Needless to say, we left."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This is a great body shop, it was recommended by my go-to repair guy and I have had great work done by them on more than a few times. First of all, their strength is that they are a very practical and pragmatic shop, they do what they need to do and don't oversell you, in fact, they often come up with a best case alternative. There is a touch of south side good old boys here, but everyone treats you not only in a helpful and respectful way, but they also go the extra mile to make the job right."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Low class place, very unprofessional. We had the seafood combo which included shrimp and crab, the shrimp and crawfish gumbo, and the gumbo. The gumbo was not great, it was just a little bland. The shrimp and crab were also very undercooked. I ordered the shrimp and crawfish gumbo with a side of corn tortillas. The shrimp and crawfish gumbo was good, but the corn tortillas were not fresh. The shrimp and crab were very dry."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I tried Oakley's after I saw a movie at the airport. The food was good. The drinks were good, but the food was not great. I had the seafood gumbo and it was good, but nothing special. I had the shrimp and grits and it was good but nothing to write home about. My friend had the crab cake and she liked it but she liked it a lot more."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,WOW! This place is the best! The food is amazing and the drinks are just amazing! If you're looking for a great place to eat and get drinks you're in the right place!The food was great. The server was a bit slow. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great! I got the fried oysters and the shrimp was a little salty. I liked my oysters better. I think it was just too salty for me. I got the sweet potato fries
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"First time there and ever since it's been a bit of a wait for a table.  The food is delicious and the staff is friendly and attentive.  This place is definitely going to be a regular stop.  I'm a fan.This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food is excellent, the service is fantastic and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I love the decor and the decor is very classy. The restaurant is clean and inviting. I love the service and the food is amazing"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Great service and eclectic menu. We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent. 

The food is delicious. The eggplant parm was tasty. The sausage and cheese with the mushrooms and the eggplant parm was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend.Great food, great service. 
The atmosphere is very nice and the service was excellent. 
The burger was very good, but I wish there was more on the menu. 
The coffee was very good. "
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Our group of 6 had a great time. We ordered two appetizers, a variety of appetizers, two entrees, and a dessert. The appetizers were delicious, and the entrees were well prepared. The server was attentive, knowledgeable, and very friendly. We had a great time. Highly recommended!One of the best Indian food in the area. I've had the traditional naan and the chicken korma. The korma is a perfect combination of spices and naan."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I visited for the first time last night with my fiancé. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. The restaurant is very busy. The restaurant is very clean. The food was delicious. The cocktails were excellent. The staff was very friendly. My fiancé enjoyed his oysters. We will definitely come back to try the other menu items.Delicious food and service! I will definitely be back. The pork belly was my favorite. The shrimp and grits were soooo good!I had the
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I made an order from here on the weekend and it was cold. When I got home, the food was cold. The chicken wings were good but the flavor was not great. The rice was cold and the chicken was bland.I came here for lunch with my family. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly. The salmon was very tender and flavorful. The pork belly was cooked to perfection."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,This was my second time here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We were looking forward to eating here and it was not worth the wait. I've been here several times and have had great experiences. The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My daughter and I took a last minute trip to New Orleans from Pensacola, Florida. Our guide was Justin and he did a fantastic job. Very personable and funny but lining at all the reviews, it seems like you only hire very personable people. 
We've been to New Orleans many times and knew some of the history he taught us but never knew a lot of the details we learned. The only suggestion I could make to make improvements would be to be able to gain access to the Lalaurie Mansion for an in-depth tour. I'd book that in a heart beat!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had the Duck & Black Eyed Pea gumbo which is the only thing I ordered. The gumbo was really tasty and I loved the flavor that the peas added. The pieces of Duck seemed all most to small to taste which kinda annoying because I love Duck but again it's really good. The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was great, I sat at the bar which I recommend if you have to eat & Run. I did see a lot of people heading up stairs, I didn't go up there but I imagine they have a indoor/outdoor seating."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Made reservations for outside and wanted to sit right by the water. When we arrived, we were taken straight to our table at 7 pm, as expected.  The service was very good but the food was even better. We had the Rainbow Roll and a Volcano Roll and both were full of flavor and delicious. I don't know if the view was better or the food. 

I highly recommend Jackson's for dinner and will definitely make this a normal stop for my wife and I. This is one of those places that you wish you'd known about a long time ago."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Hot Wok is legit. Their menu and employees are authentically Chinese and it's refreshing to see some familiar dishes along with the stereotypical sweet n sour chicken. Their prices are ridiculously cheap too- we got takeout for a girls night and the bill was less than $25 for 5 peoples worth of food! Their parking situation isn't the most convenient and I honestly would have passed them by if I hadn't gotten recommendation from a friend but this place is a hole-in-the-wall gem! Give it a try, there's not many places where you'll find real whole veggie bits in your fried rice."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Don't be misled by the 3 stars! If you've never been here before try it before believing low rated reviews. We came from out of town to visit family and she Recommended The Horse. We started with the fried pickles and they were so good. They are fresh tempura breaded style. We also had the garlic Parmesan 
wings and they were THE BEST WINGS EVER! I had a juicy well done Sellersville burger that was hand patted and BIG! We also had a few salads that were good size and tasty. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Outside area really nice too."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Love Las Cazuelas! Everything I have had here is delicious. I love their guacamole, and my favorite entree is the seafood enchiladas (""de cangrejo""). I also love that they are BYOB - their margarita mix is usually pretty good, not too sweet or watery. Great complimentary chips and salsa as well. It's pretty small inside, so probably not the best for children - it's rather quiet and intimate. I am always able to find parking on Girard, or right behind the building. Just received a $25 gift card via Restaurant.com to use there as well, so I can't wait to go back!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"By far, my favorite spot to go to by boat.  Tucked away in Pass a Grille, it's never too busy and their grouper sandwich hits the spot.  The margaritas are awesome, no powdery mix in this place- very fresh and tasty.  I always sit at the outside bar so I have no idea how table service is but judging on how the waiters hustle it seems to be pretty good.
I think I like this place really because it's on  the water and it reminds me of being in  the keys which is always a win for me."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The Good: They have a good selection of food on the menu and serve breakfast all day. The food is good, not great, but good. Our server was attentive and pleasant. In addition, we love browsing in their store for interesting gifts. The Bad: Nothing stands out as bad here on this visit. But I do wish they had better crowd control in the area where you check in. It blocks the entry into and out of dining room sometimes. Overall, this is a nice place to go for casual dining with family and friends. I give it a solid 4 stars."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The food was great. Had quesadillas and guacamole and it was all super yummy. The margarita was INCREDIBLE! I read some complaints about too much ice (no such thing, imo) but with a marg this pure you want that ice. Personal tip: get one of those crazy good kiwi popsicles and dip in in your marg--you need this in your life. For reals. The employees were an absolute pleasure. People like this are a rarity, and were certainly greatly appreciated by my group. You get what you pay for, and I found my money well spent here."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I'm not from the area, but I've been in Nashville a few times and I'm pretty sure I've had the best food in town. The chicken sandwiches are pretty good, and the fries are awesome. It's a little pricey for what you get, but it's definitely worth it. They also have a good beer selection, which is great for a quick bite. I'd definitely recommend this place.Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Service mediocre, beer ok, food not so good. 

We left happy, but not full.I had the burrito and a friend had the chicken burrito. The burrito was pretty good. The chicken was good, but nothing special. My friend had the chicken burrito and said it was pretty good. I did get a side of the rice with the rice. I will say that the rice was pretty good. But the chicken was way too salty. I think I would have liked the"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is a good place for an intimate dinner, a casual dinner or for a quiet dinner. The atmosphere is great. The food is delicious and the service is great. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for two. If you are hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer for your food. I would recommend coming here on a weeknight if you are staying at the Hyatt. I used to love this place. I always get the shrimp dumplings."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I have been here several times and the food is consistently good.  However, the service has been a little slow.  I am not sure how the manager has been working in the past.  I have heard that the manager is extremely lazy.  This is not the first time I have seen him working with a group of people.  However, it is the last time I will be here.  I have to give it to the manager because he needs to get a better attitude and his lack of customer"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Louis' is really a simple, simple, and very comfortable place to eat. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable. The food is always delicious. The portions are very generous. The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this place.I came here for lunch with my family. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly. The salmon was very tender and flavorful. The pork belly was cooked to perfection."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Food was decent. (meaning it didn't take a long time to get our food) but the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our food and then the server never came to check on us. The food came out in a timely manner and it was hot and fresh. If you have a party of 2 or more, the servers will tell you to wait on them. We had to ask for water and the server seemed to be overwhelmed by the volume of people at our table."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Our service was awful. We asked for the server to come back after we had already ordered and he came back before we had to ask for him. The server was not attentive at all and we had to ask her to get us water. The food was ok and the food was not bad. We did not order dessert but the dessert menu looked good. The only thing I would like to add is that the service was not bad. We were on a road trip and needed a quick bite to eat.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This store has a great atmosphere. The food is good but it's also a small store and we sat at the bar. The food is good but the service is not great. The bartender was very rude and not very attentive.I came here for lunch with my family. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly and it was delicious. I will definitely come back here again.This is the second time
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is a nice place to go and enjoy a drink or two. There is a nice selection of beer and wine. The staff is friendly and attentive.I have to say I was very disappointed.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Does this place always make reservations wait more than 30 minutes past their reservation time?

Waited 40 minutes to get seated with an 8:30 reservation. The staff was very apologetic after the fact but when we asked how much longer they seemed pretty nonchalant about it. We got an apology cheese and prosciutto platter. Sangria wasn't bad. Hangar steak was amazing and the rest of the food was pretty good. I felt the marinara on the meatballs lacked character. And they ran out of the jamon and queso so they used pigs head... I'm am adventurous eater but that was a pretty bold substitute?"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The service was so awful here. It took at least 30 minutes for us to be seated at our ""reserved"" table, so we went to the bar for drinks. Bartender was extremely rude when she realized we weren't going to stay at the bar all night or order drinks right away. When we got to our table, our waiter seemed a little clueless about food selection and was slow. Food was ok, not memorable and definitely not worth the price. The side of ""greens"" are literally hot steamed pieces of romaine lettuce, AKA not worth ordering. There are better restaurants in the Gulch."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Love this place! We were heading back from LA to SF and stopped in Santa Barbara. What a beautiful view from the restaurant and amazing service. Our waiter was so friendly, he had a lot of time to answer questions and recommend things to us. Go during happy hour as drinks and pizza are so worth it. We had the meatballs as a starter, two pizzas (salami and fennel sausage. We preferred the salami one), half chicken that was roasted and a pasta (Bolognese). The food was so tasty, we finished everything and had no leftovers. We Will definitely be back to Convivo."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Last night, we wandered down to Positano Coast for the first of Old City's Thursday night happy hour promotion. I've never been here and was very pleasantly suprised to find a very adult crowd (30s-40s), a wonderfully breezy open-air vibe, and great bar service. We enjoyed some of the $3 wine (nothing special, but OK) and suprisingly good cocktail special ""The Bomber"", which was a mix of vodka, apples, and St. Germain, at $4. Food standouts were the deep-fried poached egg with roasted asparagus and the zuchinni flatbread at $4 each. Couldn't help but thinking what a great date spot this would be."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"While not as famous as Cafe Du Monde - the beignets are equally as good.  If not side by side, I'd be hard pressed to difference from either store except that Du Monde gives you 2 pounds of extra powdered sugar while Cafe Beignet only gives you 1 extra pound.

While both Beignet & Du Monde offer outdoor seating (much easier to get here)...Cafe Beignet also has a house band (Steamboat Willie & His New Orelans Jazz Band) was playing and made the overall experience that much better.  Warm beignets a hot beverage as we escaped from the craziness of Bourbon Street."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"After a long day of seeing the city we were looking for somewhere to have a good meal to celebrate my Son's 21st birthday. The staff could not have been more gracious and the food was excellent. While they treated him for his birthday with desert and a candle on top they did not embarrass him by singing! The food was excellent, the staff attentive and it was the perfect place to end a busy day. The environment and meal was the best we have experienced in the city. Thanks Red Owl staff for being the cherry on the top of our celebration!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love me southern good food.... so i had to try while staying in Brandon.... really good... the collard greens were great, i prefer with ham or bacon in them but they still hit the spot. .. macNchz was great, corn muffin was tastey, potato salad was good (mama warners is hard to beat so i have high standards).... now to the ribs... fell off the bone, tad watery but all in all good... the bbq sauce was very good!!! Im stopping back fosho!!!!! Cant wait to try the banana pudding and i will be storing up on the greens while moving here!!!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Whiskey Kitchen has some really great food. But first let me point out that they do not take reservations. I hate this. I don't know if restaurants use this to get buzz or what, but they really should because this keeps me from going there more often.

Besides that the food is outstanding. I love the Hot Chicken. The meat is super tender and moist and the coating crisp and hot. Plus, the mac and cheese is amazing. Super creamy and flavorful and the pasta is cooked just right. 

The New Fashioned is a delicious drink. I love the blend of spices and fruit."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"INCREDIBLE! Extensive menu with all sorts of choices from meat to vegan. I had the Market Hash (two eggs any style atop a hash of fresh, seasoned potatoes, house-roasted Crimini mushrooms, zucchini, onions and red peppers with spinach, melted mozzarella and herbed goat cheese, included a small bowl of fresh fruit and excellent multi-grain toast with jam). Shared a carrot pancake with REAL maple syrup (an upgrade but so worth it) (and most restaurants don't even offer it). Fresh squeezed OJ. Even decent coffee and I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Waitress was charming, informative, attentive, enthusiastic--and honest."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"if i could give this place a zero star, i would. The food is good. The drinks are decent, but the food is not worth the money. The service is okay. The food is not worth the money. I would definitely go back. I love the place, but the service is not worth the money. I've been here twice now and both times the service is great. I like that they have a separate section for check in."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I was excited to try this place because the food is good but I didn't think it would be as good as the other places I've been to. My husband and I were seated right away and we were served quickly. The food was ok and our server was very nice. We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were all great. The only thing that I didn't like was the bread pudding. I think it was just too sweet and a little salty for my taste.
Restaurants,2.5,CG,This location would have gotten a 4 star rating if it wasn't for the slow service.  The owner was not very attentive.  There were only 3 tables occupied when we were seated.  The table next to us had a draft beer and the server brought it to the table.  We were told it was a beer and it would be $3.50.  We asked for a drink refill and when we got there it was empty.  We asked for a new drink and it was never brought to the

Restaurants,3.5,CG,First timer and I loved this place. We went for dinner on a Sunday around 8:30 pm. The place was packed and the place was clean. The food was good. The server was nice and attentive. I ordered the chorizo tacos. They were the best I have had in a while. I also ordered a taco salad. I was happy to see they had all the usual things on the menu.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"When it comes to flavor, it's the best. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to get your food to go, you can't go wrong with the seafood platter. It's a large portion for about $20. 

I also love the fact that they have a huge selection of beer and cocktails. They also have a great wine list. I would recommend trying the beer list if you're in the area.This place is great!  I had the lobster mac"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"*YUMMMMMY* A friend recommended this place and I was very pleased.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Just moved to the area and have been craving a burger for a while now. I was pretty excited to try this place out. The fries were crispy, and the bun was very soft. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and texture of the burger. I also noticed the fries were perfectly crispy. The bun was also very soft and fluffy. The fries were also very tasty. I will definitely be back.Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch, but"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Fantastic breakfast spot with even better service. They had me at self service coffee station complete with to go cups. Atmosphere is chill and inviting. Decor is clean and refreshing. The menu has Italian breakfast dishes and reminded me of Italy. I had a frittata and chose to build my own. It was served fresh in an adorable little skillet.  Had the vegetables for my side. At first cauliflower, kale, and sweet potato seemed like an odd combination but was delicious. my friend had the carne pizza and said it was one of the best pizzas she's ever had. Will definitely go back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Today is my third time to Trips. First time during lunch hour. The menu has a lot to choose from. The table had interesting nostalgic travel brochure made into the table top. Check out my photos. 

I ordered Red's Shrimp and Grits. It was moderately priced. I call it Brunch In A Bowl because it had blackened shrimp, cheddar cheese, scallions, BACON and an egg (anyway you choose). I had the egg over easy. It was delicious! I was scrapping the bowl to get every last bite. 

Service was very good and server was friendly and accommodating. This place hits all my check points!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Had a wonderful dinner here with a group of women for a friend's bachlorette weekend. We split Fried Green Tomatoes and Fried Green Beans for the table, which were recommended by our server and were great. I had the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was deliciously battered and cooked to perfection: not too dry, and not greasy.

During our meal The Sweethearts of the Rodeo performed and congratulated our friend, and in celebration of our friend's marriage, the waiter ""showered our table in desserts"" and we enjoyed slices of Peach Cobbler, Pecan Pie and Cheesecake - all delicious!

Friendly staff, good food, and lots of Southern Hospitality!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I've been to multiple Iron Hill locations but this one is my favorite - highly recommend sitting on the outside deck during the summer because it has a great view of the river! The food and beer are always good and consistent across locations. I'm not a fan of IPAs so I appreciate that they have enough non-IPA options to have a full flight. The regular lager is my favorite but it's always fun to try a few things! Service is always good also. My only complaint is that this location isn't open later on the weekends, would love to hang out until midnight!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Take out during Covid (End of Nov 2020) with quite a few people dining in at 8:30pm, all employees wore masks, a responsible outfit to the pandemic. Fried chicken tastey, perfect amount of breading served on top of white bread to soak up the oil and made the bread tastey too! Mac n Cheese a bit too soft, not al dente and definitely not steakhouse mac n cheese quality but makes a nice southern fast food pairing. Coleslaw pure cabbage, creamy and delicious, not as sweet tasting and refreshing as KFC best coleslaw. Banana bread pudding is a cheap indulgence."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"O....M....G!!!!!!! I think my husband just had an affair with his sandwich lol he got the chicken crusted with nacho chips and I don't think I have ever seen him happier with food. My daughter got it as well and she was actually upset that she can't eat a full half, she is too full. I got the turkey wrap and I definitely have no complaints. Where has this place been all our lives!??!!??! We will not only be a commonly returning customer but we WILL be spreading the word to all our friends and co workers. Can I get a frequent flyer card?????"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I don't get what the big fuss about this place is. They may just have a great PR team. First attempt at Vetri was just so so. I wrote that visit off as just not finding anything that struck my fancy. Seeing that they seem to have a seasonal menu thought I would wait out the season.  Second try landed flat with same experience as well as subpar service. Have traveled Italy extensively and always search out different regional dishes to try something new. Didn't find that here either time. At the expense of this restaurant, not willing to give it another try."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Friendly service and a clean restaurant, but horrible food. I stopped in on my way to Chicago and asked for a burger with fries and no bun because of celiac.

I requested a medium rare burger and it came out super dark brown, definitely ""well done"". It was also very greasy. The fries had no taste and no salt. The restaurant had no gluten free menu to choose from, but I suppose I should expect that a low dollar restaurant! Applebee's has an extensive GF menu and is quite accommodating. 

The waitress was nice but there's no way I'd ever eat at this chain again."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Came here for lunch today and it was pretty good. I got the pulled pork sandwich and the fries. The sandwich had a nice, thick cut of beef and a nice, crisp, crunchy, lettuce wrap. The fries were fresh and crispy. My boyfriend got the chicken salad sandwich and said it was pretty good. I did get the salad with the fries but I've heard they are a bit pricey. The chicken salad was pretty good. It was a little spicy but not too spicy. I liked the fries."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"EASILY the best sushi in Tampa. The quality is amazing and the sushi is always fresh. If you're looking for the best sushi in Tampa, then this is the place to go. The service is great and the food is amazing. If you are looking for a great sushi place in Tampa, this is the place to go. If you are looking for a cheap sushi experience, this is your place. This place has a lot of choices on the menu and a good selection of sushi."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Had the chicken and sausage and it was good. Not too much flavor but just the right amount.I had the burrito and a friend had the chicken and cheese enchiladas. Both were great. It was a little pricey for what it is, but it was good for the amount of food we got. I would definitely go back.Delicious food and service!  We had the grilled salmon with pork belly and it was delicious!  The prices are very reasonable for what you get!  I'm going"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,This Jimmy John's is about as good as it gets. I will admit that I have been to Jimmy John's several times and I am not a huge fan of the food. I do like that they offer a few different types of meat on their menu. I always get the brisket with turkey. It is a bit dry and flavorless. The sides are also very good. I will say that the service is not bad. I am not sure what all the fuss is about. The wait staff is friendly and quick
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I just left without eating here. The food was just ok. The waitress didn't even acknowledge us. There was a kid's meal at the table next to us. The food was ok. The waitress didn't even greet us. The food was ok. The food was not good. We left. I won't be back.I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami. It was amazing! I can't say enough about the service. They're so kind and accommodating to my boyfriend and I.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"So this is the spot for me, as it is a bit far from my house but the staff is so friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious, and the portions are very large. I highly recommend this place.We went to this restaurant for the first time today. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good we will definitely be back. The pork belly was so good. The shrimp and grits were so good. The spicy wings were so good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,This is my 2nd time here. The food is ok but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the covid. I don't know how they manage to keep things under control. I don't think they really care. I just went there with my family and it was really bad. I will never go back.We had a party of 6 and
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"I took this girl that had an amazing personality and a good attitude. I really appreciate her and we will be back. The food was delicious and the drinks were great. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside seating. The outside seating is very uncomfortable and you would have to stand in a place with a chair and sit on the bench. If you sit on the bench, it is very uncomfortable. I highly recommend this restaurant.I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I go there all the time.  People need to understand that there is a nationwide shortage of staff so complaining about service is not really helpful (unless the servers are rude).   You have to temper your expectations about service in this climate.   The atmosphere is great and the food is always very good.
I love the chicken wings and have gotten the salmon the last two times and it was delicious each time.  The 8 oz steak that my daughter ordered last time was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy.   Hopefully they will have their liquor license back soon."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Checked out this spot based on word of mouth.  Had the brisket, green beans, apples, and baked beans.  Brisket flavor was excellent.  Smokey but unfortunately a bit on the dry side.  Green beans were super soft (almost mushy) and apples were made like Grandma used to.  The cornbread hockey pucks I will be sure to leave on the counter next time.  Kansas City sauce was the ticket and the baked beans weren't too shabby either.  Final take: not worth waiting in line for 20 minutes but if you need a quick meal post party, give er a shot."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"usually i'd love the cheesballieness of hooters and i thought the waitress was playing dumb at first but she wasnt playing.
she actually kept forgetting things,not like a fork either,like pitchers of beer! it was laughable! she took three peoples order at the table and not the other four! wtf? 
i explained to the manager that we all have bad days sometimes and she was nasty to us! like again wtf?
so i got my food when everyone was leaving and of coarse asked for it to go. they discounted the check but for 30 bucks id rather had good service..
hooters is o.k. just not this one."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We have been here several times and the owner is always there, watching his business, and that is the hallmark of a good business.  The ribs and pork are excellent and the homemade sides are delicious. It is a ""line up and order then sit down"" type of place, but I haven't had a problem getting a seat and it seems a large group wouldn't have a problem here.  Parking suuuuuuucks. Just street parking in the Gulch, but enjoy the walk and the view if you can't get a close spot, and bring your quarters in case you have to use a meter."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"There's a reason Mother's has been here for so long.  There's a reason there is a line from 7am until 10pm.  
Great food and Awesome staff. We wanted to dine here for lunch,  saw the line out the door and thought ""wow,  this place must be really, really good"".
Walked around Bourbon Street all afternoon went back to the room to change.  Noticed only a few people in line.  Jumped in gear and got in line for dinner.  We ordered Po Boys (shrimp for me,  wife had turkey) 

Huge Gulf shrimp were falling out of the amazing sandwich!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"We were very skeptical to visit this restaurant based on recent negative reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful food, large portions, and friendly prompt service. We took a large party in during a busy time and they were quite attentive.  The diner is definitely a local place, and it is not a new shiny building, but a cozy local restaurant.  We had the Chicken Fried Steak, the breakfast skillet, BLT, and Mickey Mouse pancakes. The food was great, our only comment was that the chicken fried steak/biscuits & gravy were not to our taste, but the food quality was good."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I just found out about this place, and so far I'm very pleased!
I had a take-out order of the Garlic Shrimp Pasta, Fried Okra, sauteed Corn, and Tiramisu for desert.I
The food we very well seasoned. The fried okra was crispy and the corn  was sweet, and not greasy. I did not like the Tiramisu. I'm not sure if it tasted how it should or if I just don't care for those flavors and textures.
Overall, this was a good choice for American food with a southern twist! I can't wait to sample more of the menu including the chicken fried chicken and the bread pudding!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Very frustrated with the fact that the opportunity to sign up on the waitlist doesn't really matter. It took forever for us to get seated and the manager was rude since we sat at bar and ordered drinks but said that was reserved for people eating. We moved and not one came to eat actually another couple did the same thing as me went to order a drink and sat down while she waited for a table. Just very rude and the bathroom is not nice. I know the food is good but is it worth the wait and hassle and rudeness.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I was here for a weekend brunch and the food was good.  The waitress was nice and we sat down at the bar.  We ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious.  We also ordered the smoked turkey biscuit and it was very good.  The staff was very nice.  I highly recommend it.I had a very good experience here. I got the grilled cheese sandwich, which was very good. The waitress was friendly and quick to refill our waters. The waitress was also very attentive and quick"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We hadn't been here for a while and thought we'd give it a try. I was disappointed. We ordered the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was pretty small and didn't have any flavor. The chorizo was bland and the burrito was cold. The chorizo was flavorless. The chicken was not cooked at all and the chimichanga was burnt. I'm not sure if they didn't have a good selection of ingredients or if they were short on sauce.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This little gem is tucked into a strip mall, which is a nice place to grab a bite.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was amazing. I wish I'd gotten a side of mashed potatoes as I don't like mashed potatoes. 

The service was great and I would definitely come back again.I've been here several times and have had great experiences.  The food is consistently good and the staff is friendly.  

The only downside is that"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I want to like this place. The food is good but it's not great. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and the waffles had a lot of rice. The chicken was not fresh and I would not recommend it. I will not be coming back.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the chef's special, the pork chop with ham and the chicken. Both were delicious and so was the ham. I also ordered a salad,"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Was really looking forward to this place and the food. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the fries. The sandwich had a nice, thick cut of beef and was pretty good. The fries were good and the bread was good. 

I would come back to try the other items on the menu.The food was good, but the service was not. I've had better. I was there on a Thursday night and it was empty. I asked a server if there was a wait for a table and she said no"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Standard Midwest beer selections with some local breweries. We were happy to find a spot to sit down at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The food was great. The cocktails were excellent. The staff was very attentive. This was our first time coming here. We will definitely come back. We had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. We had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork tenderloin and the chicken sandwich. The sandwiches were very tasty and very filling."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Our second visit to this location. The food was ok but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our server was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to this location again I would suggest to order a mimosa and get a glass of water. Otherwise you will be sitting in a very uncomfortable booth with your drink cold and your food cold. I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I was fortunate to get a table outside with a large group of people who were enjoying their meals.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection. It was served on a bed of tenderloin with some veggies and a perfectly cooked steak. The steak was juicy and tender, and the steak was cooked to perfection. I will say that the steak was not bad, it was just not as tender as I would prefer. The steak was cooked perfectly, and the veggies"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Excellent sushi!!  The sushi chef is also the owner, so he takes great pride in his sushi. There is a wide selection of sushi items, along with other menu items. The presentation is exquisite. I'm a big Spicy Tuna roll lover, and theirs is the best I have tasted by far in many years. The sushi always tastes fresh. My husband is vegan, and they also have a large selection of rolls for vegans, which is reasonably priced. He loves it!  Please check out this wonderful restaurant in a non-descript shopping plaza. You won't be disappointed, and we want to keep them in business!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Out of all the options for your quintessential Italian ""on the hill"", this is a must try. The food is great and the service is even better. Our group tried a variety of all the signature dishes from wine recommendations toasted ravioli, arancini, baked spaghetti and meatballs to the desserts with a cannoli and triple chocolate cake.
I had the shrimp scampi which was incredible. It was different than expected as I've only ever had shrimp scampi's with a oily sauce and this was more of a creamy lemon sauce. Was just trick enough and left nothing to be desired. I highly recommended this to any visitors."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"This is a great family restaurant and does a brisk pizza to go business.They are not my favorite tomato cheese pizza but they are better than average.I used to like to go in and get a breakfast pizza that was excellent though.I have had very good chicken parm.sandwiches and dinner is always a  very generous portion.Guiseppes in Richboro has been good to the community and has generously given to many schools in our area.If you want real Italians cooking your food this is the place for you.It is clean ,fast ,fairly priced and kid friendly.I think the wait service has been here since they opened.."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Ordered a hoagie and some garlic knots 3o minutes before they close. Most of the food was being put away. The server was prepared to make me whatever I ordered, which I found to be very nice of them. I ordered a hoagie and garlic knots with sauce. The sandwich was pretty good. Crispy bread, loaded with meat, the knots were so delicious. Plenty garlic and the sauce was incredible.  For a quick stop I had a great meal and good talk with the guys there. I recommend this place and plan to return to try their pizza, which I was told is pretty good."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My husband and I are food people....especially when it comes to asian food. We were walking around the music festival in Wayne and saw dan dan had a stand so we got two orders of different noodles. When I tell you we were upset when we got home that we didn't get more....I'm not even kidding. Cat, the owner, was so lovely and we live right next door and can't wait to stop in and grab more noodles. The dan dan noodles were amazing. But the ones with the cucumber were another level of delicious. There's also outdoor seating...who doesn't love that??? Ok, now go there."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My daughter and I stopped here before walking up and down State Street. I got a curry, and she got soft noodles with chicken. The noodles were just okay, it had vegetables cooked just right but there was  nothing extraordinary. The curry was absolutely delicious and flavorful! The only fault was that it was so flavorful that you wouldn't want to eat the whole thing by itself or by yourself. It needed some bland food mixed in with it. But I have had that experience before with Vietnamese food. The restaurant was clean and tidy. Decor is more mainstream mixed in with some Vietnamese highlights."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Visitors beware. We were told we could have a table in 30 minutes. We waited at the bar. What appeared to  be the owner went up to several folks around us say he would have a table for them. While we sat waiting the table behind us had issues were 1 person did not get their order and another had to send their steak back. We were then told about 1 hour in that they were not going to seat us and we would have to eat at the bar if we wanted food in a not very respectful way. I will never go back.
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"8:30 am on a Sunday, 30 people in the restaurant and they're out of coffee. Seriously, I don't know what was going on here, but the staff seemed completely confused. 

The coffee thing was too much. I'm sorry, but if you last brewed coffee at 6:30 and the place is busy, you might want to think about brewing some more. 

Other than the lack of coffee and the huge line that reached back to the door, the food was the same as always. So, it was good. I'm not a huge fan of Panera. I'd give them about 3/5 for their food on a normal day."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,We went here last night and it was the best experience I have had in a long time. The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious. The drinks are great too. I would definitely go back. It's in a beautiful location on Mass Ave. This is a great place for a special occasion.The service was great and the food was great! The owner was so sweet and made sure we were taken care of.  We will definitely be coming back.This place is great!  We had the lobster mac and cheese and
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Etch was highly praised all around. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a Brie dish. The Brie was the bomb. It was very good. My husband had the Shrimp and grits. He said it was good. He also had the crawfish etoufee. I had the Beef and chicken and it was excellent. I also had the quiche. It was very good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I wanted to try something different.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Really disappointed.  Haven't eaten here in a while, but I will keep going back.Very good. Very friendly service. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside tables were dirty. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place.The food is good, but the service is not. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken sandwich. It's very dry. The sandwiches were very good, but the"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Our experience here was fantastic! We had the Ribeye and the Mac & Cheese. I was blown away by the mac & cheese. The ribeye was the best I've ever had and the Mac & Cheese was excellent. The flavor was superb. I would come back to try their other items. They also have a great beer selection. Definitely a great place to eat!I really love this place. It's so close to my house and I love it all. I love the service and the food is amazing.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Great cupcakes, outstanding customer service. We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is very friendly and helpful.  He is the best customer service I have ever experienced.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and it was great! I will definitely be back.I ordered a hamburger medium rare. It came out medium well and I was able to tell it was cooked perfectly. I would not have ordered it if I wasn't told"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Excellent food!! And service!!!
Just stopped here for the first time in Nashville and I can't believe I haven't been here before. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer because it is located in a strip mall. If you are looking for great food, I would recommend the pork chop with ham and the chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The prices are fair, too"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Terrific space to greet and eat. The food is amazing. My husband and I both ordered the duck confit. It was the best duck I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly and it came with a side of sweet potato fries. The best part was the service. The waitress was great. She was very friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend!Delicious food and service! I will definitely be back. The pork belly was my favorite. The shrimp and grits were delicious. The burger was amazing.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Vietnam Cafe has always offered some of the best food in the city. This is the first restaurant to offer an authentic Vietnamese dish. The food is served fresh and tasty. The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back soon!This is a great place for a date night. The food is amazing and the service is great. They have live music on Sundays and they have a good selection of wines and beers. I love their sweet potato fries and their house made coffee
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Hadn't been here for a while so thought I'd bring a newbie to see how he liked it.

Of course he enjoyed it! Between happy hour and half off bottle night it was a great deal.

He got the tuna melt with chips..I got the roast beef with split pea soup. Both were really good but that soup rocked! Really good. Tuna salad was good as well with not too much mayo and some crisp celery thrown in

Service is always good and friendly and I always run into someone I know as a lot of people are regulars there. Good mixed crowd too..no creepy regulars like some places attract."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Totally love this place, I am a big fan of Dim Sum and these guys have a great variety of dishes from sticky rice to pork dumplings to their famous tea. 
There were 7 of us, we had a big table, service was fast and the place was packed. I only wish that it didn't cost so much - but then again I probably wouldn't stop eating. 
The only reason for the 4 star is that I'm not a big fan of the smell in there, perhaps it's the carpet, but would recommend to anyone that loves dim sum, just watch because the bill adds up quick!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We LOVE LOVE LOVE Burger Me!!!!!!  Brought the kids here today and we love everything we've ever tried..Today we did the ""happy hour"" Cheeseburger, fries and soda for $5.95 which I think usually runs closer to $9....I personally think the regular prices are fair for the quality, but $5.95 is a steal!!!! ....When they were only in Truckee, we used to drive there JUST to eat there....so glad they opened in Reno.....Sadly, we are moving over the hill so we won't get to eat there as often as we do now...If you care about where your food comes from, this is the burger joint for you!!!!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Today I decided to pop my Chipotle cherry. A lot of coworkers have raved about how awesome it is and after seeing meal after meal make its way into our break room, I decided it was time for me to get a taste.

Although the location and layout may be less than ideal (if you see the door placement vs the line you'll see what I mean), the service and quality was great. I ordered a cheese quesadilla with sour cream on the side for under $5.

Definitely a good place to try out a burrito bowl or quasadilla if you happen to be at the Plymouth Meeting mall!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This was a great place for some food and a break from Broadway bar life. 

The food was flavorful, they had some great drinks and the bartender was just the nicest guy! The hot chicken pizza with a ranch crust was out if this world and the Mac and cheese with hot chicken was a close second- we just love the hot chicken! And we got the Nashville hot and didn't find it to be too spicy.

The atmosphere was great and the bartender was super cool. I'd highly recommend this place for a bite and it's still great to people watch (from the air conditioned bar/dining room)."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The food was ok. We waited quite a while for bagels that could have been a bit fresher, in my opinion. Maybe it was an off day, but the reason we probably won't go back is because of the poor attitude of the woman who identified herself as the manager. She made us feel like it was a nuisance to take our bagel order, which was nothing out of the ordinary. I can see from some of the other reviews here that her attitude was not just an off day, but the general demeanor of who they chose to manage the place and interact with their patrons."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The waiter frequently interjected on our conversation and was over bearing. He tried to convince me to change my order to an item more expensive than the one I ordered. The shrimp scampi was not good. The shrimp was over cooked and tasted like it had been boiled. The sauce it came swimming in tasted like a dry white wine. There was no garlic flavor. The sauce hadn't been reduced at all. The scampi was only moderately warm, and not at all what was expected. We were a party of 5 and the waiter added an 18% gratuity to the bill without letting us know about it."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"5 stars for New Hope family Italian pizza joint. 

The service is friendly and fast with attention to children. 

The pizza is some of the best around. There crust is soft and chewy inside with a crisp crunch outside. Reminiscent of NYC but a lot friendlier.  

The mild wings are big and juicy perfect for the kids with a little more heat than they are used to eating. 

I can't wait to go back and try their pasta dishes. The toppings are plentiful with some great options like Grandma style.  

My family and I plan to be regulars. The price of beers aren't bad either."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I ordered the Roast Beef and it was just as good as it looked! The BBQ sauce was just right and the flavor was spot on. The salad was tasty and the fries were nice and crisp. It was a little pricey for what it is, but it was worth it. I'd come back again!They have a great variety of options to choose from. They have a lot of different options for beer and wine. The service was excellent. I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Very cool little bistro with a bunch of local beers. I will definitely come back!Very good. Very friendly service. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside seating. The outside seating is very small and you would have to stand a bit to get to the bar. The food was good and I think the portions were very good. I will definitely be back. We were on a road trip and needed a quick lunch before we headed to the airport.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Everything we had was exceptional. We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent. The food is amazing. The eggplant parm was tasty. The sausage and cheese with the mushrooms and the eggplant parm was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the mushroom chorizo. The service is also fantastic. The wait staff is very attentive and the food is just great. This is a great place to have a good meal. I highly recommend it.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Just had a delicious 2 course meal and the food was good. The only thing I would change is the dessert. The ice cream is the best part. The dessert is so worth it. The staff was very friendly. I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant and was looking for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the Margarita and the Caprese tacos. I got the Caprese tacos with beef and the Margarita with shrimp. Both were delicious.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I have lost faith in this place and the food is just ok. The cheese steak was just ok. The mac and cheese was alright. The fried chicken was okay. The fries were ok. The only thing I really liked about this place is the decor and the food. The staff is always nice. I have to give it 3 stars because the food was ok but the service was terrible. I went there with my dad and it was really loud. We had to ask for our water glasses to be refilled.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did! The food was awesome. We had the burrito, which was also delicious! The chicken was great as well. I had the chicken and waffles which were both delicious. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and it was great! I will definitely be back and I will definitely try the corn bread next time!This place is amazing! I was there for brunch and it was a perfect day for me to stop in for brunch."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Although a little busier than usual, the food was good. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and we shared a side of fries. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and great. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fry was overcooked. My husband had the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I had the pork chop and it was good but nothing special. I liked my meal more than I did the service. The manager was very nice and very accommodating. Overall it was a great experience."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We enjoyed the food. My husband had the seafood combo which was a nice size portion. We ordered the gnocchi and the duck, both were excellent. The wine was great as well. We will definitely come back. We went to this restaurant for the first time today. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good we will definitely be back. The pork belly was so good. The shrimp and grits were so. The burger was amazing."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I love the food here. The lettuce wraps are my favorite. I do have to admit that on a Thursday night for a table for 7 people I got a reservation only at 8:30 PM, though I called 4 hours in advance.

We got a table with not enough space on it. Most of the time we had to juggle things. I specifically asked the waiter if the portion sizes were bigger or enough just for one person, he told me they are for a single person. I don't know why he had to mislead us, though we spent more money we didn't mind the left overs next day."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,i love their bagels but today i ordered two dozen bagels for someone's birthday at the office and when i went to pick them up learned they weren't sliced.  i asked about it and they said slicing them costs extra but they weren't interested in doing that even though i offered to pay. The place was empty.  Not even a thank you when i left.  I mean they sell bagels. You can't slice the bagels?  I've never bought a bagel that wasn't sliced in half from anywhere in the history of time.  Even the frozen things at grocery stores are sliced in half.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"In Reno The BEST Mexican Tacos in town! I only eat this good at home. I have never tasted ""lengua tacos"" as good as my moms cooking. I use to drive to TJ to go eat tacos in my early years and I can truly say This place is just as good if not better. I felt at home in my moms kitchen eating the tacos.. we ordered lengua, asada, chorizo and they were all delicious. If you come make sure and try the Chorizo and Lengua they were amazing. Whenever I come to Reno I know where to stop. The people working are very welcoming and polite."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Overall, good experience. Started with the deviled eggs, which were good, but needed just a slight kick in flavor after the bite of shrimp. I had the duck sliders, which were very good, my only critique was that the carrot slaw was directly on the bottom of the bun, which made them soggy. The French fries were also delicious (they would be perfect with an aioli dipping sauce). My fiancé had the burger, which he said was very good. The bun was soft, which really made it delicious. We will definitely go back. I need to try the bacon (mmm bacon). The whisky sour was also very tasty!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My friends and I visited this restaurant on a quick getaway to New Orleans. The service was excellent and our server Sterlin was wonderful, he alone is the reason for two stars. However, the food was completely overrated. A few friends ordered the pork and shared it with the others. It was chewy and bland. I ordered the Pompano Pontchartrain, it was a complete waste of a plate. Incredibly tasteless, no flavor and bland. I am not sure why this restaurant is five star restaurant and have the nerve to overcharge on tasteless cuisine. Go to Red Fish Grill if you want a great meal and skip Antoines."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The best part of French Toast was our waitress Misty.  She was attentive, personable and just so professional.  When one dish was delayed, she came out, apologized and gave the exact time it would be coming out.  My sister wanted the hanger steak , but Misty wouldn't let her order it until she went back into the kitchen to make sure they hadn't run out.  When I ordered my eggs over easy with the croque madam she suggested over medium because over easy would be to runny for the croque.  Delicious food and an amazing server.  Thanks Misty-we will be back tomorrow!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"It amazes me how delco residents gladly rave about and choose big portions of slop over normal portions of good food. If you gave the goofballs in this area 2 pounds of bologna on a hotdog roll, they would claim it to Be the greatest hoagie on earth, as long as it was a cheap price. That is Leo's in a nutshell. Terrible rolls, with a decent amount of grade Z meat burnt to a crisp with a quart of added grease. These people around here need to get jobs and some gas money together so they can take a short drive and learn about actual good food."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Let me start by saying that I have been a local and a Brophy's fan all my life. I am so excited to have OTA out in Goleta. I was really looking forward to fish and chips tonight, so I picked up a to-go order. When I got home, there was no lemon or tartar sauce in the container! So bummed out for paying that much for dry fish and fries. I hope they can get their system down so this kind of sacrilege doesn't happen again. Turns out the sriracha ranch dressing I had in my fridge was a good substitute, but still a little disappointed :("
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Elegant and comfortable- this restaurant is an easy walk to and from. The food is always delicious and the service is always great. I think this place is going to be a regular stop for me. I will most likely be going back to try the other items on the menu. The service was great and the food was great! The owner was so sweet and made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be coming back. This is a great place for lunch or dinner.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Don't go for the food. We had the crab cakes which were cold and doughy. The crab cakes were so small that they didn't even have crab meat. The crab cakes were so thick that they had no flavor. The crab cakes were also cold. This is a very poor dining experience.We ordered the chicken nachos and the guacamole. The guacamole was very good, but the chicken was dry and tasted like it came from a can. The chicken was very dry, and the guacam"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Warning: Not for the socially distanced, loud crowd. I saw people who were drinking and just drinking. 

If you're looking for some good food, this is definitely not the place to go. It's a little pricey for what you get and the food isn't anything special. I'd recommend going to the bar and grabbing a drink and having some beers.I love this place. It's so fun to watch the games on TV. The prices are very reasonable. The food is amazing.

It's a little pricey but it's worth it!The best pizza in the city.  I have tried the NY style, the chicken and waffles and the bread pudding.  My favorite is the New York style.  The waffles are a perfect combination of sweet and salty.  My only complaint is that the"

I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to enjoy it with a friend. I will say that I had to ask for a few times to get everything together. I was so excited to try this place because it's the only restaurant in
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Update: I went back to eat here and the food was good but not spectacular. I ordered the chicken fried rice and the dish came out before the meal even started. I was very disappointed that it came out before the meal even started. The food was ok and the service was good. I would recommend to anyone looking for authentic Chinese food in the area. I love this place! I go there often for lunch and I love the atmosphere and the customer service! It's very clean, they have a lot of options for the menu."

The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are hungry and you are not going to eat, this is your place.If you are looking for a cheap sushi experience, this is your place. This place has a lot of good choices, but nothing that I would consider worth the money. I would say the best sushi around, but"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'm soooo happy I found this place!! It was super empty when I went Sunday around 330/4. Employees were all definitely students and they're not always the most friendliest, but it was very quick and tasted delicious so I'm not complaining!

I got a large, with half sushi rice half salad, 2 scoops salmon, 1 scoop edamame, 1 scoop spicy tuna and 1 scoop scallops, then I put avocado, green onions, seaweed salad, furikake and masago. Everything tasted really fresh and I enjoyed every single bite. 

Definitely going to be going more often! I also love that they have drinks to buy right in the same place! Super great idea"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Not sure why it's taken me so long to write this review. My husband and I eat here 2-3 times per month and we love it! Their menu has something for everyone and I've never had anything I didn't like. Some of my go-to's are the turkey burger, the Kona chopped salad, the sweet chili salmon and any of the sushi. The fudge brownie dessert is to die for. 

The happy hour menu is also GREAT and very well priced, but get there early or you'll have to hover around until a table becomes available. 

Oh, and if wine is your thing, all bottles are half off on Wednesdays."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here with my friends on a trip. It was bomb! and they're open late. the pizza is really well done- we had the South Side Classico. Definitely worth it! The atmosphere of this place is very chill and calm, music choice was good. Service was great and they accommodated for us even though we came near closing time. We weren't able to try any of the drinks (I'm not 21 yet) but they looked amazing and would definitely try them if I'm back and of age. 

If you're ever in downtown St. Louis and need a late night place to eat, I would highly suggest to come here."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My first Fuel experience was at the Center City location, using a groupon. I got the Thai chicken panini and was underwhelmed. My dining companions both got the Turkey panini and refused to share.

Fast forward a few weeks later, I just started my job in the Passyunk Square area, and needed a quick lunch to go. I walk into Fuel, order the Turkey panini, and I'm on my way. My god it is delicious. It's the best Roasted Turkey I've ever had.

I will go back there again and again. They have a VIP card for those who frequently order drinks, I only wish they had one for sandwich people."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I have been here many times but this is the first for ladies night. Totally unacceptable wait time with our server for EVERYTHING! AT first we were understanding as we were a larger party but the wait continued to increase after each course. Our server kind of had a passive aggressive attitude towards us and kept saying she wasn't rushing us when in reality we were trying to get her to get the meal going. We had to wait for drinks to be refilled, abnormally long wait times between courses and waiting for the check to be picked up was absolute ridiculous! We almost took our checks up front."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Best place I've been for breakfast since I moved to Tampa!   The place is sort of a dive joint but the staff makes you feel at home. When you walk in you see people all over the restaurant with balloon animals/art/characters on their heads.  The guy making them has to be an ex-Disney employee.  Some of the things he creates are amazing. I am from Texas so my eyes popped when I saw chicken fried steak on the menu.  Great choice!  The meals are served with a pastry basket that could easily make a good breakfast by itself. Look forward to going back.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went here with my boyfriend for valentines day 2011. We had 8 oclock reservations and arrived right at 8 and there was a huge line. Surprisingly we got seated right away.

Over all, the service was a little slow, and we were packed and I kept getting bumped by the waiters here and there, but I loved the food so I dint mind sitting and talking to my hubby. I got the lobster and filet mignon and crepes. Also for dessert I got the tera me sue.

The wine with the food was very satisfying and it wasn't one of those awkward romantic places so it was perfect for us."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Sat at the bar with friends. Pretty much always sit there cause I love talking to Eddie, the best bartender in town. The man can mix!  
Started with the pouting. New experience for me, I'd only read about it, you know Canada's favorite side dish.  Enjoyed it, but a bit rich with the fries, duck gravy, duck confit, and foie gras. My bar mates shared it with me. Followed by one of their great burgers. Blue cheese, bacon, the works! Delicious. Also dipped into my friend's tartare. All in all a pretty carnivorous night. Oh yeah, it was happy hour so each of these items was $7.00."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I ate here for brunch last night and the food was good. The waitress was nice and we sat down at the bar. We ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious. We also ordered the smoked turkey biscuit and it was very good. The staff was very nice. I highly recommend it. I had the crab cake with a side of the cheesecake. It was amazing! I can't say enough about this place. I would go back again!I had the lobster mac and cheese.
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"How stupid it is?! I asked for the receipt and they said it was my birthday! I said we will be right back! I then asked to speak to a manager. She said she was taking care of everything. I explained I was on vacation. She said ""there are no reviews"" and gave me the receipt. I told her I had to call the owner to check if the receipt was my birthday. She then said ""well if you don't have a receipt, then you can't have your receipt. "" I said okay."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I have been here twice now and the food is consistently good.  The first time I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious.  The second time I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it was excellent.  I will be back for the gnocchi.Great food, great service. 
The food is always good and the service is always excellent. 
We love the atmosphere, the staff, the atmosphere is always clean and inviting.
The only thing that could have made this place better was the service.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I would have given 5 stars if I could. I will say that the service was horrible. The waiter had a bad attitude. The drinks were not good. The food was mediocre. It was good, but nothing special. I will not be coming back. I would rather pay a premium for quality food and service. I love this place! I go there often for lunch and I love the atmosphere and the customer service! It's very friendly and attentive!I've been here a few times."

I had the Chicken Parmesan and it was good, but nothing special.  I also had the Chicken Fettuccine.  I love the flavor of the chicken, and it is a little sweet.  I just didn't care for it.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because of the fact that it is a little hard to get in"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Went on a Friday night. Super slow food service. I mean the waitress was fine but I think the kitchen was way understaffed (especially for a weekend.) took a long time to get the food. To be honest we asked for our order to be cancelled but were assured ours was being cooked then(still took another 10 min.)

When the food got there it was ok.... edible. But far from the best Indian food I've had, even in Tucson. Got the garlic naan, which was under flavored and the chicken tiki masala, which again was really under flavored.

Do yourself a favor and drive a little farther for much better Indian food."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,Went to this Dunkin and had a meeting with a co worker in the restaurant. I came out to see that the employees of this DD wrote on the side of my car with a marker that the parking was for customers only and next time they will have me towed. Next time they should check the inside of their restaurant to see if anyone was parked there. I can't wrap my head around who would think this was a good idea. I would have got the message if you would have wrote it on paper and put it under my windshield wiper. Still completely in dismay that this happened.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'm giving it a ""5"" with slight reservations. Can someone explain to me why I would ever want to eat a huge messy order like that in my car? Are there still drive in theaters that I can take a hot date to and accidentally ""spill"" some thousand island on her blouse? No. This is 2016. I just want my drive thru order in a paper bag so nothing gets spilled. 

Staff is always nice. I think my waistline is the only thing that doesn't like you guys. Best item of the ""secret menu"":  neopalaton  shakes, fried pickles, chocolate stuffed deep fried twinkles, and waterproof animal style bibs."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I have been here a few times, and each time the quality seems to go down a little bit. It is clean, and does not have that strange smell that I sometimes get when I walk into Chinese restaurants. My husband thinks that my taste is off since I am pregnant, but the Mongolian Beef was just not good, and my chicken did not have enough breading. The Hot and Sour soup was yummy though as well as the little wonton strips they serve you. The combo prices can not be beat. We will be back for sure, I just hope it is as good as it used to be!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Just reopened this week!  The food here is super fresh, staff is top shelf & the rolls are
Kick ass. They serve the freshest seafood in the area. Our waitress was amazing. Wife had colossal Shrimp scampi and I had crab cake, scallop with colossal shrimp (all grilled) with side salad with fennel and apple slices. All served with a mustard sauce. Dessert was fresh Key Lime Pie and chocolate covered ice cream bon bons. A five star meal from one of our favorite eateries in King of Prussia. Alexis was our server and she was attentive, courteous and overall wonderful."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,This place is amazing. The fresh variety of foods available here boggles my mind every time. The Amish places are my absolute favorite no doubt. The place way in back next to the bread bakery place is the best for chili! cheap too. GREAT lemonade. Best I've ever had actually. The fruit places are cheap too. I saw blood oranges for 3 a dollar! Those are expensive suckers and that was cheap! White asparagus too! The meats aren't bad either and that old used book store is adorable. It's a wonderful place and I just can't say enough about it. If you're visiting do yourself a favor and go! :)
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Wish I had checked Yelp before eating.  Lot of options in downtown Nashville.  Not sure why I thought a Jimmy Buffet restaurant would be a good one.  Place was busy.  Service good, decor excellent.  Nice videos playing on many tvs with good sound.  The problem - the food is bad.  Kind of link a mash of everything you find in a Chilis, Applebees, etc.  Unfortunately, it's insulting Chilis and Applebees to draw a comparison.  One of us got sick, the other just had an upset stomach.  Seriously, can't listen to Jimmy's music without remembering this place:-(

Try something else when downtown..."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Literally never coming back. Cashier was rude to my friend bc I guess they have beef or whatever but you're at work? Pizza took a long time to be made and theres parts of the pizza that have no toppings, on the left you can see where the dough wasn't even pressed together, the one on the left was shredded. The crust was hella stiff and al kinda of bent in the box . The girl was wearing a red sweater and told her coworkers that her hands were shaking from anger in front of my friend and I. And honestly I wish she wouldve tried me instead of staring."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"So apparently the grill cook doesn't know how to cook a properly cooked steak. I was pretty disappointed. 

If you're looking for some good steak, this is it. We had the steak and eggs over medium rare, and it was tender and cooked to perfection. The potatoes were a bit too tough, and the greens were a bit too greasy. 

We didn't get a chance to try the dessert, but we did try a few other things on the menu. I would say the coffee was great, and the service"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Carrabbas just might be my favorite place in the area. I always love this place! I'm always a fan. Their salads are always fresh and tasty. They have a nice variety of salads and soups. I've tried a few different things on the menu and have always been impressed. I also love the fact that they serve breakfast items on their menu as well. They have a great menu with lots of different items to choose from. I always feel very comfortable eating here and have never felt rushed.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Went last night. I had a mushroom curry and a chicken curry. The curry was awesome. The chicken curry was the best.

The salad bar is huge and I love that it's made fresh. The staff is always friendly. This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we were very disappointed. We ordered the crab cake appetizer and my husband had the pork chop entree. The crab cake entree was very dry. The pork chop entree was very dry."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"If only I could find a place that does it right.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I wish they would get the Treme. The crepe was amazing, and the bread was good, but they need to get some training on the ingredients. I love a good Treme, and I've had better.

I think they need to get some training on the ingredients. Maybe they should ask their chef what ingredients they are using, or they should have them get their own bread, because I really hate bread"

Super Rica is super simple, menu on a chalk board, Tacos only, order one or one of each.

Our granddaughters called us and was crying to see us so we jumped in the car and got there as soon as possible. After leaving the granddaughters smiling and laughing we ordered a pizza from Greek's and got there to pick it up and we thought the other one would pay. Lol. Nope!!! Luckily Kathy was working and was very understanding and went above and beyond to help us out. Needless to say we didn't go hungry!!! Thanks so much Kathy!!! We love Greek's Pizzeria on 71st and Binford!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is going to be my favorite happy hour place.
Service: Try to sit by the bar to be impressed by some bartending skills. If you're not too sure of what to pick - let the bartender know of your preference and be prepared to be pleasantly surprised.
Great service, although could be a long wait if you don't have a reservation.

The rum and berries was one of those not on the menu but customized for when I asked for a fruity cocktail with rum. Highly recommend!!!!
We enjoyed the warm spiced peanuts and several plates of potato croquettes with chipotle aioli sauce. 

Overall a tapas place with a cozy ambiance and classy decor."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Great location and facility.  The pools and trails to the beach are perfectly designed.  My family enjoyed the pools, beach, and making S'mores at the fire pits.  That said, its the little things in life that matter.  The TV in our room did not work, despite three engineers working on it.  We never heard from the front desk, except on check out when I got an ""oh yeah ... sorry about that.""  They do not answer the phones. And the staff at the front desk and the Bistro are unfriendly.  The valet and poolside staff were great though.  Overall, we won't be back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Called in an order for chicken tika masala and paneer saag and was told 30 minutes. Got to restaurant after 20 minutes. As I was paying, I was told with attitude that they had said 30 mins on the phone because they're busy. Parking lot had only 1 car. No delivery drivers came through the door. One table was there with customers looking around to get service.  Food was ready after 50 mins. When I got home, naan is burnt, tika Masala and saag are very watery. There was very small amount of chicken and paneer. There are other great Indian restaurants on Keystone Ave. Will not be returning here."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is a small place I've been for brunch a few times and just to grab a piece of cake sometimes as well. It's an old stone building with plenty of character and charm and it has easy parking right on premesis. Outstanding, even on a busy Mothers day brunch crunch. Been here a few times now and always pleased with meal, service and atmosphere. The place was so busy, but the hostess was very attentive, seated people as quickly as they rose from the table to leave (turnover was awesome). Highly recommend this establishment.  Also the prices are quite reasonable for the location, atmosphere and high quality prepared food."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Like all diners, this place had a huge selection on its menu.  Since it's the only diner in town that we saw you may not have a choice for late dining.  The seafood plates that our party had was really good.  I think we had the broiled tilpia, broiled scrod, and mixed seafood plate.

Desserts are huge both in size and selection.  They have all kinds of cheesecakes, carrot cakes, chocolate cakes, and other cakes that I cant even name.

Waitress that we had had a Jersey attitude (dont ask me the difference between the Jersey and Philly attitudes) but other waiting staff we saw were all very friendly."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We decided to try out Yellow Belly this weekend and we are glad we did. Plenty of outdoor seating was available, so we felt super comfortable. 

They have a good variety of items on the menu. Think elevated comfort food! They also have a great beer and wine selection. If you have  been wanting to try  Pliney the Elder this is your new favorite spot!

We both ended up ordering the Yellow Belly burger. Burger was juicy and well seasoned. The burger came on a huge brioche bun with caramelized onions. Very good!

We will go back again and try more items on the menu! Staff was also very friendly! :)"

This place has the best food and service. I have been to several of their locations and have never had a bad experience."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I LOVE their lunch buffet. We have been there many times and it's always great! I recommend the chicken and waffles and the spinach salad. The salad is a nice sized portion and the chicken is cooked to perfection. The waffles are also very good and creamy. If you have the time to spare, they have the most vegetarian options. The service is always excellent and the prices are reasonable. I recommend the chicken and waffles and the spinach salad!

The restaurant has a very personable appeal, welcoming, cute, and homey. I can tell there are a good amount of regulars. I had made reservations for Sunday brunch for a party of 4 because I was informed that it can get quite busy. We were immediately greeted and seated. It wasn't as busy as we had anticipated. The service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. My husband and I shared both the stuffed french toast with bacon and the Eggs Benny. The food was very good and The portion was just right."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If this was in our old area- it would a 3 but for Treasure Valley- it's a four only because it was the best Asian food we've found since moving here.  It's the only place we've tried that we'd go back to (and I can walk there from our apartment if I wanted to).  

Food was fresh.  I had the chicken and beef teriyaki combo with double fried rice.  Husband had the Katsu and teriyaki combo- also double fried rice.  

The beef was my husband's favorite (even if it was my food), but the chicken teriyaki was good too.  For quick takeout dinner- worth the money."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went here for a co-workers going away party on Whiskey Wednesday.

All of the whiskey in the world for half price, what's better than that?  Beer is reasonably priced as well.  I've eaten here on other occasions and the food is...  just okay.

After slamming back about 15 Green Tea shots we got our mojo working on the patio.  Heaters, tables, and cigars were at our disposal.  

The bar was busy, the service was slow-ish, but they were incredibly polite and had a lot going on.

Live DJ was tearing up the tables, this made for awesome atmosphere.

Definitely will return.  This is a destination spot and best on Wednesdays!"
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"This is literally the worst place for delivery. Not sure if it's their fault or door dash but either way I've had more issues here than I would like to admit. I'm dumb for continuing to order knowing it's always fucked up. Today I got TWO wrong orders back to back and can't get ahold of anyone in store or online or anything to talk to me. I wanna come pick up my RIGHT order. After paying and tipping these people and ending up with NOTHING I CAN EAT hours later and reordering after the first fuck up, I can promise y'all I won't be ordering anymore. Try Moe's up the street."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,So I never write reviews. Ever. My friend and I decided to try somewhere new and came here. We ordered queso to start and it tasted like jarred Tostitos queso thrown in the microwave. We then each ordered a quesadilla. She ordered shrimp fajita quesadilla and it came out with steak and shrimp and no fajita vegetables. I ordered a chorizo quesadilla and it did not taste good at all. We are not picky eaters whatsoever but we did not like the food and it was not authentic. The only thing that was good was service. The server was very kind as well as the manager. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Just had a horrible experience as we were eating takeout and my wife noticed a shard of metal in her food. I called the place and they were like oh yea that's from the grill brush like it was no big deal! Went back to the restaurant and showed them and she was laughing about it with the kitchen staff. Then she was shocked when I wanted my money back as she thought I just wanted a redo of their contaminated food. Never once apologized and didn't realize the severity of the situation. I will never go there again and hope I can save someone else from a terrible experience as well.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was in the area and saw that this restaurant had good reviews. This place was Awesome!!! The atmosphere was fantastic for 2 people or a group of 8. The decor was country / modern with great art on the walls. Our waitress was the nicest and clearly experienced she made the evening very enjoyable. The food was PERFECT! I had the veggie sandwich, my group had white pizza, margarita with extra cheese pizza, chicken pesto sandwich, and eggplant sandwich. Everyone loved their meals. The place was clean and you can tell it is privately owned and run with care and passion for the food and business. I will definitely be back!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We came here for lunch with my persian class! They took great care of us! Food was authentic persian food and nothing less than what you expect, service was acceptable, they didn't refill our drinks more than twice so that's the only part that could improve (4 stars) considering the amount of spices on the plates we need water constantly. However the food was delicious. The managers took great care of us & spoke to us in Farsi and helped us feel at home. It was great! Iranian music playing & you're just at home while eating! They gave us a tour and really made us feel at home! Very respectful service"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was a nice dinner. I ordered the duck confit and the fries. The duck was cooked perfectly and the fries were very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the duck. I would definitely come back. Great food, great service. The food is always good and the service is always excellent. We love the atmosphere, the staff, the atmosphere is always clean and inviting. The only thing that could have made this place better was the service."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Thankfully they came by our table and asked how we were doing. We told them we were just sitting there and we had to get up.  The waitress was not attentive at all and we had to ask her to get us a manager.  She then brought our food back and we said no more.  She came back and said she had to get us a manager.  She brought our food back and we said no more.  The manager came back and said he had to get us a manager.  I have never heard of a manager that had to
Restaurants,4.5,CG,So I think I took a break and ate dinner. I will say that the service was pretty good. There was a server who was very friendly and the food was pretty good.I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to try something new since I heard so much about it. I was not disappointed. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The staff is very attentive and friendly. I ordered the crab cakes. They were very good and the
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Looking for a 50s style diner with the best food in Nashville?  This is the place!  We had the burrito, a burrito with chorizo, a cheese tortilla, and a side of guacamole.  Everything was very good.  The chorizo was a little tough, but it was good.  The cheese tortilla was also very good.  The guacamole was pretty good.  I'd definitely go back for that.  I had the house made chips, which was really good. "
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The food and service are both excellent and the food is good. 

The only thing I would change is the dessert. The ice cream is the best part. The dessert is so worth it. 

The only reason this is not 5 stars is because the service was not great. The waiter was very busy and seemed to be overworked. I think the manager could have been a little more attentive. 

I really like this place.This is a great place for a quick bite to eat, quick service, and great prices. "
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This restaurant had at least one of the best food trucks I've ever seen. I was there to eat and have a drink. The food was fantastic! I got the pork belly tacos and it was so good. I would definitely come back. If I was to eat here again I would definitely get a margarita!They are a great restaurant and it is a great place to go for a great meal! I highly recommend it! The service was excellent and the food was great! I highly recommend this place!I've been here twice, first for lunch"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Place was terrible! Food was not good at all. We ordered a chicken salad, a shrimp and grits, and the fries. The fries were dry, and the chicken was cold. The chicken was extremely tough and tasteless. The shrimp and grits were good, but not great. We did not order a side of fries, but had to wait 30 minutes for them to come out. My husband had the pork chop, and he thought it was excellent. The wait for the food was very long, but we were given no notice."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,We went to yelp to find a place with good reviews. We tried the yellowtail and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was okay. It was very small but it was well seasoned. The yellowtail was a little too salty for my taste. I think it's because of the seasoning. The gnocchi was good but nothing special. I just didn't care for it. The gnocchi was a little salty for me. I think it was just the seasoning.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"It's a great place to have a pizza night with family. Servers are pleasant and they are following the CDC guidelines. Tables were properly marked to keep the customers away from one another. There were plenty of outside seating. We chose to dine inside. Our server wore the mask. We ordered couple of nonalcoholic drinks (pretty inexpensive), a large pizza (again very inexpensive and more than enough for two adults and two kids) and a double Chivas Regal on the rocks which I think was a little over priced and watery. I sure will take my family there for another pizza night but I don't think I will order my favorite drink again."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Atmosphere: Small interior area with 4 tables inside and a few outside. Outdoor seating will be super painful in the heat of the summer. Relatively clean, they have one tv inside. 

Service: Super nice folks behind the counter. They weren't busy so we could take our time. 

Food: Awesome, you can pick your meal, toppings and sides. They seam to have some appetizer type items like Yucca cheese bites. I ordered the chalupa, which came with 3 chalupas. They tasted amazing! My wife ordered a toston. She thought it was great. 

Overall: We will be going back. Give it a try. When we looked it up, there were 50 reviews all 5 stars."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Where to start...

...oh yeah, they make the best sandwiches I ever had! Yummy yummy yummy.

This place is perfect if you want to immerse in the American culture: tavern hidden in the woods  (only known by locals), long line to get your sandwich ticket (that means this place is good), country music bands, Harley-Davidson bikers gathering (and show-off), barbecue smell, beers, leather used biker coats and boots, cowboy hats, thousands pounds of meat, best homemade sauces ever, sunburns, meet-up, hangout, families, happiness... SO CHILL!

I love this place, I've been there twice and I'll go there again.

I was about to forget the tip: this only happens on Sundays so don't go there on Saturdays."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Pucketts is really a great Southern restaurant. You'll get friendly service and so many great food and drink options. My personal favorite meal, so far, is the Smoked Meatloaf. This is not anything like Mama's meatloaf. It is a combo of their brisket and pulled pork. I love that the topping is not too sweet. It's so good... makes it difficult to try other dishes. But, you may also want to try a burger with the pimento cheese....Yum! They have great seasonal cocktails, and my current favorite is the Honey, I'm Home. It tastes like the perfect light summer drink. Their weekend live music is always great as well! Great food, great people!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"These might be the best wings in the city. And I'm a dude who tries to eat wings wherever they serve 'em. The wings here are smoked, not breaded, and HUGE! Ridiculously good. Also had the brisket sandwich, which was absolutely awesome. When we went in, there were only a couple of other customers and it was super laid back. Some people have talked about it being chaotic or full of kids, but I didn't run into that. Also, if that's a problem, you can easily take your order to go. Beer and cocktail list was on point. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for super good BBQ fare off the beaten path."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"On Saturday stopped by drive through was greeted nicely ordered bagel egg bacon combo with hash browns and coffee. Had to pull up in drive through to let other be served while prepared are you kidding me for one bagel geezz. My bagel and coffee was good, but the hash browns they only gave me 4 the bag wasn't even filled up, it's like they didn't have any cook so they just gave me what they had. I bit into one and it was disgusting never had a hash brown so bad in my life. ended up throwing all of them out. Just ate the bagel and coffee will not go back again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great renovation of small building. This is the 3rd seafood purveyor in this location and I'm really grateful that Bevi added more seating! 

I've had a couple of things from here and it's all been tasty. The first time the crawfish were the perfect amount of spice. The 2nd time they were a little to mild for me but it was the first batch of the day. The shrimps have been yummy as have the boil veg.

The staff is really great and Katie can attest that I am WAY too amused by the fact that folks just do not know how to line up when they get busy. Maybe arrows on the floor?"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had an amazing evening at the Bourbon House, and from start to finish it was magnificent! Our drink server Alfred was informative, attentive, and friendly throughout our dinner. Our waiter Marc was so wonderful, professional, and knowledgeable as well. He and Alfred catered to our every need, and really made the evening special. Our Bourbon cocktail was so smooth, and it went perfect our fabulous charbroiled oysters, deep fried jumbo shrimp, and a to die for shrimp/oyster po boy! We finished it off with their delicious chocolate pecan crunch, a fresh fruit cream brûlée, and rich coffee to finish the evening! Thank you for a fabulous dinner, and having such an amazing staff!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The old Kibitz room has a bar and a long bar.

The bar is upstairs and we sat down at the bar. The bartender took our order and our food was ready in 10 minutes.

The food was amazing. The mashed potatoes were very good. The steaks were cooked to perfection.

The service was really good, which was a nice surprise. The food was good, but not great. I liked the atmosphere and the place was pretty busy, but I was definitely expecting more. I would recommend trying it out if you're in the area.I'm very excited to have a new vegan restaurant in Reno! The food was delicious"
Restaurants,1.5,CG,Love BW3's but last night was an exception. We decided to split a salad for the first time. It was delicious. The dressing was a bit too sweet and the greens were very large. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. The dressing was light and creamy. I would definitely recommend this place. We have been going to this place for over a decade. We have tried several different food items on the menu and each time we have enjoyed everything. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always friendly and quick.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Not sure about all the other flavors, but the fried chicken is pretty good. I would recommend.I've had the best experience here.

Restaurants,5.0,CG,"Barrio Bread is SO WONDERFUL. We have been here many times and it's always a delight to go. We always have the best tasting food. The staff is always friendly and always very polite. If you are in the area, try it out. If not, don't miss it!This is a great place for a date night. The food is amazing and the drinks are great. They have live music on Sundays and they have a good selection of wines and beers. The service is great and the food is always delicious."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I will preface this by saying I love the food. I will say that the service was horrible. Our waiter was very attentive but not at all friendly. He didn't take our order or ask if we wanted anything. He took our drink orders for the table and then we had to wait for a server to come to the table. When the waiter came to our table he asked if we wanted any drinks. When I asked for my check he told me he would take it back. We had to wait another 10-15 minutes for a server to come to our
Restaurants,4.5,OR,I asked how much a sauerkraut and mustard hot dog was. She said $3. 99. as I am sitting there I saw a little sign on the table saying Wed thru friday between 3pm and 7pm all hot dogs $2. 00. It was Wed. at 5pm. I asked why isn't my dog $2. 00 and she said because you had a kraut dog. I said are you saying I have to pay $1. 99 for kraut and she said on Tuesday our dogs are $2. 00. I kept asking the question and she wouldn't agree or acknowledge what i was saying. I had the same conversation w/ the cashier. NOT RIGHT. TOTAL RIP OFF.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,So I ordered a cake for my daughters baby shower ( June 30).  I live in Texas but got the recommendation from my sister in law.  Got to store on June 30- no one could find the cake that I ordered or the order.  No owner available to address this.  Girls our writing on smaller cake and assorted me I would get a phone call about this.  Today I got billed for the full price- no phone call beforehand either.  I call and am told no one can help me until July 12 as they still can't find my order-YET THEY COULD FIND IT TO BILL ME!!! Ug!!!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Came here for Valentine's Day and loved it! The service was great and we had no problems. We both ordered off their special menu. I had their Caesar salad and he ordered the lobster bisque. It went great with the complimentary bread they serve. I had the New York strip steak and baked potato. I also tried their Gorgonzola butter for the steak but it was too strong for my liking. My boyfriend ordered the ribeye and Brussel sprouts. We shared sides and both steaks were excellent. For dessert we got the chocolate meltdown. It was very fun to watch as they serve it in front of you. Overall it was a great meal!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Need a bite to eat during your lunch hour and only have about $10 to spare? Choose this place!
Their party wings, fries and fried okra are to die for! The sauces are tasty no matter which I choose. You can call ahead and your order will be done by the time you get there. I only give this place 4/5 stars because I feel the customer service can be way better. The gentleman at the register is always kind, but the lady can use some work. She is short and unpleasant. If you can look past this, you should check this place out! I try to go at least once every couple of weeks!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Boyfriend and I walked all the way from the business district to get here for some delicious BBQ. After walking through the changing neighborhoods and being greeted by the sign outside I felt doubtful. Then you go in, and the smell cures you! My goodness was the sausage and pulled pork good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it with the sauces. And the mac and cheese! Geez if only I could get this in nyc. Also try the pb pie! We were stuffed but inhaled that thing like crack!
Also cool to know theres outside seating and you can see their smoker. Boyfriend told me he saw someone chopping up wood. Very neat."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Located in a convenient plaza in king of Prussia. Walked in without a reservation twice and both times only waited by the bar for about 15 minutes max (this is during dinner hour) which was impressive. They have a strawberry infused martini there which I loved. I am a big fan of fruity drinks. It's not overly sweet though. The have a pretty extensive menu, lots of options to chose from. I had the pork chop which was just ok. The side options are boring and dessert was just mediocre. Overall it's a nice restaurant in a good location but no wow factor. Try the one in center city. I like that one better"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Unfortunately I have to give a 2 star review. The food here is actually quite good but the service has been quite bad. I have had dinner here 2 times, both on a Monday evening, and it takes extended periods of time 20-30 min to receive even just for water and wine. Our servers both times were inattentive and gave poor service but our server Britany was rude to our table for no reason, on every occasion she came to the table.  Its unfortunate because clearly other people are working hard at the bar, sushi bar, and kitchen but with 2 experiences of the worst service I've ever had I won't be returning."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The Ceviche was 5 star! 6 or 7 flavor options with multiple seafood choices and the sampler platter (you pick 4) was a beautiful presentation, huge portions and some of the best I have ever had and there are two Miami restaurants competing for my palate when it comes to ceviche.
My friends filet burrito I think it was called was excellent, very tender well flavored beef, not your typical burrito. The only reason it was not a total 5 star is that although my tacos were good the steak taco was a little bland and the soft shells were corn and I tend to like the wheat personally.
Great ambience, server very nice, hostesses disinterested."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"For the dollar amount of $8 you get, you're better off going to the local one. I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked to order and the chorizo was very flavorful. My boyfriend had the chicken burrito with no chips. He liked it and I liked mine. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The burrito was very filling and filling. The burrito was filling and flavorful. The chorizo was very filling and flavorful. The burrito was very filling and flavorful."

If you're looking for a good spot for a good meal, you'll be disappointed.I'm so excited to have found a good Thai place in the area. This is my first time here and I was looking forward to trying the curry and the curry chicken. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the chicken curry and it was extremely greasy and tasted like it came from a can. The chicken was very dry and had no flavor. The curry tasted like it had been sitting out"
Restaurants,1.5,CG,"Yet another terrible fast food experience. The food was just ok. The pulled pork sandwich was just ok. The mac and cheese was alright. The fried chicken was okay. The fries were ok. The only thing I'd give 4 stars was the customer service.I've been coming here for years.  I have to say it's by far the best Chinese food I've had in a while.  I've tried a few items on their menu and all have been very good.  The spicy wings are my favorite, they are a little too spicy for my taste."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,3 stars only because our server was so rude and just wasn't around for a long time. The other two employees had a lot of attitude and attitude as well. I won't be back. I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken burrito and said it was pretty good. I had the pork taco which was good but nothing special. I will say the service was very good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd definitely go back for lunch again. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food was ok, kinda pricey. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the service. The waitress was super friendly and the food was good but the service was sooooo slow it was impossible to get her attention. She took forever to get our water and our food. The manager also seemed a bit annoyed with us and did not want to be there. I think the manager could have been a little more attentive and more professional. Maybe they didn't have a good day for her.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My friend and I came here to check out the happy hour and we were not disappointed.
For a Friday afternoon it was the perfect amount of crowded but the two of us were still able to be seated within 10 minutes. We initially sat inside but it was very loud so we switched to the outdoor patio seating for the perfect late afternoon state street atmosphere. 
The happy hour menu is great. We ordered the margherita pizza which came in a shareable size and the mozzarella was fresh- no complaints. The fried pickles were a-ok, the batter is very thick and has a corn meal texture.  

Overall, I'd recommend Finney's for solid happy hour!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I'm really tempted to write a bad review! I'd hate to see this place overrun. But I'll stick to the truth. Nori Thai is fabulous! It's not a fancy place but rather casual. Cozy enough though. And the food!! Delicious! Been going there for years and it never disappoints. Just tonight I ordered the red chicken curry and spring rolls to go. I opened up the containers and it looks like a double portion of everything. The curry is outstanding and the spring rolls huge! Not like some scrawny little rolls you get at other Thai restaurants. Sushi is great there as well! Can't help but recommend if you're in the mood for Thai food!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The shrimp gumbo, chicken gumbo, biscuit, and greens were all perfect. I'm just visiting Nola but I kept going to this place back to back. The coffee is not impressive, definitely not a place to expect something better than basic diner coffee. Still it's a no brainer why this place is so famous. Just about every item is rich in flavor and perfect, reminds you of home cooking. The interior is not preference, I understand the charm in its unchanged decor but there is no need for the lack of modernization, it looks a little run down, I think it's  trying to hard to feel like a people champ, a working mans resting grounds."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm not a vegan and my husband is quite the carnivore. But with such high ratings, we were intrigued enough to check this place out after a morning of paddle boarding. We got the umami mushroom burger and empanadas. Both were filling and very flavorful. I liked the portion sizes which weren't enormous but satisfying. But the true star of the meal was our dessert, baklava with soy vanilla ice cream. Ahhh so tasty!!! I hadn't had baklava in over a year and I had forgotten how good it could be. And the ice cream so was creamy I was convinced it couldn't be vegan. Service was quick and friendly. I'd definitely come back again!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The atmosphere is lacking, I know the Gulch has a whole renovated warehouse vibe going, but the concrete floors and building support columns just do not hold up to a $90 dinner for one that consisted of a cocktail, appetizer, and entree.  The service was average and the crawfish stuffed flounder was excellent.  The other person in my party had oysters and things did not go to well for them for the next 24 hours, but that is the main reason I do not eat oysters. There are better options in Nashville to chose from when spending more than $50 on a meal, so it is doubtful there will be a return visit."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had a great meal with very service on a slow weekday night - no wait.  The catfish and ribs combo was my choice and I really enjoyed it.  Lots of choices for sides, but the fries, beans, and onion rings were quite good.  Our server was polite and helpful.  

There is an awesome old Dodge Ram truck as part of the decor.  Yes, there are lots of stuffed animals, but some live catfish swimming in an indoor pond too.

I will be a regular at this place and will recommend to my friends.  The photos already posted give you a pretty good idea of the place.  Check it out."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"I think her name is Kaitlyn, but she is amazing! Every time we come here I get a receipt so I can write a great review on her service, but always manage to forget to do it until Monday when it is expired. We sit at the bar every single time and get exceptional service. She remembered us the second time we went! The food is always what you expect it to be for being a chain restaurant. The buffalo boneless wings are my absolute go-to, I also really enjoy their French Onion Soup. Their appetizers are always great and you can get them half off during happy hour too. THANK YOU FOR AMAZING SERVICE!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This place is awesome we go here every time we are in town. The staff is awesome and the atmosphere is great. The food is delicious and the drinks are great.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We were excited about this dinner as we typically have a good experience in Syrian restaurants. Sadly it was an example that many high reviews can still be a wrong indication of the quality of food and service.
While the service was ok, it lacked smiling from the entrance, through the meal till the exit.
While the prices were not high as the California the quality of the food was average at best.
The Mijadara was the best thing we got, everything else from lamb kifta, chicken shawarma, cauliflower, salad, etc were barely ok.
The worst thing we got was the orange juice, I could not tel if it was fresh or not just because it was so watered downed."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I come here probably twice a week because the sushi is so good. The service has always been hit or miss but I always come back for the food. Today I was eating edamame and a maggot popped out of it which is totally disgusting but I understand that these things happen. I showed our server and all she could say was that it's probably organic and that's how it got in there. We got our check and she hadn't taken the edamame off which I thought was rude since they were infested with maggots and I didn't consume the rest of it. I love Sakanas but they really need to work on their customer service.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Its a diner and certainly not a good one.  Its cheap, the food clearly comes out of boxes, cans and bags... every single item we ordered looked like someone didn't just microwave it and put it on a plate.  The salad bar is cheap... iceberg lettuce, minimal fresh vegetables, mayo based salads and dressings and imitation bacon bits.  The soup was just re-heated from some restuarant supply company and dinner was basic hospital food.  The place is however packed - they have a very active senior crowd - I am guessing this is how they stay in business... if they don't start to think fresh eventually they won't have any customers left."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went last night in a big group - I really liked it, but I wanted to share our experience because no one liked the entree crepe (with crabmeat and spinach).  Everyone that got a crepe as an entree coincidentally ordered the crabmeat/spinach one, and people were upset that it was too heavy, too mushy, no texture.

however, the ones of us who ordered non-crepes for an entree (mussels/frites; steak/frites), loved it!  Also, the appetizers (seafood cheese dip, fondue, french onion soup, salad tropicale) were AMAZING!  

Finally, the dessert crepes were out of this world!  
And, for a big group they were very accommodating - it helped that we went on a Tuesday."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Really beautiful and special restaurant. Love the ambience and the décor is really something! I've been here for both lunch and dinner and I have always been greeted so warmly by the hostess and waiters. When I was here for the first time the waiter really took the time to explain the menu to me and go over some of the best items. The ceasar salad is a great starter! Probably the best ceasar I have ever had. The dressing is super savory.
I went with the sea bass for lunch which was light and melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious! My friend had the cashew chicken which he really enjoyed. Can't wait to come back and try more menu items!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love this place. You've heard of Cheers. Where everybody knows your name. ... 


If you don't know someone here, you will, or should. 
Welcoming all, you'll find a variety from the colorful 'weird' to the family.
Great people, good staples. Not a huge menu, but good, and a great way to start, chill, or finish your day since it's open early and late. 

Always a good selection of art, and if you forget your computer and gotta check in, they have a couple computers for you to use at a good price. 
Check out the door for local postings too

Go because its layed back, friendly, one stop shop, and great any time
Its not plush and polished"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great breakfast, very organized, large portions, fresh food.  Don't let the crowds waiting scare you away.  There will likely be a wait on a weekend but you can do a call ahead and they turn tables pretty quickly.  The food was delicious- I went with a party of 5 and everyone enjoyed their breakfast.  The side of fruit is gigantic and a great variety.  I had the corned beef hash, eggs, toast breakfast.  I also got grits and home fries.  It tasted wonderful.  Great prices for the portion sizes but keep in mind they don't allow sharing!  I would definitely go back to try other menu items."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is beautiful, the staff are professional & friendly, the food is good. I'd say it's dependable. Which is great when you've got a good thing going! The mimosas, tomato artichoke soup, chicken salad sandwich on sourdough & chips were fantastic. I'll be back for the soup alone. My husband wasn't thrilled with the salad-the vinaigrette was coated on everything but it didn't always have a flavor, it's very odd. We'll give it many other chances though-my husband can't wait to try an omelet & I can't wait to eat more soup! And more chicken salad! They even offer larger sizes of certain items to take home-I wish I'd gotten chicken salad & soup today!"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"The place is just what you'd expect for a chain restaurant. 

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty.  I've had the ribs and ribs and both were quite dry.  I'd come back for the ribs.  

The service is great.  The food is good.  The prices are great.  I would recommend to anyone.  I'm not sure I'd go back, but if you want to try different dishes, the menu is a little limited.This place was great! We"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Love this place and the food is amazing!! We love the cold weather and the variety of beers. We always have the best time, and the staff is always friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table, especially when it is very busy. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the lamb gyro and it was excellent. I also had the chicken tikka masala which was delicious. The portion size was perfect and the price was right. I would highly recommend the tikka masala."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Oh my gosh....what a dump. We had the crab cakes which were cold and doughy. The crab cakes were so small that they didn't even have crab meat. The crab cakes were so thick that they had no flavor. The crab meat was absolutely tasteless and mushy. The sauce was cold and tasted like a watered down tomato sauce. 

I would definitely come back here. I just wish there was more flavor to it. The service was excellent.This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese.  It was very good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The service was terrible. Felt like a professional server. Not sure if they need a new chef or just a new manager. The food was mediocre at best. Tried the pork chop and the seafood gumbo. It was bland and not worth the money. This is my new favorite restaurant.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the chef's special, the pork chop with ham and the cajun fries. The food was delicious and the portions were generous. The menu has a variety of appetizers, dinner and"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Horrible horrible service. We understand that it's busy, but we were seated at a table and the servers were so rude. The food was mediocre at best, and the server was very rude. She seemed confused when we asked if she could bring us some water and water glasses. The manager also seemed a bit annoyed with us and did not want to be there. I think the manager could have been a little more attentive and understanding. We were on a road trip and needed a quick lunch before heading to the airport. The location is great, but the service was awful."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"A wonderful, surprisingly delicious evening!
Chad was an amazing server and a great manager. We will definitely be back. Great food and great service. The salad bar is a great touch. If you like fresh squeezed lemonade, you will love this place. I ordered the churros and they were excellent. I also ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was delicious!  The salmon was cooked perfectly and it was cooked perfectly. We also had the ginger sauce and it was so yummy."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We were greeted by a friendly staff and greeted by a knowledgeable manager. The food was delicious and we will be back. The staff was very friendly and provided a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. I absolutely love this place! I ordered the chorizo tacos. They were so good! I can't wait to go back!I really love this place. It's right next to the Sears and on the way to a hotel, so if you want to get into the shopping center, you will have to get there early."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Perfect for people who:

Eat healthy and clean
Don't have time to cook
Want something tasty
Have any size family (I use it just for my husband and I)! 

Pros:

Clean inside
Nice people
Food tastes good
They have a microwave so you can eat in store
Easy and convenient if I'm on that side of town
Great concept - you go inside and there is a large freezer with all different types of healthy prepared meals. 
Organized well inside
I like how they have options in different sizes (for different sized families)
They use BPA free containers
They have 57 different item menus and they change 2-3 items a month! 
I heard the new cookie is AMAZING

Qualms:
More vegetarian/vegan options - although they just updated the menu and added more!!!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside or the inside- but push past that and you're in for a treat!! We tried the sample platter for 1-2 with three meats, two sides, slaw, pickles and bread. We split this all three ways so we'd have room for dessert. The pork was moist and delicious, the brisket was perfectly cooked, and the sausage was full of garlicky deliciousness! We sampled  the sauces- Ol' Yeller, jerk, and Red Hog, but didn't try the Fu Man sauce because we are weenies. The sauces we did try were all so good! 
This is a great small town pick and I highly recommend you make a trip to McCordsville!!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"While visiting Philly for work, I visited this location at least 10 times and found the internet to be unreliable 80% of the time.

Staff is nice and you can work there for hours if you're reading a book or writing a paper. For those of us who are consultants requiring basic internet- it's impossible to work there. Based on other Yelp reviews, this has been a problem for years. Management is celebrating their 10th anniversary- why not celebrate by purchasing""real"" bandwidth and wi-fi equipment.?

Wobbly tables and crazy drunk men from the bar across the street bang on the windows soliciting change (Omar actually has a Yelp page) make this neighborhood coffee shop a unique West Philly experience."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I see the potential here. But this place is very crowded, loud, and the staff doesn't seem like they can handle it once it gets busy. Waited for a table for outside, took 10 minutes to get a bartender's attention, BUT food did not take very long. The alcohol prices didn't match what was on my check. The menu prices were $1-$2 off. They tried to charge me extra ""just because that's how someone put it in the system"". For real! Waiters are nice, kept checking on us, but kept having to make excuses for things honestly out of their control. Wouldn't recommend to locals, it's a hotel tourist place. Go on a Monday night or something..."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The food is truly horrible. As an Asian person from the Bay Area this food is absolutely atrocious and putrid. The falafel seems frozen from Walmart and somehow they managed to absolutely butcher hummus??? Hummus! It was so awful I couldn't bear the taste. The platter was also so small and all it had was a little rice, some falafel, an unseasoned piece of potato, some tomato cucumber salad, and yogurt that curdled before we even got home. The platter was also $12 a pop which is absurd and unruly pricing for the absolute garbage quality that this food is. I hope this restaurant shuts down and never opens again. I've had better Mediterranean food in Utah"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Ok we increased the difficulty level and wow did Benedetto's come through with flying colors. We arrived as a group of 6 to celebrate my father in laws birthday. The first thing to highlight is Amanda, from the moment we walked in and throughout dinner her energy, bright smile and amazing service helped us make a memory. Our various dishes (special mention to the veal rack) were served together hot delicious and and everything we hoped for. Chef Ben's upbeat visit (we tried to get Amanda promoted) gives such a special attention to his guests. The ambiance (rat pack, piano player, amazing art and memorabilia) is fantastic. Come to Benedetto's for a special evening and great dinner!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Had the turkey dinner and my mom had a bagel toasted with butter. They were both bad. The turkey was dry and tasted old, the stuffing tastes exactly like stove top and it was all covered in what looked and tasted like gravy from a can. Not good. The bagel might have been good but it wasn't toasted enough and covered in tasteless margarine yuck. 
I was also hoping they would have some decent desert selections but the cakes and pies in the case weren't very appealing.

The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is the place was clean and the waitress was really nice. Unfortunately that isn't enough for me to ever go back."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I'm always on the lookout for new restaurants with good food.

The reason I'm giving this place two stars is because I am a huge fan of the chicken salad. I've been to many other restaurants and this one is a bit different. I really enjoy the chicken salad. I love it. I also love the fact that they serve a lot of it. It's great. I just wish there was more chicken. But that's just me. It's very good.

I've also tried their baked potato. It's great. I haven't had it in"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Came here because we had a craving for a quick bite to eat. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, and the portions were very generous. The only downside was that the parking lot was a bit on the narrow side.I really enjoy this place. The decor is a bit old-school and it's a bit loud. But I think the food is good and the drinks are amazing. I usually go for the seafood platter with the crab cakes. The shrimp and grits is a must try. You can't go wrong with the coffee!I"

The food is good. 

If you're looking for some good food, this is the place to go.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Stumbled upon this place.  We had the crab cakes and the shrimp and grits.  Both were delicious.   The crab cake was good but the grits were a little over cooked.   

We got a coffee and some water and it was great.  I had a glass of wine and the flavor was good.  

Service was great.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  We will definitely be back!I'm very excited to have a new Chinese restaurant in Reno! The food was really good and the service was great!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I had jury duty this weekend and I was very disappointed. The waitress was very rude. I had to ask for a soda and the manager never came to check on me. The food was good, but nothing special. I had the short rib with turkey. It was very good and the flavor was great. The service was really bad. I had to ask for my drink refilled twice. The prices are very high for what you get. I'd give it a 4, but I won't go back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I was an oyster virgin and it was the best part of the meal! The oysters were cooked perfectly and the flavor was spot on. The salad was tasty and the creamed spinach was a great side. The service was good and the food was good. The only thing I would say is that the oysters are a bit over priced for what you get. I would say if you want to try a new restaurant you will be happy with the experience. Overall it was a great experience and the price is a little high for what you get.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The dinner got off to a slow start with the waiter saying it was my birthday and I ordered the gnocchi. The gnocchi was crispy, seasoned well and was very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size of the gnocchi and the excellent service. The restaurant is a bit small but I will return. I had the crab cake with a side of pastries and my husband had the pork chop with ham and bacon. I thought the pastries were better than the pastries, but I'd be willing to try the pork chop again."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"So many amazing, sexy dishes that it's going to be hard for me to go through each one. My recommendation would be to try as many things as you can and don't skip the fried whole fish. That's a treat! Of course I had to try the two handed chicken sandwich on my second visit and it truly does live up to its reputation. It's one of the most flavorful sandwiches I've ever eaten! We loved the specialty cocktails. Loved the desserts, especially the Key Lime pie. What I adore most
 about Sea Worthy is that you can go there for an elegant dinner or an after boating meal that's simple and delicious. Both would be equally memorable!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"South Ocean's website is most definitely deceiving.  It gives the impression of a lush Asian Experience.

Reality is much different than the Matrix...

I would call this dive sushi in a Chandler-esque manner.  This place is not for the faint of heart...or even the local food inspector.

While the Lexis Roll really is a fantastic creation (tuna, salmon, avocado, spicy sauce and an exotic presentation, the rest of the really sushi is just passable...if you can't get sushi anywhere else.

The staff is courteous.  The clientele is amusing.  Don't come for the sushi.

I'm still on the hunt for good sushi in suburban Philly.  I may have to break down and actually head into the City.

More to follow..."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"We've been ordering from here for many years.  Our favorite chinese was House of Chen, but they closed.  We would order from here when we didn't feel like trucking over to china town.  After House of Chen closed we tried MANY places and still find this to be the next best.  The #1 reason is the dumplings.  They have the very thin dough that few places seem to use.   I won't give it 5 stars because a few times the flavor was off and can't say that it was 100% as fresh as other times.  Yet all in all some very good chinese at very good prices with quick delivery."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Forgot to do my check-in and review back on 7/13.
Finally had a chance to check this place out after procrastinating and saying I'll try it soon. 
I decided since it w my first time, I was going to indulge and indulge I did. 
I decided to get their daily special which was the Caribbean Chicken Sammy but added as 8 egg to it. It paid off!! Grabbed some fries because that day happened to be National French Fries Day and finished it off by getting their shake of the day which was the Peanut Butter Cookie shake. 
Can't wait to return (which will be today to do take out so I'll have something delish to eat at work)."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Ordered the Italian Stallion here for lunch. The sandwich itself tasted very good, lots of powerful flavors and you can tell the meats, bread, and provolone are high quality. It was just unfortunately really stingy on all of that, almost laughably small portions :/ It felt like I was eating a bread sandwich at times--it had maybe one slice each of salami and coppa, and probably less than a slice of cheese. Maybe I got a bad one but there were bites where all I ate were bread and the aioli spread. The pepper shooters side was also just one pepper... 

Good taste, the ingredients are high quality, but the portion leaves *a lot* to be desired, sadly."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"After searching various food blogs and write ups about food in new Orleans, I made it a point to try out the classic po boy at mothers.

Upon ordering it seemed a little pricey coming out to about $14 for a single po boy but this could have probably fed 2 really hungry people. It was really two meals in one. I really enjoyed the flavors of the po boy but I would request extra pickles next time because they add a good flavor to the dish. Also the only reason this isn't getting five stars is because the po boy hoagie was a little soggy on the bottom because of all the juices, but overall a tasty dish."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I can still taste the stuffed mirliton that my husband had for lunch.  It was so good and I want more!!  I had the crawfish étouffée.  It was really good as well with a good dark roux.  The cocktails were good as well.  I will definitely come back the next time I'm in NOLA.  

The service was also very good and we did not feel rushed with it being a later lunch.

If you want to sit on the balcony, that has a great view a Jackson Square, it is drinks only.  Drab a good cocktail from the bar in the back and head upstairs.  Really great for nice spring day!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at the restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Our server, Jessica, was fantastic!  She was great, attentive and helpful. We ordered a few appetizers:  the crab cake and the fried shrimp. The crab cake was wonderful, but the shrimp was a bit too salty for me. My husband had the fried shrimp and it was really good. We also had the fried chicken and it was also very good. The fried chicken was very tender and flavorful."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,A perfect location to have a drink and an appetizer. The ambiance is awesome. It's not the best but it's definitely not the worst. It's definitely not the best place to have a drink at a bar. There are a few other places you can have a drink at. The food is also good. There's a lot of options for all kinds of food. I tried the chicken fajitas. It was very flavorful and very moist. The shrimp tacos were also very good. The hibiscus wings were also good.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"My new favourite sushi place! We have been going here for years and love it every time! We always get the tuna rolls and the miso soup and the Tuna melt is amazing! We go here everyday and we will be back!I absolutely love this place! I ordered the chinese fried rice with sweet potato fries and it was amazing. The service was great and the food was delicious! My boyfriend got the pork belly bbq. It was so flavorful and very moist. The only thing I would change is the fried rice would be a little more spicy, but it was still"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Well we waited a long time for our food and it was cold. When we got home the food was so cold we couldn't eat it. The salad was okay. The creamed spinach was good. The bread was good. The mashed potatoes were OK. I ordered the turkey with turkey. It was very good and the flavor was good. The gravy was ok. I also ordered a cheese steak. It was not as good as the one I ordered at the other location. The turkey was very good. The gravy was good. I will definitely not order again.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Walked around the Reading Terminal Market on the weekend and decided to try this place out. We ordered the chicken sandwiches and the fries. The sandwiches were delicious! The chicken was juicy and the fries were crispy and crunchy. The sandwich was huge and the fries were huge! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!One of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time! I will say the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only reason I gave a star is because the service was very slow. It took forever for my food to come out and it was not hot.
Restaurants,5.0,CG,"This is a spot that I will visit again and again.

The ambiance is awesome. It's not the best but it's good. The service is good too.I'm so excited to come here!

Restaurants,4.0,CG,They have a drink menu that has a wide variety. I had a bottle of the local beer. It was delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was great. The burgers were good. The fries were good. The coffee was good. I will be back. I love this place. I have been going here for a year and have been to a lot of great places in the city. The food is always great and the service is excellent. I love the service here and have never had a bad meal. The food is always good and the prices are reasonable.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We have eaten here three times since it has opened. The first time we went was on opening day. We had no idea until we asked that it was the first day they were open for business. The service was a bit scattered and a couple of things could have been better on that visit. When we came back they had all of the kinks worked out. The pho is solid, the fried rice flavorful, the bun is garlicy and delicious and the sushi is very good and reasonably priced. The specialty rolls are much cheaper than you would see other places. I keep wanting to go back to try something new because each menu item has been great."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"It was our first time and all I can say is wow!! We joined just in time for the lunch specials and the portions were pretty big! Great for the price range! We had the spicy pork bulgogi, marinated pork belly, and marinated beef bulgogi with sides. It was to die for! They were out of fried calamari, so we opted for the chicken wings instead. Best decision ever! The wings were a nice size considering it was an appetizer. They were fried in a light batter and tossed in a sweet & spicy glaze. So glad our waitress, Hanna, recommended them! We wish we could come here every week! Definitely one of our stops when we visit NOLA!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I went to Caney Fork before a show at the Grand Ole Opry. The service was great: they knew we had a show to catch and our server, Chris, was very accommodating.

The corn fritters (free before the meal comes out) were out of this world. So addicting and delicious. 

The food itself was also very good. The blackened catfish was well seasoned. The sampler platter (fried catfish, beer battered cod, fried shrimp, frogs legs, etc) was amazing and could easily feed 2. I usually don't like fish and chips, but that cod was amazing. 

This place basically feels like an all-you-can-eat buffet with their portion sizes. Except the quality is great! I recommend eating here, especially if you're starving!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I read the Yelp reviews of Monkey Burger and decided to give it a shot. In my opinion, it is better than ZinBurger or any of the chains in town. I guess I would have to say that it's now my go-to place when I crave a burger, although it wasn't perfect. I got the All-American cooked medium with fries. It was cooked perfectly and had above average flavor, but it was just a little greasy. Some will like that, but I don't. The fries were above average as well and they were plentiful. The decor and atmosphere were nothing special, but that won't keep me from going back. I'm happy to have another place in my restaurant rotation."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The biryani and dum biryani were so good, we have to come back often for some Indian food. Every time we went there, we ordered chicken or goat biryani. This time an Indian friend visiting Reno for the first time, and he recommended us with a few dishes we have never ordered, and they were good too. A few perks of having an Indian friend. =)

He ordered mutton sukka (a boneless goat/sheep meat)...sooooo delicious, but a bit too spicy to eat by itself, but if eat with phulka or naan it any of the Indian bread, the spice level will go down a notch.

Then finally for dessert, we ordered mango lassi, and falooda. Our overall experience, one word: Yummy!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Our first time here we were hungover and excited to come back! While the food took a long time, the restaurant was busy and the server was attentive. Yesterday we gave it another shot and everything was covered in grease!!
My daughter wouldn't even touch the kids Mac & Cheese and after a few bites myself, I started feeling sick. The fried cauliflower was drenched in grease as well as the nachos. My husband took 1 bite of his burger but couldn't even stomach that. I came home, re-heated the mac and cheese and all the butter and oil came to the top. I rolled it around in paper towels and completely drenched 3 paper towels in grease."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We got there at 7:15 and waited in line until after 8.  They had someone come out and say slow down the line because the kitchen was so far behind.  Once we were inside, we waited forever to get waited on and saw others that came in after us get waited on.  We waited inside for 45 minutes before being waited on and a waitress told us another waiter didn't realize we were his table. The oysters were good, although they were out of the ones we wanted, and the red beans and rice were cold and not as good as what we'd had earlier in the day elsewhere.   Definitely not what we expected."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Been here a number of times and the food is consistently good. 

The only downfall is that the service is a bit slow.  The server was not attentive at all and was just a little overwhelmed. 

I think it's going to be a while before I return and I'd like to give them another try. 

I'd definitely come back.We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed.  I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the salmon salad.  Both were very good and our server was very nice. "
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food is AMAZING. Someone else has mentioned the food is GREAT. The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The fries are thick, not crispy. It's a fryer. There are fries with extra cheese. The fries are always a bit soggy and soggy. The fries are always soggy. They are always soggy. I can't tell you how many times I have been here. The fries are always soggy. The fries are always soggy."

Both were excellent. The pizza was very large. My salad was excellent. The chicken salad was a bit too spicy. I did not feel the chicken was flavorful. My salad was also very good.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Love. Love. Love the food here. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the service is terrible. The servers are always so rude and get the food wrong.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I order food a lot.  I have been noticing this place for quite a while. The pictures look good with all the veggies and the egg. Finally decided to order the beef teriyaki. What we got was the rice, Beef, teriyaki sauce on the side, Lots of onions, Lettuce,  and rice.  We did not get all the nice veggies that is in the pictures showed, Which is why this is only 3 stars. It was very tasty. We had the pot stickers as well, And those were delicious. It also came with a soup. I liked it but my wife did not. Without the other vegetables, I don't know if I will order from this place again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is the best diner to hit this area since Dynasty went out of business. It is super clean, and the staff is always friendly while providing superior service. Breakfast food is great and reasonable, no matter what time of day you order it. There are some amazing dinner deals, too. We were sad when the recently removed the mini meals from the menu, but the waitress informed us they are under the senior meals and anyone can order them. Our favorite is the crab cakes or crab-stuffed shrimp, which are huge portions that come with a side, salad(they have the BEST Caesar salad) and pudding or jello for dessert. This diner is consistent and is our favorite family restaurant!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'm not a huge pizza lover (like my bf haha), and I'm not a huge fan of wood oven pizza since they are kind of thin and usually kind of soggy, BUT this place is awesome! All 3 times I've gone, I've been super impressed with their pizza... definitely my favorite in Tucson so far and I've been to quite a few (hence the bf).

Decor is nice as well and it's a pretty neat concept with all the different seating areas and extra bars. I've heard they use original recipes to make cocktails (at least in the underground bar or whatever they call it)...I'm not so much a cocktail drinker, but they have a nice beer and wine selection too."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've been here a few times and every time it's great. As a vegetarian, there is a limited menu however they always have one veggie taco to choose as well as some great sides. I have gone with meat eaters who have been blown away by the tres hermanos burrito as well as the carne asada tacos. Also, their salsas are amazing (some are very hot but the menu lets you know the spice level) and the tostadas they serve with it are so freakin' good! Their happy hour is nice an you can get half off the salsa trio as well as deals on the house margarita and some beers. One of the best Mexican restaurants in the city!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"had an amazing dinner last night for my birthday- although they knew about that- no one offered anything special for it- loved the warm buns- a little later another couple of buns came but were quite cold so not nearly as nice- the lobster bisque was absolutely superb- my husband did not like the seafood chowder very much- the calamari and prawns were well seasoned but extremely chewy- we sent most of it back- we had to ask for more water, for pepper and for knives- our waiter was not amazingly attentive- the rack of lamb was likely the best that I have ever had but at 48.00- extremely expensive- not sure if we will go back or not yet"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Positives: the location and outside patio area are nice. Food wise, the broth was flavorful and the pork shoulder was pretty delicious, but the positives stop there. I got the black garlic ramen and my girlfriend got the spicy ""red ramen."" I tasted very little garlic and her soup was basically just flavored with sriracha chili paste. The soup was oily and lacked that authentic ramen taste. The noodles might as well have been microwaved top ramen noodles. They were chewy and slimy and had very little flavor. Overall it was quite a disappointing bowl of ramen. But! If you're looking for like 3 little bites of really tender and delicious pork shoulder for 15 bucks. This is your place."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We came for brunch on Sunday, looking for a place that still serves in the early afternoon.  First impression was great, but after being seated the fiasco began.  Because of all the positive reviews I'm guessing we got there near the end of the shift, the chef had left along with all the responsible people.  The waitress was in training, we asked for water three times and finally got up and got it ourselves.  When the food came it was sub-par, the escargot were overcooked and the moules frites were undercooked.  We also ordered a salad which was mediocre at best. Better to stick to dinner perhaps.  We won't waste our money there again."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"First of all: there is a bar and a long bar for all ages, and the bar has a nice atmosphere.  The food is delicious and the drinks are tasty.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This was a stop for us on our way to Reno for a work trip. I was pretty impressed with the food. The Chicken wings were good but the flavor was a bit off. The burger was okay. It was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I did get the sweet potato fries and they were tasty. They were a bit over cooked but not bad. The service was good. We will definitely be back.We had a party of 6 and the service was absolutely awful. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table"

The food was good.  The drinks were good, but the food was not great.  I had the seafood gumbo and it was good, but nothing special.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was good but nothing to write home about.  My date had the crab cake and she liked it but she liked it a lot more. 

The prices are very reasonable.  The portions are huge.  The service is friendly.  They also have a great happy hour menu.

The server was nice and attentive. I will be back. I'm always a fan of this place!  I'm not sure if it's a new owner or just a new staff, but I love the atmosphere and the food. It's very fun to watch the chefs work together and make the food. I love that they have a great beer selection."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The food was absolutely amazing. I got the roasted snow crab legs and shared with my girlfriend and still had some leftovers. My friend got the fish and chips and it came with so much food. The only complaint I have had to be the service. The host that initially sat us down was so nice. But our waiter messed up our order which happens sometimes no big deal. Our appetizers came out after our food. One of the appetizers was wrong and when we told him he told us we never said that and basically you get what you get. We ended up paying for an appetizer we didn't want in the first place and that no one really ate.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My husband and I were on a little getaway found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it out. We went 2-28-2021 a Sunday at 11:30 it was busy but we got a table 15 minutes later. Cute homey atmosphere! A lot of locals so you know it's a great brunch place. I got Lox platter which had Salmon, Cream cheese, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, capers with an everything bagel toasted and a side of fresh strawberries yum! My husband had the chose 2-2-2, 2 eggs, 2 pancakes with fresh strawberries/bananas and 2 pieces of crispy bacon. Yummy!!! Great service, great atmosphere and delish yummy homemade brunch. They also have a variety of lunch foods. Definitely will be back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,We bookmarked this place a while back but was in the area and search came up again and decided to try.  The outside was not what was expected since we were looking for a restaurant.  The outside looks like a museum gift shop.  We went in and ordered from a simple menu but complex tea and coffee menu.  Everything was good and the pastry was up to my Parisian husband's liking.  I was a bit weird out with the plastic and disposable plates and utensils.  I guess that's the new thing.  I just prefer in real silverware and real plates and bowls.  Anyway it was good food but the presentation could be better.
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"I wanted to try this place for a while and finally got the chance today. I got the Iskender Kabab platter and my sister got the beef gyro platter. The beef gyro platter was really delicious but I think it would be better if there was more sauce included, the cup of sauce was kind of small. We especially enjoyed the salad in the beef gyro platter, it was so fresh! The iskender platter was good but the tomato sauce needed more flavor, and the platter needed some kind of salad to give a balance to the fatty meat. Overall, both platters were pretty good, but I personally would get the beef gyro platter instead of the iskender platter next time."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This was my first time in Reno and staying overnight here. Silver Legacy has a Victorian theme... so kind of a vintage feel.

As for the room, we stayed in a two bed room... the size was decent.. came with a TV and that's about it. No iron or hair dryer so bring your own (unlike other hotels where these things are standard). Beds are ok. The room felt really humid though so we had to keep the fan on the whole time... the room smelled like a smoking room although we were told it was non-smoking.

Everything was clean though... and the hotel placement is nice since it's connected to Circus Circus and El Dorado... so you don't have to wander outside."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"My friend and I went to take out lunch,  She said it was the best Thai Food in Edmonton.  Then we were informed that they changed owners.  The restaurant was empty at lunch hour which should have been the first warning as it is located in a fairly busy part of town where I would think they would do really good business at lunch.  The prices were so high but we were still optimistic it would be really good.  It sucked.  I got the panang curry and it looked so watered down and the portions were so small.  My friend got the mango salad and it was mostly carrots.  Would never go back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Oh my gosh, this is the best service we have had from any waiter in NOLA or anywhere for that matter. He was amazing and went above his normal duties to make us happy and feel welcomed. The manager was also very nice. The service was very fast. We all got different food, 1 breakfast, 1 sandwich plate, and 1 shrimp dinner, and it was so fast coming out. The kitchen staff is awesome too as all the food was delicious and fresh tasting. Probably one of the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had. Good view of Decatur St and Jackson square while we ate as well. We will definitely be going back on our next trip to NOLA!"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"To just be seated it took an hour to get our food. When we got our food we were given a very small plate of fries and then the manager came to take our order. When we told him we were in a hurry he told us he would take our order. We were told we could just order online and then they would call us back to check if we needed anything. We were not able to go to the manager because he was standing in front of us waiting to order. The food was cold, and the manager was clearly annoyed with us."

The gnocchi was fresh and had a nice crunch to it. The sauce was great. The place was clean and nicely decorated. 

I would definitely come back here. I just wish there was more seating.We were on a road trip and needed a quick lunch before we headed to the airport. The menu has a variety of options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians."

Today we came for brunch. Looking to go to green eggs cafe. The wait was over a half hour so we figured lets go to the place we had dinner at. I'm very glad we did service was great. A little mix up with grits instead of home fries. Which they fixed in about 30 seconds. The lumberjack scrambler was amazing. Best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. (And I lived in the south for four years). If your in the area I would deffinatly recommend bourbon and branch."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm not picky when it comes to boba tea, I also can't claim to be an expert when it comes to boba tea, but of all the places I've lived this has been my favorite boba tea spot!
The brown sugar specialty tea is divine, the flavors are not overpowering and it was a wonderful treat!
The honey milk tea was also delicious, but I liked the brown sugar tea more!
The boba is flavorful without overpowering the flavors of the individual tea. I personally preferred the 50-75% sweet, and this is coming from someone that has a major sweet tooth.
They were wonderful during COVID and brought the drinks out to the vehicles to prevent lost interactions. 
Highly recommend, and we will definitely be back!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Decent upscale pizza place have multiple options and he environment was very relaxed and welcoming. Pizza is good and for those who haven't been you can add as many toppings as you want the base charge is the size of the pie and the thickness. Really recommend for those trying to have a pizza with different toppings. If you're looking for just pepperoni or single toppings you're better off somewhere else. The drink options vary and they do serve alcohol! They have a nice patio with lights on the side. Lastly, they do blast the A/C so if you get cold easily bring a light jacket if you're eating in. All in all a great place fresh new pizza joint in Sahuarita."

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place is a total rip off. The bar is closed. The restaurant is closed. The parking is NOT free as their website indicates; it's $22.00. The parking lot is next to a park where dozens of homeless people hang out. The only near by restaurant is domino's. The location is the pits. Not only is it in a very depressed boarded up area but it's too far & too dangerous to walk to anything. The arena is probably several miles away. Really, really disgusted with this hotel with the prices they charge & all the secret charges the sneak onto your bill. Two nights were almost $500.00 for what should have been a $75.00 per night hotel AT Best! Stay away!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Our friends told us about this place that had just opened up, so we decided to go check it out for lunch. When we went, we were expecting to probably have pizza or burgers, and were pleasantly surprised to see that the brunch menu was available!

I ordered an omelet, and my wife ordered a pork-laden pizza, and both of them were pretty great! The leftovers of the pizza were great too!

Since it was nice out, we sat outside, where they have a really nice space. Unfortunately, this meant that bees were around and pestered us a bit, but not too much could be done about that. Our server, Steve, was great, and he came over to help shoo the bees away too!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came in on a Saturday night. Got lucky to get a table with the seat yourself style dining. Ordered the potato skins, a beer, and an old fashioned. All were excellent except for the beer - it was warm. For my meal ordered the half hickory chicken, baked beans, and hot mustard sleep. Chicken was very dry, baked beans were good, slaw tasted just like slaw and hot mustard. After we received our meal- the waitress disappeared. I had to get my own condiments from the hostess station. I was not impressed with the BBQ sauce. There was curry based one that was ok, the rest were bland and disappointing. I may run it out again- but I'll sit at the bar."

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Delightful. We happened upon this tiny taqueria while passing through town. As other reviewers report it is a small place with seating for barely more than a dozen. The kitchen is open to view and the service somewhat lackadaisical.

I ordered tacos al pastor, which is pork marinated in pineapple. They were served with doubled, fresh corn tortillas and homemade rice and refried beans that were every bit as good as I've ever experienced.

The tacos themselves were spectacular. The perfectly seasoned pork was accompanied by strips of fresh pineapple. The flavors married perfectly. My long suffering spouse had carnitas, which were also good... But the al pastor were clearly the stars.

My only regret us the rarity with I pass through Kennet Square. Highly recommended."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Barely qualifies as Mexican food. I had the carne asada and if you blindfolded me and asked me what it was I would have had no idea. No seasoning whatsoever. Everything is clearly out if a can.

Also saw the bartender mix two beers in one glass and serve it. The bud light keg blew and he looked around to see if anybody was looking and poured the other half with Stella.

Also, all ""margaritas"" were poured out of a jug that looks similar to what antifreeze come in. No actual drink making. 

If you're staying in one of the neighboring hotels, do yourself a favor and go to one of the chain restaurants that are close by because that will be better than this."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"RJ and I tried to go to a restaurant up the street, but it closed early.  So we came here instead hoping it would be as amazing as last time.  Jessop's didn't disappoint!  We ordered the meatloaf again, and this time tried the shepherd's pie.  The meatloaf is literally the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  The shepherd's pie was good, I think RJ liked it better than I did.  I wasn't too crazy about the gravy. We shared both but could only finish the meatloaf, and took home most of the shepherd's pie.  Next trip will be fish and chips! I don't have many favorite restaurants in Delaware, but Jessop's is now on the list!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Very excited to come here. We had the prix fixe menu. Unfortunately the food wasn't entirely wonderful. Everything was a little too salty, a little too sauce-heavy and not entirely recommendable. I really enjoyed the shrimp and grits and the chocolate bread pudding but again the food could've been found elsewhere -- and not at such high price points. IT's nice to come here for the experience of eating at one of Emeril's restaurants but you can certainly find more nuanced food for the price point and the same food at a lower price point. +2 stars for food.

+1 star for service. The service here is excellent and we were sure to leave them a great tip, because of their friendliness and attentiveness."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went with seven old friends in town for a funeral. We chose this restaurant because they said we could bring an extremely well behaved dog along and sit on the shaded  back patio by the canal. Dog was very happy to lie by the fence and watch the ducks and geese. We were thrilled to find an interesting menu using locally sourced ingredients. We enjoyed pork schnitzel, mahi mahi and pulled pork tacos, and a couple of us got sandwiches. Service was good. Since they have an extensive cocktail menu and a good number of craft beers on tap, evenings are probably their most busy time. We were very grateful to them for a nice lunch in a dog friendly environment."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Have been here quite a few times. Service is always a little rough but I am always dumb enough to go back. This evening I went and it wasn't busy, which doesn't surprise me based off of their service. Sat there for 10 minutes and went to the bar and asked for menus. Got menus and was told our server would be right over. 10 minutes later we still didn't have a server so we left, walked across the street to Chaparritos and had menus and margaritas within five minutes as well as great service. Will never be back to La Vallesana. There are too many good Mexican restaurants to go to on Cherokee that offer way better service. Don't waste your time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Let's just start with the fries. The tap fries (with the garlic aioli) are life changing! If you order them as an appetizer it comes with a few different sauces but you can also just get them as a side with your food and add the sauces individually. 

The firecracker shrimp is by far the best appetizer. Think ""bang-bang shrimp"" from Bonefish but almost better. All of their burgers and sandwiches are good, but my favorite is the beer cheese steak sandwich. It is basically a philly smothered in their beer cheese (). 

They have a ton of options for beer and cider just make sure when you pull the menu up you look at the right location to see what they have."

The burger was delicious and cooked perfectly. The fries were also great.  The salad was tasty. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the burger was a little cold. I don't know how that happened but it's not a huge deal. I'm not sure if it was a bad day or just a bad day.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,Definitely try this place - it's the best!Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is super friendly and the food is good.  Great place to take a date or just hang out in the open air.I came here for the first time today. The staff was great. The place was clean and the owner was very friendly and gave us a free appetizer. I had the salmon with pork belly. The pork belly was sooooo good. I got the sweet potato fries which were yummy. The potato fries were okay but not amazing. They were served on a potato plate and tasted
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"One word, sauces. If this place had the right kind of sauces, you know the kind that condition you to come back for more, I would have given them 5 stars. I love the concept.

My original intention was to go in to the gas station and get my pump receipt, but after seeing this extremely well put together restaurant inside I just had to try it out. I encourage anyone in the Tampa area who drives by the the ""Taco Bus"" logo to try it out. I had the steak tacos and they were satisfying. I will defiantly be stopping by this place again, and I'm hoping I just missed those wonderful sauces and can give them an extra star on my next review."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Love this place!! We've had brunch and dinner here several times recently, and it's always delicious. This past weekend, we hosted a brunch for 45 guests to celebrate our twin daughters' baptisms. The event coordinator, Dan, was extremely responsive and accommodating. We reserved the sunroom for a private section of the restaurant with a personalized menu and a mimosa and Bloody Mary bar (BYO alcohol!). The food at the party came out just as timely and delicious (with large portions) as it had when we had dined for brunch/dinner by ourselves. All of the staff are wonderful and very friendly, and we had an amazing time! 

I would highly recommend this place for a meal any time of day and definitely for special events!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Finally went back here for brunch after a probably your long hiatus and had a wonderful meal! I've been on a big biscuit kick lately and the ones here did not disappoint. They had several choices for biscuit breakfast sandwiches and my friend and I each tried one. I had the ham and jam one and my friend got the brunch burger. 
The ham and jam was packed with tasty, crispy ham, scrambled egg, and delicious raspberry jam on two large buttermilk biscuits. Brunch burger had huge sausage patties, scrambled eggs, and some kind of tangy sauce that was absolutely delicious! Very generous with the portions we could not finish our entire plate.
The service was wonderful, friendly, and quick. Cannot wait to go back!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I've been in town many times and so far I've been here thrice. The service staff is friendly and knowledgeable and always greets you with a smile while walking in.  On the first visit it was for a company dinner with a group of 10.  Most of us at the table ordered the crusted seared ahi tuna which in my opinion is the best thing on the dinner menu.  It's so good that that's my go-to dish when at the restaurant for dinner.   On another trip during lunch I opted for Cuban sandwich with home made potato  chips.  The sandwich was on point, but the chips were so so. Overall this is a great place to eat."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"When I used to go here more back then the food was really good and I had no issues but the other week when I went with my boyfriend I was not pleased.
It wasn't so much of the service, the waitresses were checking up on us which is fine but my issue was the food. I had ordered the chili bowl and a Margarita grilled chicken and went home sick. I ended up throwing up because of the chili and the my chicken wasn't even cooked all of the way...
There was pink/red parts in the chicken and ended up not eating it. Needless to say I probably won't eat here for a while just cause I don't want to experience something like that again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place F-ing rocks.

The seafood selection is outstanding and the customer service is as well. I stopped in on the day before Christmas Eve (it was a Sunday) and a million people were packed inside, getting seafood for their Feast of Seven Fishes (as was I).  It was loud and overwhelming, but fortunately I was able to hand my list to the cordial monger behind the counter.  I'm sure this actually made the transaction more pleasant rather than shouting over the crowd.  I got a ton of clams, king crab legs, halibut and USA wild shrimp and scallops and the bill came to $84.00.

I definitely want to come back and eat in - they have a large prepared foods section too."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"BE WARE !!!!!! I've been a customer for over 30 years.  Always treat my out of town guests with dinner or lunch.  BE WARE!!!  First time I ordered sparkling water was told there was no large bottle for my guest and I, so we opted for the 2 - 1/2 bottles 16.0 oz  $13.00!!!!!!!!  No wonder the waiter never returned to ask if lunch was ok.  I addressed the issue at the front and was told that was the price.  I go to many upscale restaurants in the bay area and this is by far waaaaaaaaaaay over priced.  Lost me as a customer.  Imagine.  sparkling water?  John Haines Owner Operator Restaurants in Tampa."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Thank goodness Jollibee is here!  The food is amazing and the staff is always very friendly and accommodating.  The drinks are also great.  The drinks are always strong and strong!  If you like spicy drinks, this is a must try.I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant and was looking for a quick dinner. I went to the right place and was pleasantly surprised. The food was great, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. We were very excited to have a new Mexican restaurant in Reno, but we will definitely be back for more!This is the best place to eat and"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Excellent dim sum on Sat. We had the curry shrimp dumplings and the fried calamari. The curry shrimp dumplings were a bit overcooked, but the dumplings were so good. The calamari was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend had the shrimp dumplings and it was pretty good. I had the pork belly appetizer and it was so good. I wish I would have gotten the pork belly, but it was sooooo good. I had the sweet potato pancake, which was the best dish I've had since moving to Philly. I was a little disappointed by the breading"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My family and I come here a lot. We usually get the chicken salad, the shrimp and grits, and the fries. The fries are always fresh and tasty. The chicken salad is always good and fresh. The shrimp and grits is my favorite. The food is always good. We always order the chicken nuggets and they are always fresh and delicious. The prices are great. I always get the gyro and the fries are always good. The prices are very reasonable. The service is friendly and fast. The place is very clean. They also have a parking lot in front and a couple other spots."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,Just opened at the beginning of the year and we decided to try it for ourselves. We ordered the gnocchi and the Chicken parmigiana. The chicken parmigiana was amazing. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce was perfect. The gnocchi had a nice kick to it and was cooked to perfection. The chicken parmigiana was so juicy and delicious. My husband had the pork roast which was also really good. We will definitely be back!We had a party of 6 and the service was absolutely horrible. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for our food and we were told
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I wish I lived closer, but I wouldn't drive all the way to Nashville for this one.I've had the best experience here.  The staff was friendly and the food was delicious.  I ordered the salmon and I'm glad I did.  The salmon was very flavorful and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I also got the crab cakes and they were so good.  I will definitely be back.I used to love this place. I always feel very rushed when I come to this area. The service is slow, but the food is amazing. I always get the hummus, and the hummus"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,All I wanted was a nice place to go to watch a game. There were a few tables available so we sat at the bar. There were also a few tables inside. The food was good. I got the chicken tenders. I liked the meat. The sauce was good. The chicken was tender and juicy. The fries were good. I think they had the best garlic mashed potatoes I've ever had. The fries were very good. The chicken was moist. The burger was good. I'm not sure if I liked the wings better. The fries were good. The sauce was good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Oh. My. This place is a joke. 

I will admit that I have been to other places before but this is the most overrated place I've ever been to. The food is mediocre at best. The service is horrible. There are only two servers working. The manager is always a jerk and never comes to the table to check on the tables. There is also no social distancing or anything to even touch the tables. The manager never came to our table for drinks or anything to take our order. The food is absolutely awful. We had the crawfish etouffee and the shrimp and grit"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The staff is friendly and funny, and the portion of my first (ever!) Philly cheesesteak sandwich spanned two meals. I ordered it with American, onions, and hot peppers. The cheese seems to have been melted within the meat, not on top of it, which I thought was cool...get that cheese in there!...but I was surprised how it didn't really have much of a flavor. The bread was most disappointing. It was bland.  I may have had to try it with Cheese Wiz, or eat it in-house instead of taking it back to my AirBnB, or just added salt in order to have had a better experience. Though I've had much better sandwiches, I still thought it was cool to have a cheesesteak in Philadelphia."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went today and had the Daily Curry, which was peanut based with potatoes, pineapple, chicken, water chestnuts, and different vegetables.  More ""Indian"" and less ""Thai"" - I'm glad I went with my choice! I absolutely loved it.  My friend got the Phad Thai with tofu. She was hoping for a little more ""oomph"", so make sure you request your level of spiciness before ordering.  Being a little more pricey that most local Thai restaurants, I would hope they would make up for it with some kind of roll or soup with the lunch special, but it is an additional charge.  Had that had been part of the deal, I would've definitely given 5 stars.  Very friendly staff as well."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"As a previous barista, I can say Pour Richard's is honestly my favorite coffee shop in the Philadelphia area. They roast their beans on premises and you can taste the difference. Their coffee is extremely flavorful and never burnt. Whenever I am in the area, I go. I typically get a normal coffee because I love it so much but their lattes are very good as well.  I always get a side of almond milk, which is homemade, for my coffee. One of my other favorites is the chai latte, in which I add a shot of espresso to make a dirty chai. Their chai is also made in house. 

If you are a coffee snob (or not!) this is the place for you."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This restaurant was recommended by my cousin. The group of us were starving by the time we got to this location. Lucky for us, there was a short line that took about 10 minutes to be seated. The waiter was such a gentleman and very informative with all the dishes. We ordered the chargrilled oysters, gumbo, crab jambalaya! The food took much longer than expected. Though, it was worth the wait! I loved it. I never had anything so amazing, the food was flavorful, filling and delicious. The best part was everything was 10 percent off and the total for all the food was less than 60 bucks for a group of four girls! I would highly highly recommend this place for anyone visiting NOLA!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went a couple weeks ago and I ordered the pad Thai and it was different but very delicious. I enjoyed the food there and the complimentary green tea. It was so cute! Service was quick and they were very friendly. The spring rolls were also good. Just a bit greasy but I guess that's expected with spring rolls and I'm just being picky. While receiving the bill they told us there credit card machine wasn't working which was very inconvenient bc I didn't have cash on me and one of us had to go next door to find an atm. Other than that the food was very good, and a very Gabe round portion size. Other than the credit card machine mishap everything was great!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I got a coupon for my birthday for $5 off but it had to be at this location so I went back and gave them another try.  Looks like they cleaned house.  Only recognized one employee from the past.  The service was excellent, didnt see any of the staff just hanging around loitering like the last time.  My sandwich was perfect and delivered in a timely fashion.  Server had a smile and was very nice as well as the person taking the order.  They were busy cleaning tables as soon as other guest got up even though there were plenty of tables available.  I hate seeing staff sit around with dirty tables around me like the last visit."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This is one of the best hotels that I have been to in the Nashville Tennessee area.

Pros
-Scenery is amazing (especially if you have an inward facing room)
-Access to restaurants inside the hotel is admirable
-Rooms have excellent bathrooms and high pressure showers 
-Grand Ole Opry offers superior entertainment 
-Shuttle services from the airport was very quick (15 mins or less)
-The shuttle driver, who was an x army helicopter tech, had a very enthusiastic southern hospitality welcome
-The southern hospitality and welcoming attitude is far better than any Chicago hotel that I have stayed at
-Pool and fitness area was very clean and modern

Cons
-Very expensive 
-Most of the restaurants were way over priced for mediocre food (for the price it would have been better to go to local restaurants)"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"I'll more then likely never go back, as the prices are a bit high for the amount of food you get. The food is mediocre at best, and the portions are very small. The only reason I'd give it a four is because the service is excellent. The servers are extremely friendly and attentive, and the food is very fresh and flavorful. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try a new restaurant. I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Sunday Dec 2, 2018 1230, 2018

I'd like to see a lot of variety in the menu.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the steaks were tender.  My boyfriend had the Roasted Duck with Roasted Red Beans and Rice and it was fantastic.  The gravy was a little sweet but it was just right.  I had the Mac and Cheese and it was a perfect combination of flavor and sweetness.  My boyfriend had the Roasted Red Beans and Rice and it was great.  We also had the Chicken Fried"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Dewey's is set in a strip mall, with a parking lot full of restaurants, bars, and other shops. The restaurant is located in a strip mall, and the restaurant is located in a strip mall parking lot. The restaurant is a bit small, but with a lot of parking, it gets a bit crowded. The food is decent, but I wish it was a little more upscale. I had the salmon with pork, which was good. The portion size was good, and the sauce was good. My only complaint is that the food was a little pricey. I had the salmon, and it was really good"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This was the first not-so-good experience. I will admit that I was a bit disappointed. First, the food. The chicken was okay. The sauce was ok. The fried rice was not good. Second, the service. I had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table. I waited about 10 more minutes to get my check. I waited another 20 minutes to get my food. The waitress didn't even bring our drinks until she got our check. Finally, the food. I ordered the cheesesteak sandwich. It was pretty good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Love this place. First off, the food is amazing. We've eaten here before and the food is always delicious. The drinks are also great. The staff is always friendly. The atmosphere is nice. The only complaint is that the wait can get a little long. Otherwise, you'll have a great time.We have been going to this place for over a decade.  We have tried several different food trucks, all of which are great.  The food is always good, and the service is always friendly.  The best thing about this place is that they have a parking lot in front of the truck and a few"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Two and a half stars. We will be back!Very good food. Service is excellent. The owner is very friendly and helpful. He is the best customer service I have ever experienced. I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and it was great! I will definitely be back. I ordered a hamburger medium rare. It came out medium well and I was very happy with it. I like that they have a better selection of burgers than McDonald's. The burgers are a little too greasy for me but I usually eat them with a fork.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We have mixed reviews for Even Steven,  Our first order was a delivery to the next door cider house - absolutely fabulous Reuben and Mihami Vice  sandwiches.  Both were warm, tasty - remarkable even.  They delivered promptly and we loved the idea of a symbiotic relationship between the cider house and several local restaurants which will deliver a meal.

It was so great, we stopped by to order a Do Gouda sandwich and a BLT chopped salad.  They were good, but by no means great.  It could be the result of our taste buds, but we would not order these two again.

Pleasant wait staff, quick service, and reasonable prices.  Certainly worth a repeat visit, just be careful what you order."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,We were in Nashville for a conference and a local recommended Monell's. Hubby thought I was crazy when we got there and he realized that there was no menu and he'd have to pay to eat whatever they brought out at a table with strangers. He even thought he would keep his cell out. This was truly like eating at Grandma's house. The food was the ultimate comfort food. The pulled pork was my favorite and the homemade preserves on my biscuit made me skip dessert. We had lovely conversations with the other table guests and left full and happy. One note - once the food starts getting passed around keep up! Start out slow. I do wish I had gotten a clean plate for seconds.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I loved Carrabbas.  It has a very nice and comfortable interior. I like the ambiance. They had great menu choices but my husband and I both ended up getting the Chicken Parmesan and Baked Ravioli.  It was excellent!  We also tried their Lentil Soup and it was delicious.  But be careful because it has a major ""kick!""   They also serve a complimentary seasoning blend with extra virgin olive oil with house bread that is to die for.  That is some good stuff.  We had JP as our server and he was fantastic.  He really took care of us and educated us on quite a bit.  This was a great visit and we will definitely be back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I read reviews before I came here ... Brew haha is the restaurant for breakfast and brunch ... Not real crowed but I was not  happy at all cause they don't have much choose for your breakfast and coffee ...they let me down . I payed almost $15 for sandwich and a cup of coffee ...sandwich was good but coffee not better then wawa . the restaurant is nice and they have parking lot the frond of shop , wifi is free , you can order to go or have some tables inside .
That was nice they have magazine and news the frond of door ..
      Well I will come back again and give them other change and let see"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here for a snack and a few cocktails before our New Year's Eve party. It wasn't crazy packed and we were offered a taste of their daily cocktail right as we sat down. It was very refreshing and nice to sip on a drink while we decided what we wanted. Our server was nice and attentive even though it was NYE. We ordered the ""crap dip"" which came with some pita bread. It was very cheesy and rich. For drinks I ordered the ""Pho-cking"" which actually tasted kind of like pho. Very interesting and my first time trying something like that. My bf got one of the scotch cocktails and then ended up ordering the daily special. Overall a very chill experience with unquie drinks."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Second visit. I won't be back for food that's for sure!! The meat on my tacos was terribly tough. This also occurred during my first visit on opening night but I overlooked  it because they were super busy. When it happened again this weekend I decided I will not return unless it's for ice cream (their best asset). 

I ordered rice and beans but spent more time picking out crunchy rice. The street corn at their grand opening was fabulous, but not this visit. Salty and cold. 


 If you're looking for good food head to one of the many other delicious Mexican places on Cherokee! If it's sweets you're looking for The Taco and Ice Cream Joint is your place, just skip the tacos."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Update: the rose raspberry lemonade was an unpleasant surprise.  It tasted as if it was made with strawberries.  The raspberry was the most bitter and sweet lemonade I've ever had.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sweet flavor of the strawberry.  This is a great place for a special occasion.  I look forward to returning.  I hope they improve their service and the quality of food.  I'm not sure if the experience will be better.This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese.  It was very good.  I got the red snapper, and it was good"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We're the first two customers here. The hostess is very rude and unprofessional. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and the waffles had a lot of rice. The waitress told us to just sit down and wait for the server to come back. The waitress never came back to check on us and we waited another 10 minutes before she came back to check on us again. We left and went to another restaurant.I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries. I like their chicken wings"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Great place to go :)The food was good, but the service was terrible. I was seated in a booth next to a wall of paper and then the server was walking around in his chair with a huge tray of plates. I asked for a napkin and he literally pushed me down the wall. I asked for a refill and he literally had to tell me to go back to the table next to him. When I asked for my check he didn't even bother to ask for anything. I paid for my food and left. Will never go back. This place is great!  We had a great meal here."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This meal was definitely not what I expected. We ordered two appetizers, a small plate of fries and two small plates of the wings. The appetizers were okay. The fries were ok. The wings were not good. I would not recommend them. I will not be coming back.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the chef's special, the pork chop with ham and the chicken. Both were delicious and so was the salmon. I would highly recommend the fried chicken, it was very tender and flavorful. I also ordered a side of fries and they were great as"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I don't understand the frenzy here. The food is good but it's not worth the hype. Great atmosphere and great food! I got the ribeye, and it was great. The rice was very good and the sauce was very flavorful. The best part was the service. The waitress was very nice and attentive. I will definitely be back. I ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived 15 minutes after I placed it. I asked the driver what it was and he said it was ""cold. ""  I told him I had a delivery order and he said, ""well, that's what it's called."
Restaurants,2.0,CG,Solid A for food quality. We had the Ribeye which was a nice size portion. The portion was a little small but the flavor was worth it. The flavor of the meat was great. I had the ribs and they were very tender. The best part was the sides. The sides were great. The ribeye was the perfect size. The sauce was on point and the bread was perfect. My husband had the ribeye with Mac and cheese and it was a perfect size. The sauce was spicy and the Mac and cheese was great. I loved the mac and cheese. I had a great time here and will be back.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went here because I found it on Yelp and I loved the name.  I got a half-sandwich and a soup for $9, and my friend got a salad and a soup for about the same price.  She loved the watermelon soup that I ordered, and I enjoyed the soup that she ordered (I forget what it was).  She didn't like her salad all that much, but I loved my pulled pork sandwich.  The portions were perfect for her, but they were tiny for me.  I think it would probably be better to go for lunch than for dinner.

As I was leaving, I got a Vanilla Chai Shake for $4, and it was really good.  The service was pretty good overall."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This breakfast place is situated in a very nice neighborhood. Plenty of parking on the street and they are free on Sundays. I have to applaud their service. When we walked in a few Sundays ago, they had a bridal party along with their families in there (~15 people). I was a little bit worried that we would not be taken care of. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the server was attentive to our needs and patiently explained the menu to us. 
They have a couple crepe options, which is something you don't see in breakfast places sometimes. I ordered the Greek crepe. Our food came up very quickly.  It was very tasty. I'd definitely come back and try the other food on the menu."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Where do I even begin? First of all the food was late, extremely late over an hour! Finally it arrives and stuff is missing, a soup leaked and ruined most of the food and the edible food was cold! Then I call New China, 10x's (literally), and they just answered and hung up or sent me straight to voicemail. When eat 24 finally contacted them they stated to them they would not give us a refund for the ruined food..So now I have to pay for food I couldn't even eat.. If I could return the food I would, but instead I basically paid for trash. Extremely disappointed, so much so I created this account and am writing my first review ever! Buyer beware with this place!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Super upset to be posting this but I have to let others know. I was excited to learn that Main Street had vegan options on their menu so that my family who ate meat and my family who are vegan could all be pleased in one spot. After dining with Main Street multiple times I was just informed that their pizza dough actually has egg in it and now I am very upset because my family and I have been eating egg, while we are all vegan. If I was allergic this would have been a major issue. I will not go back and nor will any of my meat-eating Friends or Family in solidarity. Nothing like being lied to, especially when it comes to your health."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"After living in Tucson for 17 years I finally ate something from Veenerschnitzel (on Kolb). I have gone to the drive through a couple of times for the kids to get 'em a corn dog and me an ice-cream cone. I had the two chili dogs meal and it wasn't bad, but after having a Pat's chili dog you are spoiled. The fries were under-cooked, but edible. I want to try the Chicago dog another time, but will eat chili dogs somewhere else - even Sonic's are better, which ain't saying much. 

On a positive note, the staff was very warm and friendly and has been every time we have stopped by.

Having some Wolf brand chili and doing it at home is slightly better than this place."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place is certainly not the ""Best in Vietnamese"" as their sign proclaims. The pho was bland: the ingredients were lacking in quality and flavor. The spring rolls were of the same tasteless genre. I made the mistake of ordering a mojito, which arrived tardy to the table and did not possess the taste of a mojito because the sugar and soda were forgotten. 

An assortment of unseasoned vegetables did nothing to salvage the curry base, which was a more of a yellow water than a curry. I was under the impression that curry sauces are supposed to be flavorful. 

Add to this the prices, which are much higher than other (and better) places in town and you've earned one star. 

At least the decor was pleasant."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We're from the West Coast and have been to many places in NOLA, but this one is a hidden gem. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. The only downside is that it is a little pricey. I would suggest eating here if you are in the area. I love this place. I love the atmosphere, the food, the service. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken sandwich. It's always delicious. The sandwiches are amazing, too. The sandwiches are a little too greasy, but not bad. The chicken sandwich is really good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I have been on a search for the best vegan pizza in town. This is the first place we have found. The staff is friendly and the pizza is tasty. The crust is thick and the toppings are fresh. I would recommend it. This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we were very disappointed. We ordered the crab cake appetizer and my husband had the pork chop entree. The crab cake entree was very dry. The pork chop entree was very dry. The sauce tasted like it had been sitting out for a while and was not really good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I have to say I was a little disappointed with my food. The cheese steak was pretty good. The drinks were also a bit too sweet for my taste. I would definitely go back. It was a little pricey for what it is. But it's definitely a great place to hang out. I was very disappointed with the service and food at this location. We arrived at 4:00 and were told it would be 45 minutes. We were seated at the bar and were told it would be 45 minutes. After waiting 45 minutes for our food, we were told it would be 45 minutes."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Yelp stalker- first time writing this review, and we decided to try it for ourselves. We ordered the gnocchi, the Chicken parm and the chicken sandwiches. Everything was very good. We also had the bread pudding. Both were very good. My husband had the chicken parm and said it was the best he's had in a while. My daughter had the chicken parm. I had the chicken sandwich and it was pretty good. The bread pudding was good, not great, but definitely filling. I'm not sure if we'll be back for dinner, but I'm looking forward to it."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Blondie and I have eaten here a couple of times. I always love the cheese steak and the fries. The service is always great, and the food is consistently great. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer for your food. I usually get the steak with mashed potatoes and fries. They are always great. The fries are always good too.I love this place! Great coffee, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and the best hash browns I've ever had! They have a very good selection of beers on tap, and"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,Probably the worst fast food I have ever had.  I will never come back here.  The owner is not the best but he is the most awful person ever.  I will never go back.  It was a long time before I even visited and I still have no idea what happened.  I have to go back and tell the owner and tell him to come check on me because I will be telling him to do it to my family because he will never come back.  I have never been to a fast food restaurant like this before and I won't go back.  You are the worst fast food I have ever had
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"I remember why it's been a couple years since I last went there even though it's less than a mile from my home. I waited 25 minutes in the drive through with only 4 cars ahead of me, including 13 minutes for the car just in front of me. When I finally got my burger and fries, the fries were too cold to eat. When I opened my burger when I got home a few minutes later it was cold all the way through. I tossed the fries and ate the cold burger because I was hungry. They must have made my order shortly after I gave it to them and then let it sit for over 20 minutes to get that cold. Last time I'm going there."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I have loved Seminole subs for years.
I have been a regular at several locations for years. 
Yesterday, I  visited the Seminole subs on Main st Dunedin/Clearwater.
Because of COVID 19, I  used the drive through.  No waiting, no customers.
When I  arrived at the window, the young girl was fixing her hair. No gloves no mask and no handwashing before opening the window to take my money. I could see into the kitchen from my vantage point, an unmasked ungloved gentleman was preparing my order.  Ummmm....I think not. I just drove away. Even without a mask, these other behaviors are unacceptable in normal times.
Let alone during a pandemic when your customers are relying on you to help keep us safe.
Really, Seminole Subs, I expected better."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I am so happy to have found this gem.  There is nothing that I don't love.  The espresso macchiato is delicious.  The eclair is the very best I have eaten..ever!!  Love the scones, croissants, quiches, apple strudel, etc.  Ordered the apple and pumpkin pie during the holidays and my daughter fell in love with the pumpkin pie.  Can't wait for them to start the key lime pie.  They started making soups and today was the chicken lemon orzo. Unbelievable, Mama!  Nick and Christiana are friendly and kind and eager to help.  The shop is so cute and quaint and the patio under the huge oak trees is amazing.  Please please stop by and share your business with them."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Omg! The best ever Shawarma Ive eaten! Trust me, I've eaten many shawarmas in my life, however this shop! Wow! It was amazing! Got myself a chicken platter. Worth every penny! It's a different type from normal shawarma however, you must try it! 
Make sure you give good tips! It's a family owned shop! His children were helping out too! It was such a great way to spend my money on such good food! I'm happy to support such sweet family! I was literally obsessed to go back again the next day! 
PS: just make sure they are open by calling! Because I went there twice and it was closed even though with the normal operation hours, they should've been opened. Normally they will be there from 1pm!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Thought I had found pizza heaven when I found Slice, but then I ordered the arugula, prosciutto, reggiano pizza at Pesto and I had to make room in my heart and stomach for another wonderful pizza option in my delivery area.   It is a cold pizza, sort of a wonderful salad on a lovely, light, crispy crust.  Most of the special pizzas we have tried have been very good.  For a hardier meal the potato pizza is pretty yummy.  We have always gotten delivery and the order is always correct and quick to our door.
Recently, I discovered that a new brick oven pizzeria is opening soon just a few blocks away, so happy to be living at the pizza nexus of the universe."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I too was in Nashville for travel.  
Fortunately my coworker is a food snob and she did her research to save us from hotel dining.  This place was great.  We sat upstairs and had one of the best, most attentive waiters I've experience (tall, slim guy with glasses).  He started us out with a sample of a mushroom and asparagus tart - which was heavenly.  After that we shared a few of the items on the menu and then the steak.  I can't remember the details of our meal now, only that it rocked.  Also, another fun thing, they beer there is sold under their liquor license as a ""high alcohol content"" beer.  

This is definitely on my to-go-back-to list."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We have been here almost every week and the food is good. We have been here twice since we moved to the area, both times the food was great. The first time we had the fried chicken and it was so fresh and moist. The second time we ordered the pork belly and it was so good. I had the pork belly with the rice and beans and it was so good. The service was great and the atmosphere is nice. I will definitely be back for sure. They also have a lot of great food. I highly recommend it. This is the best place to eat and have a good meal."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Reasonable priced drinks, great outdoor seating, and the food is good. 

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, seasoned, and great.I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to try something new since I heard great things about it. I was not disappointed. The restaurant was clean and inviting. The staff was very attentive and friendly. My only complaint is that I was seated too late for my dinner time. I ordered a lamb shank and it was cold and"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This was only my 2nd time here and the food was good but not spectacular. I ordered the duck and it was very good. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The duck was ok. The duck was not seasoned well. The duck had some chunks of duck fat on it. I think it's because they were the most overrated part of the dish. I've had better duck elsewhere. The service was good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd definitely go back for the duck though.This is my favorite coffee shop.  I love their espresso drinks, coffee, and other beverage options.

Restaurants,2.5,CG,"This is the old Tengo, it's the best in Nashville. 

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty.  I've been to many other places and this one is a bit better.  I don't know how many people love it. 

I think it's a great place to eat at.I love this place. It's so good.  I'm on a diet and I feel very healthy. The food is amazing. I'm not sure if I've ever been to a restaurant where I didn't feel super full and had a good meal."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Stumbled across this gem with a friend and we were in the mood for some good BBQ! We ordered a burger and the fries. The burger was crispy, seasoned, and juicy. The fries were a little spicy, but good enough to keep me from going back for more. The staff was great, friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back!Delicious food and service!  We had the grilled salmon with pork belly and it was delicious.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get.  I'm not sure if we will be back for dinner, but I'm looking forward to it!Good food, great service."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,Yea something is amiss here. We have been here many times and it's always great! The service is always great and the food is always delicious. The salad bar is huge and I love that it's made fresh. The outside dining area is also very nice and clean. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the lamb gyro and it was excellent. I also had the chicken tikka masala which was delicious. The portion size was perfect and the price was right. I would highly recommend the tikka masala. This place is great!  We had a great meal here.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Having read Tucson Foodie I went to Jewel Sunday at 2:00PM. We thought the food was tasty, good fried dumplings and good green onion thin pancake cut like a pizza. Bad things though, not enough staff, evening prices for brunch, half full tea pot. The waitress was the wife of the chef, but he was not happy and was arguing with her in Chinese over the 45 minutes we were there. I wanted to love it and they only opened 4 days ago BUT they are just not ready for prime time - and no music??? I've been to HK and China and Vietnam, and I wanted nothing more than to find some GOOD, AFFORDABLE, Chinese food in Tucson. My hand were itching to write up a business plan..."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place serves authentic Xi'an food, just like the ones in Chinatown and old city. There was a documentary made about the family who opened these restaurants but I didn't get to see it. The reason there are a plethora of Sichuan items on the menu is because the owner is a trained Chuan-cuisine chef. But he is from Xi'an. And of course, don't forget to add some standard American-Chinese items to satisfy the taste buds of average Americans and what they expect to find in a Chinese restaurant, which I'm okay with unless when the restaurant is packed. My only complaint is that the meat in the Chinese burger is a little too lean. That's not authentic enough for me, but maybe it's intentional to make it healthier."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Get the Triple Play. 3 Taco for $9, when they would otherwise be $6 a pop? No brainer. You also get a free token for the batting cages, just take your receipt to the cage guy. You'll need something to do while you wait because it gets busy here. I was happy to see East Beach Tacos doing so well because at first glance I thought that there wouldn't be room for another taco place on Milpas. East Beach Tacos is pretty much nothing like the other places, it's like sushi roll tacos. The gangnam style taco is hella good. I would probably give that one in particular a 5/5. Burger isn't that bad, it's like the rookie version of Kahuna. The fries taste like McDonalds soo that's good."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here with the bae's fam jam while visiting the US to have a nice dinner. Tasty chips and salsa to start. The highlight was the guac, very fresh and yummy. I enjoyed my meal but it wasn't my favourite Mexican food I have had in my life. The service was friendly enough. I wish I had a better command of the Spanish language as I feel it would have been useful in ordering our meals. The majority of our group does not eat beef, but somehow it ended up that everyone had chicken filled everything, including people who didn't order their meal that way. We ordered a couple of desserts to share and finish the meal, deep fried ice cream and a banana chimichanga, both of which were tasty."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The Real Deal...Simply the best N.Y. Pizza!!

We have travelled across the state searching for good N.Y. Pizza, we read all the reviews and try them...most are embarrassing to even state real N.Y. Pizza.
  This is not some crappy fast food pizza chain, or trendy ""coal oven gimmick"" place, JUST GOOD PIZZA PIE, with good ingredients.
To the other guy Gary L....get real, these people work long hard hours EVERYDAY. when it's time to close, it's time to close and they want to go home to family and friends too. Maybe a little curtesy when calling in? I would be ashamed to call 3 minutes before a shift end. Then have the gall to leave a bad review because of it. Oh well, your loss, all types can leave reviews."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"There are a handful of reasons why I miss Tucson: the Tohono Chul Park, 4th Ave, basketball games at McKale, and Jonathan's.  My parents first brought me here when I was a wee thing, I remember my first taste of wine was at Jonathan's.  I try to get here every time I am in Tucson.  Their menu is superbly unbeatable.  From classic prime rib, to the liver and onions which is incredibly hard to find these days, Jonathan's offers a distinguished variety of carnivorous taste pleasures.  It's old school cool too, Jonathan makes regular appearances and it is easy to become a business barfly here because of the clientèle and the bartenders are easy going sway. Dig it.  Man I miss it here."

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We were a little put off by the fact that they didn't have happy hour, but the staff was so friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious! We shared the fried green tomatoes and the Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were absolutely delicious! I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes and Brussels sprouts! I will definitely be back and I will definitely try the Brussels sprouts!We had a great experience here. We were seated right away and the staff was very attentive and professional. Our waiter, David, was very attentive, professional and pleasant. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"After 15 minutes seated, we asked for the server to come back and ask us if we needed anything. We waited for the server to come back and ask if we wanted anything else. He came back and asked if we needed anything else. Then he told us he had to find someone else to take our order. We were the only ones in the restaurant and he only came back to take our order. When we asked for a receipt, he never came back and told us he had to find someone else to take our order. The manager came over to get our bill, but it was still wrong. The server never came back."

The beers were great, but the appetizers were a bit too strong for my taste. I ordered the salmon taco which was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the shrimp tacos and said they were very good. I will definitely be back and try the other dishes on the menu.We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed.  I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the salmon salad.  Both were very good and our server was very nice.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I usually never buy pasta here, but the food is good. The only thing I would change is the dessert. The ice cream is okay, but the dessert is pretty mediocre. It is hard to get a taste of the ice cream. I don't know how the texture of the ice cream is, but it is good. I think the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is on a busy day. This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good. I got the red snapper, and it was good."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Went to the Mud House last night and the food was good.  The waitress was nice and we sat down at the bar.  We ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious.  We also ordered the smoked turkey which was also very good.  I ordered the smoked wings and they were great!  I would definitely go back!I had high hopes for this place. I was expecting more of a divey atmosphere and the food was nothing special. I got the sweet potato fries and they were just ok. The fries were okay but not great. They were served on a potato plate and tasted like they were put on a
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is hands down one of the best steakhouses I have ever been to.  I have had some of the most memorable steaks of my life here.  They always seem to have a special aged steak option that is, well orgasmic...not kidding I've had to clean my shorts a couple times after this place. 

Before you even get to the steak, there is the most amazing shrimp cocktail ever.  No joke, if you haven't had this, stop reading this and go right now.  

If you love history, this place is a must see.  It has been in Indy for over 100 years!  

Fair warning:  I would not suggest this place for a quiet, romantic dinner as it can be quite busy and loud."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was recommended to order 3 crab legs from Sin Clair, but was never informed that they would be served cold with no butter. When you say crab legs, most people think of receiving a plate of crab legs steamed, but this was ONE crab LEG for $150. ON ICE. We ended up spending $500 at the restaurant after the fact (including the tip) and still needed to stop somewhere to eat on the way back home. Very disappointed with the service and the food - will not be coming back. I thought this place would be better than your average chain restaurant, but it turns out it is worse with a bigger price tag. I would have been more satisfied going to a McDonald's than this place."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Food here is excellent and staff is very friendly. If you like wings the Hen Wings are a must. The wings take on the traditional flavors associated with Vietnamese cuisine sweet, savory, and smidge of spice. Flavors are very reminiscent of Nuoc mam sauce. I've had the Banh Mi and the Pho and while the Pho isn't the best I've had it's definitely one of the best places I've had in NJ. Banh Mi was very good, however the thing I wasn't thrilled about was the bread. It's personal preference of mine for bread that is a bit crispier, so I didn't take off any stars. The sandwich appears to be on the smaller side, however it is packed full of meat and toppings making it filling. 5/5 highly recommend."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I just left local 44 incredibly annoyed. I have a temporary paper license from the DMV while I'm waiting for my new license. This id has worked at the airport, multiple bars, and a club. When I was at the bar at Local 44 with a few friends tonight, I was asked for my id. When I gave the bartender my license, he said that I need a ""real"" ID. I explained the situation and said it is a legal document from the DMV. He not only wouldn't serve me, he made me leave the ""premises"". I will never come back to this restaurant and will tell my friends to avoid the rude bartenders who are think of themselves so highly that they're enforcing the law better than TSA agents."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Very disappointing.  I wish I had read the reviews before going.  I used to go when it was Tin Tin and the food was pretty good then.  Not anymore.

I ordered the house wontons which were supposed to contain scallops too but I couldn't tasted them.  The wontons were soggy and just flat.  The noodles were soft and just tasteless.

The price was even more outrageous.  Medium wonton noodles $18.  Tasteless broth.  The vegetables seems lifeless and not prepared well.  I was surprised that there seems to be regulars there.  I'm never going back.

To have the word ""wonton"" in name of the shop, you'd think that the wontons would be amazing?  You'd be wrong.  

""Pricey and tasteless"", sums it up."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Absolutely  love  this place, they offer a great atmosphere. I absolutely  love  coming  here for food drinks and a place to  chill. There is a rule where you have  to  buy a drink  to order the delicious  food. But the  drinks  are totally  affordable  as is the food. I especially  love the beef kabobs  you have  to  try one if you're  there. They also have  a new pork kochi kabob that is so delicious  and spicy, it is only a $1. Like what a deal. I also like the sauce bar, the Chipotle  mayo is a great condiment for the fries. Definitely  my new go to spot"

I did like the fact that the rice was a little softer than I liked. The chicken curry was a little bland and lacked flavor. Overall, I would go back again for a curry, but I'd probably stick with the chicken curry.

Restaurants,2.5,CG,The food is ok  but not the best.  I will say that the service was horrible.  The waiter had to ask for water and then the manager came to take our order.  The food came out in a timely manner.  I ordered the seafood gumbo and the shrimp and grits.  I ate most of the gumbo and it was tasteless.  I didn't want to eat it because I am not a seafood eater.

That's why I gave four stars . Gluten free pizza , perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings and always hot. I, also, always carry-out and never rely on delivery. Like I said ORDER ONLINE .

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place is dank. My boyfriend was craving street tacos so I Yelped tacos in the area and this place popped up. The setup is similar to Chipotle. You go down an assembly line of options. They have a variety of meat options so I went with the standard carne asada taco ""mexican style."" They also have ""gringo style,"" but why would you do that? (hehe) They also have chips and salsa included with your purchase and they are extremely fresh homemade tortilla chips. Their horchata is the perfect amount of sweet. Their churros are delicious! They are different since they are filled. The filling helps offset the sweetness from the sugar coating on the outside. Be prepared to get messy! I would definitely come back to this place. It's bomb.com."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Don't come here @ 230 on a Tuesday afternoon to expect a good time... Place was pretty beat. Should have figured right ? We got seated quickly and the food came out even quicker, talkin like less than 5 minutes. The crab fries were awesome as expected but the cheesesteak was pretty lousy... The steak lacked flavor was served cold but with warm cheese on top and was tough as leather. What's up with raw onions on a cheesesteak ? Fry that s**t up Mon.
My skunky Amstel light was another kick in the balls...

Crab fries - the ONLY reason you should come here. Spend the 5.75 and walk away to the nearest bar in the casino.

Btw the waitress kicked ass. Too bad can't say the same about the beer or food."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Last night was my first time eating oysters. I was a bit skeptical at first but the gentleman shucking them in front of me at the bar was a pretty smooth talker. He wasn't pushy in any way, just reassuring. His name was Ru and he gained my trust rather quickly. Before I knew it, I had tried all three of the oysters they had to offer and I thought they were delicious. I'm glad he was there to explain everything to me because I might have backed out! Actually, I'm a little disappointed I didn't do it sooner! 

Also had the crab cake, a couple beers and a Monday special 1/2 price bottle of wine. This all made for a very enjoyable late night date, I'll be back for sure."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The first time I went here I felt like I got better tacos. I did order different tacos the second time so there's that.  I think their standouts are their spicy items.  Lots of flavors and textures from pickled jalapeño to mango and refreshing slaw.  Yelpers get free chips and queso.  The first time I got it the chips were hot and fresh and I ate the entire serving.  The second time they were cold and some were rather limp so I had 1/4 of it.  Seems like it's a bit hit or miss depending on the day but it won't keep me from coming back. My favorite is the west coast shrimp taco.   I want to try the breakfast tacos some time.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Out of the few AYCE sushi/hibachi places in Tampa, friends recommended to try this place and it was a decent choice for Sunday afternoon lunch. For our party of 7, we were instantly seated and service was fairly quick throughout the entire meal. For about $15/per person, there's a pretty good variety of sushi, nigiri and hand rolls for whatever you're craving. 

The sushi rolls aren't too large for an individual order, so you're able to try a few different rolls before you're full. I opted to also try the vegetable fried rice and lo mein, but it had almost more vegetable than carb. The veggies were slightly undercooked too, so I may just stick to ordering sushi the next time I come. All in all, good service and decent sushi."

The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you come here for the food, you can get a table for two or three if you can't find one. There is also a small parking lot in the back. I think it is nice to be able to sit in the back if you have a reservation. You can also park in the back if you don't want to park in the back.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"*****review was for the downtown location......accidentally posted wrong location, but do intend to try the one in Clayton too****

My review is based on carry out and delivery. I must say I am not impressed at all. Maybe dining in would taste better than carry out. I've had the magic carpet ride.....love all sorts of mushrooms but this was extremely salty for my taste. Only had a couple bites and couldn't handle it. I also tried both of their desserts.....Apple calzone was very doughy. And Nutella banana was very mushy and delivered all mushed up...looked like the box may have dropped a few times before being delivered. Again, maybe dining in would be much better. I will try SOTS again but for dine in only. When that Happens I will update my review."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Awesome lunch spot! Had a weekday lunch reservation but didn't need it as it was pretty empty. Much larger restaurant than I was anticipating. 

Started with the date truffles. They were interesting, though maybe better suited for a dessert as they're quite (understandably sweet). The flatbreads were sooo good. I had a chicken flatbread sandwich, and the chicken was fine (maybe a bit too much mayo based sauce in it for me) but didn't matter because the bread itself was fluffy and buttery and chewy and delicious! The fries it came with were super thin and crispy with a great seasoning blend that wasn't overly salted. Quite a nice portion. 

Our server, Blaise, was great! Also for those with food allergies, they have a special allergy menu that was quite in depth."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The restaurant, under the umbrella of the company which operates The Cheesecake Factory, is beautiful and the menu enormous and tempting.  We were seated at a small booth for two, which was acceptable, given some of the alternatives, being seated right next to other parties.  The food turned out to be a disappointment overall.  The chicken and mushroom soup was an ample portion and tasty. The bread was mediocre. Our entrees of fettuccine alfredo and chicken pot pie looked delicious, but were bland and unsatisfying.  Service was satisfactory.  My wife and I did not have dessert, but the desserts that were displayed looked delicious. I suspect this is one area in which the association with The Cheesecake Factory is worthwhile.  This spot is a poor value."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was visiting Nashville on my own for work and after doing some research I discovered Henley. I was looking forward to dinner at the bar because I was on my own. I had a lot of trouble getting the attention of the bar tenders, even though it was not that busy, so I eventually gave up after a glass of wine and some dinner rolls that I ordered to suppress my hunger while I picked an entree. The ambiance was nice, but a bit uncomfortable in my opinion. They're definitely trying to make a certain vibe and I just had trouble buying in. I am from Chicago, so maybe it was just not what I'm used to. Overall I regret the $32 for (delicious) bread rolls and a glass of wine."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Surprisingly, there a lot of good reviews about this place. I even saw one guy say he was looking for the best roast beef in the city and thought Guy's was up there. I don't know what he was smoking. Parkway, Tracey's, Mahoney's... anywhere but this place.  Granted I've only eaten there once, but that was the least work I've seen put into a roast beef poboy in a long time. PEOPLE, if the restaurant is selling deli meat cooked down in gravy, IT IS NOT A REAL ROAST BEEF! I haven't tried anything else but my buddy got some kind of pork poboy and wasn't too impressed either (it looked pretty bad, so I didn't try it). To add to the disgrace, we waited almost an hour for our poboys."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I am now two for two o.m.g.c.r.a.c.k. at Smoke Et Al.  #1 they have a good health score.  #2 the food is absolutely amazing.  It took me two bites into the ribs to wrap myself around the flavor and then after that I sucked them dry.  The chicken tacos were so moist and flavorful.  The cabbage and apple slaw is not mayonnaise-y and the bay thyme lemonade is refreshing and light.  Tonight my mom and brother had the Nashdog and inhaled them.  Very full and the price is under $10.  

They have a Google calendar that you can download off their website and merge with your own--that's how I know where they are.  You can also follow on their website, Facebook, and Twitter."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I went here it was a little more expensive than other places but I didn't mind. The food was delicious. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The mac and cheese was a little bland. The potato salad was also very good. I would definitely go back. I just wish the place had a little more seating on the patio so you could take your time getting a drink and enjoying the atmosphere. The service was excellent. This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good. I got the red snapper, and it was good."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"This is one of my favorite places in the area. I always get the cheese steak and the fries. The service is always great, and the food is consistently great. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer for your food. I usually get the chicken tenders and they are great. I always get the gyro and the fries. The chicken tenders are good, and the fries are good too. I'm not sure if I've ever been to a restaurant where I didn't get the gyro but it is always good. The fries are not great"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This little unassuming spot tucked into a strip mall on a busy street. There is a large outdoor seating area and a very open front door.  The menu is simple and you get a nice variety of options.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I had the shrimp and grits and a fried egg with a side of cornbread. The grits were a little bland but I liked the flavor.  I highly recommend this place.I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries. I like their chicken wings, but it's kind of"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This restaurant was one of the last restaurants we went to for dinner. When we got there, we were told we had to wait 20 minutes to get seated. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get our drinks. The hostess came to our table and apologized for the wait. Then she gave us our check. I ordered the Beef and Rice and it came out cold. I will never order from here again.I used to love this place. I always feel very welcome. The food is always great and the service is great. I love that they have a parking lot in front of the restaurant and a few tables outside. The food is always fresh."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I used to frequent this location a couple years ago. I now work for a small business and we frequently go there. The food is always good and the service is always great.I'm so excited to come back to this place. The food is amazing and the staff are very friendly. We have ordered the chicken nuggets and they are AMAZING! I haven't had anything I didn't like. The fries are also great! The only thing I would change is the price of the fries. I don't know about you, but I'm not a huge fan of the prices on the fries but the fries are great and they have a lot of great"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"My husband and I come here a lot. We usually get the chicken salad, the shrimp and grits, and the fries. The fries are always fresh and tasty. The chicken salad is pretty good. It's not the best chicken salad I've ever had, but it's definitely the best. The shrimp and grits are also good. The fries are also good. I love that they offer different dipping sauces. I usually go for the chicken salad with a side of fries. The shrimp and grits are a little bit smaller, but they are still good. They are usually a little too salty for my taste, but they are still good."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"You probably should have been to a Jimmy Johns before in your life...but if you missed that boat here is the low down...

Ridiculously fast subs. I am pretty sure they have been done before I was finished ordering. Makes you think you would get some thrown together mess of veggies and cheese but they end up neat and delish every time. (Have only tried Vegetarian Sub for reasons I assume are obvious now. P.S. They only have ONE veggie sub).

Friendly enough staff. Gets pretty busy because of the location right on the circle. Lots of hipster fixie kids (not to talk sh*t my boyfriend is one of them haha). Wait is never long. 

This is my choice stop if I am smack downtown. Cheap, fast, good food and outside seating for people watching."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner on my birthday! I'm so glad we made a reservation (for a Saturday night) because it was PACKED. Pretty sure we would have had to wait a really long time to get seated otherwise. 
I'm not vegan, but all of the food we ordered was fantastic! My two favorite dishes were the Spanish meatballs and the buffalo cauliflower tacos. The meatballs had a realistic texture and the bread was nice and crispy. As for the tacos, you couldn't even tell that you were eating cauliflower! 
We ordered a total of 4 dishes and 2 drinks, so the entire meal was very filling. The restaurant was dark but gave a nice ambience. When I'm back in Philly, I'd love to come back here to try the brunch!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is a fancy restaurant with fancy prices and fancy food. The service etiquette was seriously lacking. We had a table of seven.   The waiter took the order from the head of the table instead of from the two women first. The sides were brought out four minutes before the main plates which again were not served to the two females at the table 1st. Two dessert menus were placed on the table. Once the waiter got to me,  he asked what I would ask for dessert when he hadn't even given me a dessert menu. My espresso arrived and was finished before my dessert arrived. Again poor timing, poor etiquette and the waiter did not ""crumb"" the table. The food was good, but overpriced for the service level received."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,Worst experience at a S n S ever! After standing for 5 minutes server shouted we could sit anywhere. She explained they were having a tough night because of new workers. We ordered shakes and burgers. Our shakes came out right away but in to go cups instead of the usual glasses. We sat for an hour.:: no burgers and no updates provided. We watched two tables of customers leave. Our server shouted at customers entering that it would take an hour to get their food. Between shouting at customers and shouting at the kitchen help it was an unpleasant and stressful experience.  We looked in the kitchen and our food was no where in sight so we left. This place doesn't deserve a second chance or your business. Don't go there.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This hole-in-the-wall sushi restaurant is not fancy like the others in town, but the sushi is good & the wine pours are even better. 

I typically stick with their simple rolls which are very reasonably priced (think under $5). But they also offer specialty rolls that are more of your standard sushi pricing ($10+). 

Now let's get to the wine... healthy pour & I mean BIG for $6. They also offer all beer for $2 (with purchase of sushi, $3 otherwise) Yep, that's right $2 corona's every night of the week. Buyer beware: they don't have limes & if you ask will offer you a lemon (LOL). 

The staff is very friendly and they have a nice, little outdoor patio overlooking the heart of broad ripple that I love during the warmer weather."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Okay lets get real. You're in a farmers market with all sorts of FRESH veggies and you want something to eat and if you eat at the Chinese Restaurant, you're going to be disappointed if you were thinking FRESH. 

There is not 1 item on this menu that is from the actual market but you know it's just like most strip mall Chinese Food Joints, frozen food. Look I've eaten it a few times and never gotten sick. The rice is a bit mushy and the chicken super deep fried. The staff is real nice, fast, and I think their area/ space where their place is clean. I like how they offer 1 free refill AND free siriracha AND a free fortune cookie. 

Its just a OK place. Not bad, but just bland."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Stopped by recently for 8 oz. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our server was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The only reason we go there is because of the good reviews. I've been going to this place for almost 3 years and it's always good. I've always had great service and great food. I like the cheesesteak sandwich, but I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't like. The burger is amazing, but I've never had a bad meal here. I usually go for the lunch buffet but today I went for lunch."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've walked past this place a couple times and it's always a nice place to sit and eat.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were good. I had a burger and fries. I did get a side of the fries which were ok. They were a bit over cooked but I like them. The fries were good and crispy. The beer was cold and I had to wait a bit for my food. I'm not sure why the restaurant was packed but it was a good time for a burger and fries. 

"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The food and drinks here are always top notch. The service is always excellent, the food is always delicious and the drinks are always hot. 

I think this place is going to be a regular stop for me. I will most likely be going back to try the other items on the menu. I have also tried the vegetarian option and the bbq burger. I also love the live music. 

This place is always clean and inviting.This is a great place for a romantic dinner or a date. The food is great and the service is great. This place is super cute and the people are really friendly. The food is not great but"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars but it's just not the best Chinese food I've had. The food is mediocre and the service is not good either.I'm so excited to come back to this place. The food is amazing and the service is great. I love the food and the atmosphere. I will be coming back and recommending to friends as well.We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed. The food was delicious, and the service was great. I would highly recommend the fried chicken, as it is one of my favorite dishes. We also ordered the steak and shrimp pasta. The steak was cooked perfectly and the shrimp"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Great for Meh-tairie that they are located in the area. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty good, but the food was not great. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing that I would change is the amount of seafood they serve. The only thing that I would change is the amount of meat they serve. If I lived in Philly I would probably just go there to eat some food. Great experience, great atmosphere, good food, great service! 

We were seated right away, and the waitress was very attentive. I had a great time, and the food was great."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Our first quest after landing in New Orleans was to try this restaurant. This is the first restaurant we visited that we had a bad experience at. The hostess was not very attentive and we had to ask her to be more attentive. The food was ok and the service was good. However, the food was not good at all. The food was very salty and tasteless. I will not be returning. Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch, but the decor and ambiance of the restaurant was quite nice. We sat at the bar and had a good time. The food was fantastic."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"They are overpriced for the small amount of food they give you (literally, make a circle with your hands and that's the amount of food i got and they charge $23 for it. I returned it) and do not have enough servers on the floor so I was waiting an extremely long time to just get my drink and to especially get my bill. The drinks are good and it's a nice set up inside but if you plan on getting the jerk chicken for $23, don't, just save your money and go get a jerk platter from a Jamaican spot for $11. If you want to feel fancy for a night and aren't that hungry, this is the place but if you want good quality food with a good quantity, go somewhere else."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"New to the Tampa area. Siri and Yelp led us to Paul's?  Was it good deep dish pizza???  yes!  Best we have had since we have been down here.  I moved from the Chicago area and good pizza places are a dime a dozen there.  I was craving a deep dish pizza and I left Paul's completely satisfied.  The sauce is fantastic!!  We also tried a small thin crust and it reminded us of one of our favorite places back home.   Good stuff!!  To whomever is reading this and is contemplating going to Paul's.... Stop reading, get in your car, and drive down to see Paul!!  You will love it.   The guy has direct tv too with all the NFL games!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Originally from California, been looking for a good Korean place for a while.  The location is interesting but the place itself is cute inside. Bimbibap is normally what I order, basically it is meat, veggies, egg over rice in a stone bowl. When you get it make sure not to stir the bottom too much since you want the rice to get a little crispy, it's a nice treat at the end. The meal is really hot (in temperature), I normally put the sauce over it (provided to you in a ketup bottle), its not too spicy.  They have two bimbibap here, have tried both, both is good. They provide you with around 6 little side dishes which are tasty. Overall it has been the best Korean I have had in Fl."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We ordered some food for delivery from the Lingnan on one night when my wife, Sarah, was craving some chinese food. We've found that the only vegetarian dish on your average Chinese delivery menu here in Edmonton is a mixture of garlic, tofu, and random vegetables. And sometimes you can get mushroom chow mein. And while tasty, the combination can get a bit tiresome.

Because there was a broader collection of dishes on the Lingnan's menu, we decided to order from them. And while their spring rolls are the best we've tried in the city, the chow mein and the cashew vegetable dish we ordered were somewhat bland.

I'll give the Lingnan another shot the next time that Sarah has a spring roll craving and I hope that the other dishes we order will be tastier."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This used to be our favorite spot for bourbon noodles. Well today we got our food and it was horrible. I get some places have their busy days but prices went up but the quality went down!!! Our noodles both came super soggy!!! A lot of vegetables and barely any noodles in them. Our spicy clams that normally tastes great tasted like it's just boiled and the sauce just sat at the bottom. 
They kept telling us they ran out of the house salads that they give out for lunch for the 4th time. If they stop giving it out then just say so..don't have to lie. Won't be coming back here. 
Spent over $40 for lunch and it was garbage! I guess they don't need our business since they've gotten a little busier."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"SO GOOD. A couple of vegetarian friends and I were super excited to try one of the only vegan restaurants in the Princeton area, and we were not disappointed! The cafe is located in the corner of a farmer's market (which was adorable) and the staff was super nice. We tried the Vibs sandwich, cheesesteak, and buffalo chikin sandwich, all of which we absolutely loved. All three sandwiches came with sweet potato chips, which were good as well (tasted almost BBQ-y). The Vibs in particular are made with seitan and jack fruit--This was by far the best, meatiest jack fruit I've ever had. My friends said that their cheesesteak and buffalo chikin sandwich tasted like turkey. I am fully planning on becoming one of Savory Leaf Cafe's regulars--Go try it, you won't regret it!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Pete's Clown House should be a regular stop for me. I will be back for the food and the atmosphere. Great job!You must try the fried chicken sandwiches, the mac and cheese is amazing and the service is amazing. I will be coming back again and again. The food was amazing and the prices were very reasonable! I will definitely be coming back! I had the pork chops and it was great. The pork was tender and flavorful. The sides were a good portion for the price. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good and the lobster was just right. The service was really good. I would recommend this place to anyone."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I wish I could them more than just say thank you for opening a place for the local community. I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little spicy but the flavor was good. The burrito was a little bland but it was just what I expected. I would go back. I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the red beans and rice. They have a great selection of beers on tap."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I think this place is a little too expensive, but I will say that it's a pretty good place to eat. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you're hungry, you might have to wait a bit longer for your food. I would recommend coming here on a weeknight if you are looking to dine in. I used to love this place. I always get the shrimp dumplings. I get my shrimp fried rice. I've never been disappointed. I never feel like I'm being rushed and the staff is always friendly. I love the atmosphere."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My date and I walked into this place with a group of 7 people for a drink and appetizer. We had a great time. The drinks were tasty and the food was great. We ordered the fish and chips, the crab cake, and the shrimp and grits. The fish and chips were the best I have had in a while. The crab cake was awesome. I liked the flavor of the crab cake but I didn't like the shrimp and grits. My date ordered the shrimp and grits, which he said were great. We also ordered the crawfish etoufee, which was good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,All I really need is some more professional training and a good manager. This is the first time we've had a bad experience. The manager took the time to explain the situation and made sure we were well taken care of. I will be back for sure. I've been coming here for years. I have to say it's by far the best Chinese food I've had in a while. I've tried a few different things on the menu and always have a great experience. I've also tried a few different items on the menu and they all were great. I'm a huge fan of their chicken wings and their bbq chicken.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"You won't find ANYWHERE like this in the Tampa Bay Area.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I am a bit of a vegetarian, so it is pretty hard to find a good vegan place. I am from San Francisco, and I know what vegan food is and I know how to make it. I'm not sure if it is a lack of common sense or just something I can't figure out. Maybe they have some other unique vegan dishes, but I can't say I've ever been disappointed.

The service is great, the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. I have had some bad experiences here, but"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm not sure what made me so excited the first time I came here and how I gave this place 5 stars. 

Today, I ordered the same thing I ordered the last time: the California omelette with potatoes and an English muffin. A ""staff favorite"" and also vegetarian. 

It was...meh. I felt like I had to add a lot of hot sauce and salt and pepper to give it some flavor. 

Our service was great and the food was delivered very quickly. But, given that there were hardly anyone in the restaurant, I wouldn't expect anything less. In prime breakfast time (9am), there were maybe 2 or 3 other tables total. 

Hope this place steps up its game as there are so many other, better local brunch and breakfast spots delivering around the downtown area."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"On GrubHub this place is rated higher than all of the other pizza places where we normally go (Golden Crust, Toto's, Mario's). I disagree! Waited 1 hr. & 15 minutes for delivery to arrive, at which point my panini and fries had steamed themselves into a soggy mess. I was hungry, though, so I ate half of the panini (a Cubano), which was actually not terrible, and probably would've been fine had it not gotten soggy.

My son had plain pizza, which was decent (definitely not thin crust...more like Pizza Hut, far from ""NY style.""). Mozzarella sticks were fine, though my son said the dipping sauce was too sweet.

I have to say the pizza was very cheap ($11 for an extra-large/18"" plain), so that was a good aspect. 

But I probably won't order from them again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Nitza's pizza will definitely go down as one of Alberta's finest. I can see it growing into a larger franchise. Ever since I was a kid (I'm not that old), even when there was just the one location, this was my family's 'go to' pizza. A truly unique recipe; the perfect amount of sauce, meats, cheeses, and vegetables (for the strange ones who eat vegetables). I have grown up eating Nitza's pizza and I can see myself eating it in a senior's home at one point of my life. I highly recommend the food here for anyone looking for a new place to try that will satisfy their taste buds! 
I recently moved 1 minute from the wye road location which has had negative effects on my weight,
however, the staff there are very pleasant."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I patronized Guido's a few years ago and remembered them having fabulous pizza in a weirdly Spanish atmosphere. I just went back for tapas with my mom and we loved it! We especially loved the chicken empanadas, the spicy shrimp, and man oh man the chocolate cheesecake for dessert. Best fried calamari I've had in St. Louis. Also delicious, but I forget the names were a yummy spanish cheese with fruit preserve and a goat cheese in tomato sauce tapa. I'd love to go back and try the Sangria and some of their pasta. The salads looked great too. They are the only restaurant I know of on The Hill that is open on Sundays, and you can tell they get busy after church is out. Great family place with a very extensive menu."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Visited on Friday night and the restaurant side was off limits unless reservations or private party.  Waited about 30 minutes for bar see seating.  Bar was noisier and more crowded than usual.  
We got seated far from the entrance but felt cold air rushes periodically.  Waiter was nice guy but was not very attentive.  I'll attribute to being a busy night.  Food was good; ordered toasted ravioli as appetizer.  Ravioli was so-so with a very small serving of marinara.  I had BBQ nachos and hubby ordered Philly Cheesesteak.  Nachos were tasty but meat was on the cold side.  Cheesesteak didn't look appetizing but was decsnt.  Our Friday night visit was fine and food was good; still giving my 4 stars although waiter was MIA."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Two families with two small children each (total of eight) had trouble finding a suitable table at KPot. The tables seem to fit parties of 4 or 6 only, so there was a lot of confusion from the staff as to where to seat us.

Hot pot or BBQ? Pick your poison. It's hard to enjoy both since its AYCE. We went with the hot pot. There is a lot of variety of items to eat including blue crab and your standard options. We did find ourselves having to ask twice for certain items. There is a sauce bar with every sauce and spice you'll need to make the perfect dipping sauce.

I didn't try the Korean BBQ, but it looked very good. There is a fruit and salad bar with a few odd ""desserts' as well."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Disclaimer: Not just a coffee shop. The coffee is good but it's also a small shop and doesn't look like much. I don't understand how the employees are so rude and go around taking orders. The staff is very nice. I appreciate that they are short staffed but I don't think they are the most professional. They are a little over priced but I would give them a try. I will be back. This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good. I got the red snapper, and it was good. The bread was good."
Restaurants,5.0,CG,"Places like this are why I love the place.  I will say that the food was pretty good.  The drinks were also good.  The place was clean.  I would definitely go again.  It's a little pricey for what it is.  But you get what you pay for.  I highly recommend it.I had the crab cake with a side of pastries and my husband had the pork chop with ham and bacon. I thought the pastries were better than the pastries, but I'd be willing to try the pork chop again. They were both very good. The ham and bacon were really good, too. I would definitely go back"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I have had a few issues with the food and service but overall I enjoyed my experience. The food is delicious. The fries are crispy, seasoned, and great. The burgers are good. The fries were good, not as thick as I like them to be. The mixed greens were a little tough to eat and I did not have much flavor. The burger was great. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I will be back. This is a great place for lunch or dinner. The service is great, the food is delicious, and the prices are very reasonable. The portions are generous, and the food is always fresh."

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The quality at Rybread has gone down hill. The food is not that great. The pastries are not the best. There are better cheeses in the area. The service is terrible. The food is horrible. If you come to Rybread you should visit the aisles or the deli. I would not come back. We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed. The food was delicious, and the service was great. I would highly recommend the fried chicken, as it is one of my favorite dishes. We also ordered the steak and it was great, especially with the mushroom soup."

I had the pork chops and I was quite surprised by the portion size.  The pork was very tender, and the sauce was very spicy.  I'm not sure if I liked the sauce more than the meat, but it was still very flavorful.  My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits, which he"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,My boyfriend and I went here for lunch because we saw they had a great lunch special online. I got the spicy tuna roll which was pretty good but definitely didn't look as fresh as the beautiful photo posted by another reviewer. My boyfriend got a salmon roll and he said it was so fishy he couldn't even finish eating it. On top of that there was some confusion about whether he wanted avocado on his roll or not so that was definitely our fault in the ordering HOWEVER they upcharged a dollar per roll for it without telling us. I completely understand upcharging but at least have the courtesy to give us a heads up to see if it is worth the extra cost to us.  Overall I don't think we will be returning.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food is decent, but over-priced.  After two meals, two beverages, and the tip, it was $40 for two people... for two bowls of noodles and broth.

The food wasn't bad by any means, but it was definitely something I could have made at home just as good for way less money.  

Also, it is kind of weird that the place is run like a QSR... you go in, order and pay first, then wait for them to call out your number.  Then you have to sit at community-style tables, which does not work well for a big guy like myself.

If I am going to spend $20 per person, I would want sit-down restaurant service and food that I can't do better myself.  All-in-all, I just wasn't impressed, especially for the price point."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I finally tried this place after two years of driving by and here's the reasons I won't go back:
They have Pepsi 
No free soda refills 
Bottle of beer is $4.70
Extra chips and salsa is $1.89

Food was ok but the rice was hard and over cooked. Service was ok until I put my card out to pay. I watched the waitress socialize with a table while they were reading the menus then she took their drink order then she brought them drinks then took their order all while we were sitting there two tables away. They were not busy as only three tables were taken including us. Finally had to wave down the other waitress so we could pay. Now I know why it wasn't busy and I will keep going to Mi Casa. Sorry I tried."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"amazing atmosphere - not so great food = maybe try it again?  maybe not?

Came here recently with my boyfriend.  The inside is amazing and we immediatly fell in love with the decor.  The menu is super small so there were only 2 things we could order as vegetarians.  I got the veggie tacos and I just didn't think they were that good.  There wasn't a lot of flavor and they were pretty greasy.  The chips and salsa were ok but super small and the chips were obviously homemade as they were super super greasy.  That being said they were our favorite thing.  

We really wanted to like this place but we left hungry and unsatisfied.  We will give it another try and see if things get better."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"The only thing I have tried here are the pupusas and the horchata. The pupusas are pretty good. It's actually the first place in Philadelphia that I have found after searching for years since I am Salvadoran and from NJ where these restaurants are found in abundance. The horchata does not taste as good as the original Salvadoran horchata. It tastes too sweet, thick, and has a strong taste of chocolate.

The restaurant is very small and only has about six tables for seating. It's actually cramped. As of the day of this review it is a cold December day and there appears to be no heat inside the restaurant. Besides these things, I will continue to come back since the pupusas are decent and since it's the only restaurant in Philly that makes and sells them."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"To the point.... the bowl and smoothies I ordered were yummy!  But that was after I finally got them.  I waited '50' minutes to get my order.  It was 2pm so not the typical rush-hour but 50 minutes to get 2 standard items?  They could've been understaffed, no idea, but customers were grumbling and 2 asked for a cancel/refund because they couldn't wait any longer and had to get back to work... which created another issue because the cashier didn't know how to 'refund' ... it was almost comical to watch.
Honestly this is the 2nd time I've been to this BB and the first time I waited almost 30 minutes.  :(   Sad part was there was not one 'Sorry for the wait', or 'Thank you for waiting'....  poor."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"My wife & I come here often and the food is good. However, the service has been terrible so we had to ask for refills on drinks and food. I had to ask for a glass of water twice in a row. My wife & I ordered the churros, 2 tacos, & the pollo al pastor. All of our food was extremely dry & had no flavor. We were all extremely disappointed. We will never come back. We had a party of 6 and the service was absolutely horrible. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for our food and we were told that they didn't have any specials."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"The older white haired man (I think the owner?) was rude and unprofessional. He said we had a reservation and he would be right with us if we wanted to go. He was clearly annoyed and didn't care. I will never be coming back to this location.Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this is by far the best. The salmon with the macaroni and cheese is one of the best I have ever had. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good and the lobster was seasoned well. My friend had the pork chop with rice and beans. The pork chop was very good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"everything was going great until we were told by the hostess that we could not sit down and we had to wait. The hostess said that she would be right back to bring us our food. We sat down in the dining room for about 15 minutes and our food was brought out with no apology. We ended up going to the bar and got the mahi tacos and the red fish tacos. The fish tacos were decent, nothing special. The red fish tacos were very dry. The red fish tacos were very good, nothing spectacular. I would definitely come back again.We had a great time here and we will definitely be back! We had the spicy chicken and the chicken spring"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I recently moved to Rockville and I was looking for a place to eat for the first time. I read the reviews and I was excited to try the Treme. The food was ok, the service was not. The waiter was very nice. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I did get the crab claws and they were a little salty. I didn't mind the salt, but I think the crab claws were a little overcooked. The sauce was good, but it wasn't great. I liked the garlic butter sauce, but I didn't like the flavor of the garlic butter. The shrimp and grits were great, but I did"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The service was unusually good. We had the crab cakes which were a nice size for the price and we shared an order of fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. The crab cakes were cooked perfectly and the bread was good. 

The service was friendly and the food was delicious. The prices are a bit high for the quality but overall the experience was excellent. I'd go back just for the food and drink.We were on a road trip and needed a quick lunch before we headed to Nashville. The location is great, but the service was awful. We got the red snapper, and the short rib that came with it. The short rib was undercooked"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My husband and I came here about 5 years ago and had a few tortas, drinks and the queso con chorizo... I raved about the queso for years! This year, we were shopping in the area and I thought, 'i need that queso!'. We stopped in right before the dinner rush. We got a seat right away and the staff was super friendly! The drinks were great! We ordered the queso and chips. It arrived pretty fast and the chips seemed a litte.... old... the chorizo in the dip tasted amazing but the consistency of the cheese was like if you melted a cheese single in the microwave and let it sit a little.... not great. But its a great place to stop for a meal? and to get out of the sun and have a drink!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Ate there with my husband and son. Their meals were good. Son got rabbit pasta. Very good flavor but the portion was small and no other side dishes were included. Husband got the chicken pot pie. It was tasty. Came with a flaky crescent like pasty not the usual pie crust. Also had a side of green beans. I ordered the lobster Mac. Apparently they ran out of lobster but the server didn't know this until the other two entrées were ready to be served.  So I ordered a salad thinking it would be quick, and got it when my son and husband were finishing their meals. Had to ask to speak to the manager. Even then all she did was comp the salad - which wasn't that great anyway. Neat atmosphere, but won't be back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,My first time at Toma. Had a reservation in advance and came in on a busy Saturday night. Unfortunately we got an awfully crowded seat to the right of the door for two. Although I understand they are trying to fit in as many people as possible this is not adequate seating especially considering how expensive the food is. Regardless of this we really enjoyed our food. For a starter we had the grilled octopus. Presentation was beautiful and the flavor was incredible!! The black spaghetti is definitely the perfect pasta dish if you love seafood. I  was very impressed with my meal and would love to come back so long as the seating situation is better. Overall this is a great spot for a special occasion dinner considering the location right next to the beach.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"If you are looking for really slow service from a waitstaff that could not care less about your dining experience, then Bistro is the place for you! Stopped by on a sunny Sunday afternoon and about half the tables were full outside. Couches were empty and there were four people at the bar. So you can certainly understand why it would take to over 20 minutes to get our first drink, right? And here is the thing - they are VERY consistent; the service is absolutely terrible every time I have been there. Good bye Bistro - I really wanted this to work out between us. You have great outdoor seating, and pretty good wings. But it's in your service where you show me that deep in your heart, you really don't give a crap about me."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is awesome and totally one of a kind in the area. Don't come here expecting sushi, but you will find awesome Japanese food you won't find anywhere else in the greater Philly area! 
On the market side, you can get so much tasty things and a cute and expanding selection of housewares, toys and other office things. Be warned though- it's very small, like smaller than a Wawa. 
On the restaurant side you'll find Japanese comfort food like from a Japanese diner. Udon noodle soup, mild Japanese style curry with fried pork cutlet, or thinly sliced beef and sweet onions over rice. Wash it down with one of the dozens of flavors of delicious Japanese soda. While the food isn't the best I've ever had, it beats anything else you can get in the area."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"1.5 stars in my book. We had the crab cakes which were a nice size for the price and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was crispy and seasoned just right. The crab cakes were a little hard and the gnocchi was a little too salty for my taste. The breading was a little tough to eat and it was a little too greasy for my liking. The service was great and the restaurant was clean and the decor was great. We will definitely be back.We have been eating here for the past year, and the service has been slow. I usually go for the lunch buffet but today I went for lunch. The food was great, but"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,A hearty desayuno with some roasted sweet potato chips and a few cold drinks. The best part of the meal was the burrito. The burrito is huge and tasty. The tortillas were cooked perfectly and everything was fresh. I would come back for the burrito.The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the lamb gyro and it was excellent. I also had the chicken tikka masala which was delicious. The portion size was perfect and the price was right. I would highly recommend the tikka masala.This place is great!  We had a great meal here.  The food was amazing.  The only thing we did
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Sometimes you read the stories here, you know the food is good. But, the food is just average. The drinks are also mediocre. 

I think the place is pretty nice. They have a few TVs, which is nice. I would come here again.Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this is by far the best. The service is very attentive and friendly. The food is excellent. I would recommend this restaurant for a quick bite to eat, quick lunch, or a quick dinner. I recommend this place to everyone.Just found a new favorite pizza place in Philly.  They have a wide variety of pizza"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Beef Sandwich. Tri-tip seared with a sweet and sour pickle.

Dessert:

- Chocolate chip cookie. Delicious.
- Chocolate chip cookie with a chip. 
- Chocolate chip cookie with a sour pickle. 

I really enjoyed my meal and would definitely recommend it to anyone!One of the best restaurants in the city! I had the pork chops and it was great. The pork was tender and flavorful. The shrimp and grits were delicious. The service was friendly and helpful. The decor is very modern and very comfortable. I would definitely come back and recommend it to anyone.I have been going here for over 10 years"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Went in to try the BBQ wings and they were just ok. 

The wings were cooked perfectly and the sauces were spot on. 

I think the place is pretty cool with a lot of potential. 

I also wish they had more tables. The staff seemed more like they were just taking the time to make sure everything was going well. 

We will be back.Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch, but the food was absolutely delicious! We had the crawfish etouffee and the fried crawfish. The etouffee was amazing and the crawfish were perfectly cooked"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm so glad you Yelpers steered me to Zayna!  I was really impressed.   I've been on a serious Mediterranean food kick lately.  This means I've sampled lots of restaurants in the past few months and I can say that Zayna ranks up there with the tops.

The falafel was near perfect.  It was served nice and warm and was crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked (not doughy) on the inside.  The other standout was the baba ghanoujh.  Wow!  I don't think I've tasted better.  It was delicious.  I also loved the hummus and the warm pita bread.  Heck, that was the whole meal!  I cleaned my plate.

I hope this restaurant does well.  They offer really good food and friendly service.  I'd love to return."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The facts: 
RESERVATIONS ARE POINTLESS
Made a reservation for 7:45 pm
Arrived promptly at 7:45 pm 
Were seated at 9:05 pm
Asked for a free appetizer and the request was ignored 

The restaurants main problem: 
They seat walk-ins without anticipating their next reservation. THIS IS SIMPLE MANAGEMENT SKILLS. It blows my mind that they do not know how to do this or implement it. I would LOVE to inform management on how to run the restaurant. 100% of the complaints about this restaurant are about their poor service.

Also if you wait a long time (30mins to over an hour) to be seated or for your food, do not expect to get a complimentary appetizer, meal or anything. 

If you have a large group of people this is NOT the restaurant for you.

The food was great though and the waitress was apologetic."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Comfort food done well, and a beer selection to delight your inner (or outer) beer snob.

The happy hour specials are some of the best deals around. $2 carnitas? Yes, please. I'd be all over that even if they weren't delicious. Fortunately, they are, and two of those babies makes a meal. Throw in a beer or two, and you can have dinner for like 10 bucks. The nachos should not be overlooked, either. They, too, are 1/2 price during HH, and there is a veritable mountain of them.

Did I mention they have a late-night happy hour from 12-2 as well? And that the kitchen is open until 1:30 every night? And that they do an awesome brunch (challah!) ?

The downside to all this winning is that it gets paaacked. But whaddya gonna do. (Answer: shut up and drink!)"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I tried this place for the first time on Friday night. First of all, it was pretty warm in the restaurant. You could tell they had air conditioning, but it just didn't circulate well at all. It was sticky and uncomfortable.

I had the Not So Big Daddy. They suggested I have it cooked Med, which I would have ordered anyway. It came out Med Well to Well. I found it to be pretty bland tasting as well.

My BF had the pork sandwich. The sauce was some sort of apple bbq flavor and it was really really good. The pork was just okay.

Sadly, it was the tater tots that were the star here. Seasoned and cooked to perfection.

There is really nothing that would draw me back to this place. There are too many other great burger choices in town."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"A group of us are employed from a clinic across the street we walk over a lot because it's the fastest to get food before we come back to see patients. 
Not only has it happened once twice or three times. It's happened more than that, our orders are always always wrong. We've had to walk back to the restaurant to pick up the food they've forgotten. They over charged a slushy! Worse thing of it all is that we were asked to wear a mask while half of the employees there weren't wearing one ESPECIALLY IN THE KITCHEN. Meanwhile the lady that asked is wasn't even wearing one. They're Loby is open and open to the public, tell me how the heck were suppose to eat with a mask on. This is probably the WORST experience ever."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I liked this location much better than the one we went to in Reno, Reno. The service was fast and friendly. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only downside was that the parking lot was a bit on the narrow side.This was our first time coming here. We were looking for a quick dinner and we found the restaurant right on the beach. We got there around 4:30 and it was packed. The waitress was friendly and quick to serve us. We got our food quickly and were very pleased. I had the wings and my husband had the ribs. We both had the ribs and loved them. The ribs were tender and juicy. The sauce on the ribs"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Go there. Now. Like, drop some money and go somewhere else.

And, I'm pretty sure that's how the food is, because it's the best chicken in town.I'm not sure why this place gets 5 stars, but it's definitely not worth it. The food is always a bit overpriced, the servers are always rude, and the food is so overpriced that I just can't get over it. But if you want some good food, this is the place for you.Amazing food, the staff is friendly, the prices are great, and the atmosphere is great. The portions are huge, and the food is amazing. They have a wide variety"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I was excited when I saw this place on the menu but it was only a couple of hours from my house.  The food was delicious and the staff was friendly.  I will definitely be back.  It was a very busy night and I would recommend to anyone.Great food, great service. 
The food is always good and the service is always excellent. 
We love the salads, the specials, the dessert and the desserts. 
This is a great place for a romantic date or a date night. 
The service is always excellent and the atmosphere is great. 
If you like great food and a relaxed atmosphere, this is the place for you!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,This was my third time here. The food was ok but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We were looking forward to eating here and it was not worth the wait.I've been here several times and have had great experiences.  The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.  The staff is friendly and quick with your order.  I'm not a huge fan of the red beans and rice but the mac and cheese is delicious.  I can't wait to come back. 
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Visited on 7/19/12. My co-workers and I were greeted by a very friendly and welcoming waitress. We ordered the gnocchi, the Chicken parm and the chicken sandwiches. Everything was very tasty. We also had the bread pudding. I would highly recommend this place. I visited the restaurant for the first time. I was really impressed. I had the crab cakes and I think they were the best I've ever had. I highly recommend it! The service was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant for any occasion. Best service I've had in a long time. We went on a Thursday night and we were seated immediately."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"""Dive bar"" doesn't explain this.  The food is good but it's also not the best.  I had the burrito and it was good but the flavor was not great.  The service was okay and the place is a little dirty.  I'd rather spend my money at a nicer place.  I will not return.I had the crab cake with a side of pastries and my husband had the pork chop with ham and bacon. I don't know if I'm being generous or what, but I'd say the food was okay. I was disappointed with the pork chop and the ham and bacon. The pastries were a little too sweet for my liking"
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Sitting here today at the Tampa Stadium Location (#03838) and just received my food.
I placed an order in the drive thru and was told to pull up to the VIP spot.
Waited waited and waited so more. 
Business for this location was extremely slower than normal today (assuming due to the local events and festivities this weekend ) - SO NO REASON TO WAIT AS LONG AS I DID!
I had to walk in and ask about my order
At that time the manager on duty somewhat disappeared behind the wall (gotcha!) and everyone looked around as though they had never received an order at all never mind that the VIP 1 spot is in OPEN VIEW. 
So today you receive an - UNPROFESSIONAL POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE RATING SMH
(Nothing is free..... this was a PAID order and I am a CUSTOMER )"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Stepping into the Lingnan was like stepping into a time machine that took me back to the ""fancy"" Chinese restaurants my family frequented for special occasions (like Christmas Eve) when I was a kid.  From the decor to the waiters' attire to the flavours in the Lingnan punch, it took me back to the giddy excitement I felt at ""eating out"" as a kid.

No, the cuisine is not contemporary Chinese.  Nor is it authentically traditional.  But it's very good Westernized Chinese fair like you could get at the ""fancy"" places in the 1970's and 1980's (so much better than the Westernized Chinese you get in the buffet places these days).  

I was giddy the whole time I was there.  Probably because everything about the place made me think that the next day was Christmas."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I ordered food from this place today for the first time and I was disappointed with the food. I ordered Chicken Parm and I was not impressed. I am picky about my Italian and this just did not sit well with me. I am particular about the taste of the red sauce used, whether home made or not, this dish had more crushed tomatoes than an actual sauce. The chicken had no red sauce on it at all, and there was way to much pasta with the dish and very little sauce for the entire dish. I threw away about 60% of my food because there was a huge amount of pasta, very little to no sauce and the chicken was mediocre at best. Considering the competition for Italian food in this area, I would not recommend this restaurant."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place used to be amazing but the service has declined the past few visits and tonight was my final visit for sure. After mixing up our table from the beginning, slowest service I've ever had, my girlfriends steak was frozen in the center, after sending it back for another, the second steak was also frozen! Absolutely terrible! Last time I ever go there. 

Update: I gave this place one more chance a year later, guess what? They totally failed again but 10 times worse. Broken glass in one of the drinks, orders were all wrong, one of the steaks was literally a blob of fat, ate the entire meal with no drinks because of incompetence. Too many issues to list and the manager didn't care. Never again! You have been warned. They need to go out of business"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Food was very fresh and I liked that it was made to order. We are vegetarian however and the options are very limited. Basically you can get anything but only with grilled vegetables. They were bland and we paid the same price as if we had gotten steak. Some meat alternatives (i.e. Seitan, mushroom/avacado or soy) would be nice. You can only eat grilled veggies so many times, we won't return. The girl behind the register was a bit abrupt about clearing our own table, you can't really tell it's bus yourself. The guy who is probably an owner was very nice though.  Good place for a casual meal if you eat meat I guess but avoid if you're vegetarian. I know we're a small group but hey, we make up almost 9% of diners now : )"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,We stopped in at midnight and they happily seated us & told us to take our time ordering.  I understand they close at midnight but they kept seating diners after us.  The service was top notch...my husband & I both loved the Knights on Horseback appetizer.  I had the Blackened Shrimp Caesar salad & hubby had the club sandwich which was really a turkey sandwich on a croissant.  He said the sandwich was very good a good size. We both were hoping to have room for some pecan pie...but were so stuffed we told the waitress we'd have to pass.  She brought us our check and when she returned with our change she wrapped up a piece of Pecan pie for us & told us to enjoy it for breakfast...and that's what we did!!!
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I love this place, simply put. The food is amazing, the drinks are great, and the staff is so friendly. The place is small and small, but the food is amazing. We go here every couple of months, and it's one of the few places that we've never been disappointed. The place is also the most convenient place to get a drink at the bar, and it's always great to get a drink with friends! The bartenders are always super friendly and will help you out if you need something, and they will let you know when you need something!

You can't go wrong with this place, especially if you're not in the mood for a dive bar"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and finally decided to try it for the first time last night.  The food was great, the service was great and the atmosphere was very chill.  The only complaint I have is that it was a little loud and the food was not that great.  I will say that the servers are very attentive and the place is very clean.  I will definitely be coming back and recommending to all my friends and family!I have been here twice and both times I was very disappointed with the service. I ordered a gyro, which is supposed to be gyro meat but it is mostly meat. The meat was not as flavorful as I had hoped"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,It's cute & quaint. The food is amazing. We love this place!Very good. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little tough to eat and it was very chewy. I think the pork was dry and had a burnt taste. I think it was just too much sauce. I would not go back for that. My wife's pork was cooked very well and she enjoyed it. They have a very good selection of beers. We had a great time. We will be back.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I went here for restaurant week. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to New Orleans again I would suggest to try this place out. I would give it 3 stars only because the food was good but the service was terrible.I was there for brunch and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  I got the vanilla coffee and it was really good!  The decor was beautiful and the staff was very friendly.  I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  It is a fun place to

I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were very good. 

The service was great and very prompt. The place was clean and well maintained.We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed.  I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the clam chowder.  I loved both and our meals were just right.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We looked forward to this place opening for a long time. Tha taco creations are pretty unique and not what you'd find at average establishments. That said, they really did not blow me away. Sometimes I feel that basic is best when it comes to tacos. I normally went with their already made options because I didn't trust my own choices to pair correctly. Overall, they were decent, just not my thing. The dips are great, we have normally went after the trio with salsa, queso, guac. 

One last thought - the margaritas.  We were pretty bummed that such an aesthetically appealing place made their margaritas with bottle mix. This generally makes them way too sour and taste too much like a child's sugary drink. I think that I'd give it another shot if they'd switch up the margaritas."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"**400th review**

Amazing. Everything we ate was perfect. Our app, drinks, entrees and dessert were outstanding. The Berkshire Tomahawk Pork Chop was so tender and flavorful! I took a bite of my boyfriend's elk and it was just as good. 

This was our final dinner on our cross-country road trip and it was the best that we encountered. The interior decor is beautiful; we both fell in love with the blue wall and all of the little touches throughout the restaurant. We sat by the large windows and pretty much had the place to ourselves (4:30 p.m.) on a Tuesday evening. What a wonderful way to end an amazing trip. 

The chef came out to talk to us about one of the sides we were curious about. The service was great. But overall--I will remember that meal for a long time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My failed attempt to experience John's Roast Pork brought me to Tony Luke's. The line was far out the door in the hot sun, but I have no issue waiting for awesomeness. I ordered the standard cheesesteak w/ sharp provolone, grilled onions, and sauteed mushrooms + a side a fries, which was over $10 I recall. It was a big sandwich, and the fries were pretty good, but the steak was pretty dry and didn't have a lot of flavor. Plus I like mine chopped, and this was folded, making the dryness even more noticeable.

Perhaps how busy it was had an impact, but I'm guessing they're busy often. I will say that the service was fast and had their A game going on. I'm no Philly native, but I'm sad to say I think I've had better outside of Philly."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came into Philly for a few hours to see the sites and walked into this place based on other yelpers and that it was in the area of town we were in. 

Great fries - in fact as we were parking a woman came up to us and, unsolicited, indicated great fries.  Each fry order comes with a choice of dipping sauce - I took the curry - it was okay.  The mango one was okay but I'm sure there are others that are much better.  It's not a big place but it's cozy to sit and eat.  I don't eat french fries too often but these were worth it.  You could make the fries alone a meal.

The wrap was good - I had buffalo chicken - the sauce was spicy but not too spicy."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"DE-LICIOUS...I came with my friend Friday night. We didn't have a reservation so we had drinks at Cantinas across the street for about an hour before they called us. We ordered the brussels sprouts, which were incredible: crispy, not soggy, delicious sauce. The Pork Bao was different than any one I've had before, but incredible. The lamb rolls--can't say enough! The soup dumplings?! Phenomenal taste. The black vinegar they recommended was an amazing compliment to the dumplings. And finally the dessert: the chocolate cinnamon soft serve, it was the best way to finish the meal. We had champagne, which was the drink special for the night. I cant say enough about this place. 

TIPS: make a reservation or be prepared to wait
Ask your server for the must haves on their menu (they know best)
Eat all of the sauces...all of them."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Well. you get what you pay for and the food is good. The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The fries are thick, not crispy. It's a fryer. The portions are large. The fries are a bit small for what you pay for. They are a little pricey. They are just a few fries. That's it. The fries are all a little greasy. The burger is good, but I'd be willing to pay extra for extra cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onion. The customer service was decent. I don't know why."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I wanted to like this place. The food was good but it was also a little overpriced. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was pretty good. The chorizo was a bit thick. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I did get the guacamole which was good. I will say the service was pretty slow. I think the waitress was doing her best to make sure we were taken care of. It's not like she was really busy. I would say she just didn't know what she was doing. I really liked the food but I would have liked to get the guacamole
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Great place to go for a quick bite. Great prices too. Also, great service!I've been coming here for years. The food is always fresh and tasty. The staff is always friendly and attentive. It's a great place for a quick lunch or dinner.The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the Beef and Rice and it was excellent. I also had the chicken and waffles and it was great! The waffles were a little dry and the sauce was spicy but it was still good.

Restaurants,2.5,CG,Extremely unpleasant experience. The place was packed and the food was mediocre at best. The server was rude. We had to ask for the check before we could order. We had to ask again for it. We ordered the salmon and grouper sandwich. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the grouper was very good. I will not be returning.I ordered a hamburger medium rare. I was very disappointed. The burger was cold and the fries were cold. It's very disappointing.I've been to this place a few times.  I love the food.  They have a very good variety of beers.  I have had some bad experiences here.  The bartender is very nice and
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We were looking forward to this place and thought we would give it a try. I was disappointed. We ordered the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked to order and the chorizo was extremely chewy. I don't know how this place gets a 2 star because I ate most of the food. The rice was tasteless and the beef was just ok. The guacamole was on the salty side. I would not recommend this place to anyone.Best service I've had in a long time. 

We went on a Friday night and we were seated quickly. The food was delicious. I had the chicken tacos, which were delicious"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This restaurant is hype at best. The food is just ok. The service is terrible. If you go here for the food you will not be disappointed.I have been to this restaurant twice now and both times the food was amazing. The first time I had the shrimp and grits with crawfish etouffee. I was very disappointed. The grits were tasteless and the crawfish etouffee was not even half as good. The shrimp and grits were so dry that it was almost like they were made out of a can. They were so salty I couldn't eat them. The crawfish etouffee was okay, but the shrimp and grits were so salty I couldn't"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"So I'm assuming we all know that Jets is the best chain pizza and that this review is just based on the specific location. Haha - I grew up in Michigan near the very first Jets so maybe I'm biased. Anyways, I see a lot of negative reviews here and figured I'd chime in because I've never had a problem at this location! I just went the other day to pick up my online order and everything was perfect. After reading the reviews here I was going to double check that they included the sauce I paid for, but I saw the lady grab it. When I got home and opened the box, there was already a sauce in there so I actually got double. I haven't gotten delivery from this location but picking up has always been accurate and fresh!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We liked The Oyster Bar, but had to give it only 3 stars.  The service.  We were seated quickly at a cozy high top table.  And then waited.  And waited.  Had to go and find our server.  He was very apologetic and gave us 2 mimosas for our wait.  Our food came promptly.  I had a shrimp po' boy and my lady had a grouper sandwich.  Both were excellent.  The fries were exceptionally well done and seasoned to perfection.  The slaw was also great - slight smoky taste and a little after-kick.  Really enjoyed the meal.  And then we waited.  And waited.  Seems he forgot about us a second time.  This is a cool place with great food, but c'mon, how about some decent service?"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My wife and I ate here for our 42nd Wedding anniversary. There was a very nice card waiting at our table from the restaurant signed by many people and that was a crowning touch. Actually it was the best part of the experience. 

The food was okay but way overpriced. The service was good except I had to flag down a server to get a refill of tea. Most of the staff was busy hovering over Gov. Lee's table. The ambiance was not romantic at all. Way too loud. We came here for a nice, quiet romantic dinner, instead we got several tables of loud, intoxicated and obnoxious patrons. 

Also, the valets need to understand what valet service means. It does NOT mean standing around texting and listening to their Iphones. 

We will NOT be back. Go to Jimmy Kelly's instead."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is my second time trying this place out, and so far it's my favorite out of the other few boil places I have tried. I do not suggest ever sitting at the outdoor section as it faces the busy street of allisonville. The inside looked clean and well put together. I ordered the combo number B, which includes 1/2 crab legs, 1/2 shrimp no head, 1/2 crawfish and corn/potato. I chose to go with the juicy special sauce and do medium heat. The heat was perfect for me, however if you prefer your food a bit more on the spicy side, I suggest going with the hot.  Over all, food was great and service was great as well. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the price is a bit high for a seafood boil."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Stopped in a while back with my wife to try someplace different. I've really wanted to stop in for quite some time. The food is good for pub grub but not portions big enough for me (I love to eat after all). The food was delicious and creative though. Let's face it though really your not coming in here for a coffee and toast. It's a family friendly lounge during the day after all. The beer is made in the same establishment and it was outstanding!  OUTSTANDING!!! Tired a flight and the ""Afternooner"" is a beer that has stuck with me ever since. I make my own and would truly love to make that one. Hands down by far the best beer that I've ever tried. Anyone who likes craft beer better stop in for a pint."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Pat's or Geno's, the Philly debate!

Located a little more then a mile from the historical sites in Philly. Not really walking distance when its freezing and you are at the sites or in downtown. The area was kind of sketch when I was there too.

Street parking. Really touristy and crowded.

Cash only. Open 24/7. Outside seating, not to clean.

Be ready for long long lines. Food does comes out pretty quick though. Made to order.

Make sure you know what you want before you get to the window and order correctly. The locals and employees will give you shit.

Love the pepper condiments. Helps add heat to the sandwich.

Cheesesteak - $10 - Dry steak and bread. Provolone was the only good part. The peppers on the side helped a little but was just to dry. 

Expensive, decent sandwich, but a tourist trap. Pat's was better."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Are you kidding me? A little pricey, but worth it.

The cheese steak was awesome. It was not the best I've had, but the flavor was spot on. The cheese steak was cooked perfectly and the cut was perfect. The best part was the fries. The fries were crispy and crispy.

We ordered the loaded fries, and they were excellent. I got the burger medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. The burger was loaded with cheese, so if you want to get full on a burger, you will need to get it medium rare.

I ordered the lunch special, and it was absolutely delicious. The mushroom soup was also very good, and I had the"

The food is good. The drinks are good, but the service is not great. I've been to many other chains and this one is a bit better. I don't know how many people love it. I think it's safe to say that I won't be returning. We had a great experience here. Food was great, service was great, and the service was great. Our waiter was very attentive. I had the gyro, which was delicious. I had the pork belly, which was okay, but the meat was not to my liking."

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"So I was on the way home from a business trip and needed a snack and a cold one.  It was midafternoon.  As I was going by the crab fries were calling me and I whipped into the lot.  I remembered that this location was formally a Ninety Nine but the remodel is quite nice.

I sat at the bar and ordered the requisite crab fries and a draft.  I chatted with a friendly bartender for the short wait before the fries arrived.  Out came a huge portion and they were hot and fresh and crispy and of course they were served with the two tubs of cheese sauce for dipping.  They were too many for me to finish but they sure were tasty.

It was a short visit but it was a typical suburban sports bar experience."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If the chips were just a bit tastier, Jalisco would get my 5th star!  I adore the carnitas, my sister loved the shrimp cocktail and Baja -like atmosphere, my bro in law thought everything was great, especially his chili relleno. Been here several times now and the service has always been friendly, efficient, helpful, and fun!  Top Shelf Margaritas are tasty and I'm looking forward to trying some other fun sounding libations now that I've actually read the drinks menu.  Best North Valleys eatery which I've discovered so far!
Trying to update my review but guess I hit the wrong button! Food is still all delish and I learned that Cadillac Margarita is the one I like, with Reposado tequila and Grand Marnier, here the Top Shelf is without the GM but some places the names are interchangeable, so ask!!"
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"I was here for a Saturday farm table  dinner and can't remember a more delightful evening.  Our hostess and server were both lovely and attentive and the food, service, and ambience were spectacular. I felt very fortunate to share the table with a great group of interesting conversationalists and there was great jazz playing in the background. I could go on at length about the food but that has been done in most other reviews so I will just note that a favorite was the seitan tips and everything was delicious. I would come here again without a doubt as often as I can arrange. I feel privileged to have miss Rachel in my city of residence her offerings are as good as her energy and both are over the top. This is a great experience which I highly recommend."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great burgers! I had the Company Burger with all the fixin's plus the addition of Nueske's Bacon. It was one of those burgers you just didn't want to end. The condiment's tasted very fresh and offered several options. I tried the classic mayo, a dash of crystal hot sauce, and the pickled peppers. None of the condiments overwhelmed the flavor of the burger in my opinion. My only ""humble"" complaint was that there were no Pale Ale or IPA option on the draft beer list. I had a Hennepin which was crisp and tasty, but lacked the hops to hold up to such a rich and delicious burger. The fries were well cooked and not overly salty and went really well with their special sauce, which tasted like a bbq sauce/mayo combo. I will definitely be returning to this Freret Street gem!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The service here was very friendly and the drinks had a healthy amount of alcohol, thus the two stars. Otherwise, it would be one star. The food was not very good at all. The spinach dip was runny, and I'm pretty sure I saw corn in it. Corn is a no for me in spinach dip. The chips served with it were stale. We both ordered the crawfish étouffée, because we just wanted a bowl of it on our last night in NOLA. It was not very flavorful and the bread served with it was tough. I added a side of red beans and rice. The beans were more like mushy pinto beans. All in all, we decided the good reviews must be because the people who eat there are drunk beyond belief and wouldn't know good food if they saw it."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The Champon Ramen didn't come as described in menu description. We received 1 shrimp and 1 piece of pork. No shiitakes, corn or tempura ginger as described. The problem was the overpowering saltiness of the broth. I think they must've reduced it too much and it definitely wasn't tasted before service. 
We asked for more plain broth to dilute. Also asked for egg to be added. I think the server didn't realize our ramen didn't come as described or he wouldn't have charged us. 
Nevertheless, the Chef adjusted our bill, which we appreciated but not necessary. We would rather have been""blown away"" with an awesome bowl of ramen. Our server did add that the Champon broth was fixed. 
We haven't given up on this place as it has massive potential. We support local restaurants and hope Ichicoro is around for a long time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My wife and I have been waiting for this place to open for some time and Hotcakes Emporium was well worth the wait!  Everything was stellar. Emily was a polite, informative and attentive server and she accommodated our special requests. Breakfast started fabulous coffee that was smooth and flavorful. I rarely ask for coffee to go but I did this time. The food was wonderful. I ordered the 2x2x2 with French toast, turkey bacon and egg beaters. Loved it!  My wife ordered the Eggs Benedict and thoroughly enjoyed it. Even the kids pancakes were fluffy and tasty and some ended up on Mom's plate. We will surely be back! 

Back Again!  I love, love, love this place. Our server Jocelyn was exceptionally attentive but not ""in our face"" constantly. The food was perfect and the coffee...I might just be addicted."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Spent a few days at Dove Mountain and had dinner at Cayton's. The food was excellent and the views were incredible. Had some nice music and they even turned the TV to the hockey match for us. The chili roasted chips were great. We loved the White Russian milk shake and the burgers. The only reason they get four stars instead of five...The bathroom was a mess with 1/3 a roll of Toilet paper for the whole bathroom. We come every year and will be back again. We had a few less than perfect things at the ritz this trip, and we come every year at this time. Our server apparently got a call from the front desk because she would have given us whatever we wanted. Service is beyond incredible and the people at the ritz always try to make it right!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,This review is only on the sandwich. Rusty's has really good Pizza every pizza I've had from every Rusty's location is tasty and flavorful. For some bizarre reason their Rustys sub has little to NO MEAT?? I've had this sandwich from all 3 locations here in SB/Goleta and the sub has a few very thin slices of salami. It's literally just a giant piece of bread and veggies. Look at my picture I tried my best to just eat it because I'm hungry but towards the end I just couldn't take it anymore. I thought maybe it was 1 location but all 3 are the same. To the Franchise owners please fix this problem this is a $9 sub ... I could care less about customer service I don't go there to hook up with the staff. I just want a decent sub..
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Simply put. B&S blew me away. It is now my go to steakhouse in the city (until I finally try Barclay Prime to see if it matches the hype). Everything about my experience was perfect and more. 

I have little to no words regarding how to describe the steak. Let's just say it was in my top 3 steaks (yes, I have a top 5) I've ever had. The other two were not in Philadelphia. 

Service was perfect. A friend and I split a bottle of wine and she came around to pour any time the glass neared empty. She knew the menu inside out. Desserts (I believe) are all made in house. 

It's obviously pricey for those who may be watching their wallet but it's worth the trip if you go. A great night all around.

Points for: Food, service, wine, everything.
No negatives."

The drinks (alcoholic and nonalcoholic) were made well well, the salatim was delicious, the fries were nice and crispy and broccolini was excellent! To top this all off was the excellent service (note that 20% is already added to the bill) and the tasty dessert! I can't say enough about that soft serve with sour cherries and pistachios, I wish I ordered more! Overall, given the opportunity, we would definitely dine here again.

We arrived during that awkward time between breakfast and lunch, but not wanting brunch, so we chose lunch instead. There wasn't a single thing that was a miss at The Boathouse at Hendry's. With consent, I picked off of everyone's items at the table. From the Fish & Chips, The Seafood Pasta, and The Chilean Sea Bass, everything was amazing. The Fish & Chips-- fried to perfection. Excellent breading, not overwhelming. The Sea Bass was a healthier option, but the fish flaked off just as easily. The mashed potatoes gave the entree a nice finishing touch."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place totally lived up to the hype I had heard from friends. The food was good, the beer selection excellent and the staff was very pleasant and friendly. 

Pierogie week was a blast. We paired several plates of pierogies with the various PBC brews they had on tap and it was outstanding. Even the dessert peirogies (yes dessert - cheery cheesecake peirogies!) were damn good.

Their selection of brews was impressive - not overwhelming but certainly much better than average. They have the standard domestics (Rolling Rock, Pabst, Yuengling, Miller), a wide variety of craft bottles including many local breweries (Troegs, Victory, Dogfish Head) and a bevy of imports from Guinness to Franziskaner. 

This is not a big place but it is cozy and friendly. And the childhood toys all over the bar back certainly liven up the place. I would highly recommend it."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"DiNic's serves one of the best roast pork sandwiches I've ever had. Add the provolone and the broccoli rabe and it's hard to beat. I've never had a bad sandwich from them. For the price the sandwich is a fairly big portion. I can barely finish my sandwich every time but it's so good I can't resist eating the whole thing in one sitting. 

There's a few stools you can sit at while you eat (if you're lucky enough to get one) or you can take your meal to go. 

This is one of the most popular places in the Reading Market but it's surprising how quick their service is. Even at it's busiest I haven't been at line for more than a few minutes.

Definitely recommend trying this place if it's your first visit to the Market and you're looking for a good sandwich."

I explained why I was calling and was asked to call back in about 15 minutes.   The individual told me she was busy doing something important. In this day of caller ID!

It's not fancy but it was a convenient walk from my hotel. There was a pretty good happy hour going when I got there and again, our server gave us plenty of lead time when we were nearing the end of the hour so we could order up.

We had a shrimp appetizer and escargot - both were good. My husband ordered a pasta dish which had both crab and chorizo. It was good but it had diablo in the name and we still had to spice it up. It was hard to taste the crab. Our dinner was fine but sort of unremarkable as I don't even remember what I ordered - another dish with chorizo."

The fried chicken was pretty good. The shrimp and grits were not very good. They were pretty chewy and hard. I felt like they were under cooked. I didn't get the chance to try the grits but they looked good. They were not very good. The only reason I gave it 5 stars

Back to these wings, AMAZING! Personally we always get 1 order dry and 1 order bbq but as long as you order an extra spicy mustard, you made the right decision! Seriously, they should sell this stuff by the gallon, I would invest!

The downside to us (maybe not you) is they don't allow anyone under 18 in the entire joint! Hence why we always pick up. The shocker is you'd think there would be availability since they can't have any young families, you're wrong. I'm pretty sure half the allure is the fact that my kids won't be yelling and throwing food around the adults? Either way this is a monthly staple in a our family!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Me and my boyfriend are from Rochester NY. So we are fine with going into the hood for good food. If you a scary person then don't go because you be uncomfortable. But if your like me and believe the best road is the one less traveled, then this you your place for a Philly steak. It's not dry as hell with no flavor. Forget all that nasty talk about chemicals called cheese wiz. GROSS! Just come here and grab a pepper cheese steak with extra cheese! Sweet peppers!! Yes! There is not a certain line order. So when you go in just ask people if they ordered yet then talk to the cook to let them
Know your there. Bar right next to the grill playing hip hop. They sell beer as well. Yes great place to eat."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Yes. Yes. YASSS!!! You need to try this place at least once in your life! Dear gawd is the food good! We got the Row Poppers and they were one of the best things that I have ever put in my mouth! They come in an order of six so I'm glad I had five people in my group because I could have eaten them ALL! A couple friends and I also split the Row Burger and the Cowboy Burger. The best addition to each burger was a fried green tomato and fresh jalapeños respectively. Both burgers were freakin' delicious!! 

The restaurant itself is also very cute and much bigger than it looks from the outside. The front room/bar area has a stage where live music is performed and you can eat at community style bar tables to meet new friends! Overall an amazing place!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm a potato snob.  I force every one I know to tell me I make the best potatoes they have ever eaten.  And I do make fantastic potatoes.  Truly.  It will be my legacy.  However,  the tater tots here are better than my potatoes.  I say that with no shame as the truth is the truth.   I ate there on the third day open with my husband.  He is hard to please and he knows to always praise my spuds above all others.  He couldn't look me in the eye and tell me that my potatoes were better than the tater tots.  He is a wise man.  They were fantastic!  The whole meal was great.  Even to the ending of butterscotch pots de creme.  This place is worth it!"
Restaurants,1.5,OR,"This location is horrible! Especially at night. My boyfriend and I decided to go thru the drive thru. We waited at the screen for a couple minutes before we could even order. When we did everything looked correct on the screen so we drove ahead. We waited in line for our food at least ten minutes! We get our food check the bag and all looks good so drive home. Get home half of our order is incorrect and the other half soggy! Drive back up there and get a refund bc at that point after waiting and dealing with poor customer service decided to go to the lemay ferry location. It was a great decision. Food at the second location was fresh, accurate, fast and hot. Long story short - don't waste your time at this location and go to the lemay ferry location."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Stopped into Cacia's for lunch. We had the Ribeye and the Mac & Cheese. The Ribeye was a little too fatty for my liking. The Mac & Cheese was a bit bland and the Mac & Cheese was just okay. I would come back for the Ribeye.The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the Beef and Rice and it was excellent. I also had the chicken and waffles and it was great! The waffles were a little dry and the sauce was spicy but it was still good. The food was great and I would come back!I'm a huge fan of the sushi, and this place is probably the best in Tucson. I've only had the prime rib"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"After searching all around on Yelp, I came across this place. The food is really good. The burrito is a solid 4 out of 5, the pork is pretty good, and the rice is really good. I ordered the seafood combo. The shrimp with shrimp was a great combination of seasoning and flavor. I also ordered the pork tacos. They were great. The pork was tender and flavorful. The shrimp were a little salty, but that's to be expected for a Mexican restaurant. I'm not a big fan of red beans and rice, but they were really good. The only thing I didn't like was the sauce."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Recently, I invited a party of eight (who were all of us) for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere was great. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was great. The menu had a lot of options. The appetizer was one of the best I've ever had. I had the fried green tomatoes, the fried catfish, and the shrimp with a salad. Everything was delicious. The service was very attentive. We were very pleased with the food. I will definitely be back to try other dishes. The decor is very fun, and the food was great!I'm a huge fan of the sushi, and this place is probably the best in Tucson. I've only had the prime rib and the shrimp"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This foodtruck is full of flavor. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the wait time. We waited over an hour for our food and then the manager came to take our order. After we had our food we walked out. The food was ok and the service was good. I would give it a 3.5 if I could.I ordered a hamburger medium rare. It came out medium well and I was able to tell it was cooked perfectly. I would not have ordered it if I could have. The burgers are good, but they need to be fresher.I ordered a lunch special from here for my friend's birthday. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it was amazing."
Restaurants,1.5,CG,"This place is a scam!!!!!!! We have been here many times and it's always a good experience every time.  The food is always good.  The drinks are always good too.  We go here every time we are in town.I've been going to this place for almost 3 years and it's always good. I've always had great service and great food. I like the cheesesteak sandwich, but I've never had anything on there that I didn't like. The cheesesteak is huge and I'd say it's worth the price for the amount of meat. The only thing that I would say is that the customer service is slow. I'm not a big fan of the other places in the"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Willie Maes fried chicken is the best we ever had. The batter is well seasoned but yet it is not heavy and it is still crispy. The Mac and cheese is a great side choice as well as the red beans and rice. The service we have had has always been good. They are very friendly and aim to please. Unfortunately Willie Mae passed away this past weekend at the age of 99 but thanks to her family her fried chicken will live on. They opened up a second location on St Charles Avenue  called Willie Maes Grocery  & Deli. They  have the famous fried chicken as well as other items not served at the original restaurant. This location might be easier for the tourists to get to. This tourist will still go to the original. RIP Willie Mae you will be missed.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was here today at about 1am and boy was i happy to find this place! It's definitely cool for some late night grub and they were bumping Kendrick Lamar which was shocking yet cool at the same time. We had hot chicken which came in tenders, and they were actually good! I had the hot and my brother had medium but we both could agree that they were hot! Not inedible hot but ""just right""spicy for me. The chicken came with plenty pickles and a tasty dipping sauce that helped cool the heat down. My brother also had a burger and it was just okay, I only took one bite but he said he has definitely had better. And his french fries were definitely too salty, we threw them away. When in Nashville if it's late night and Princes Chicken isn't open I will return!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The empanadas were our favorite appetizer. They were amazing and came with enough for 1-2 people. We also tried the mini chicken tacos which were a lot better than we expected! 

The avocado-chipotle cheeseburger was great and was made in a build your burger fashion. The avocados were fresh and the chipotle sauce was a perfect compliment to the flavor.

We also ordered the chicken fried chicken with the sausage gravy on the side. Since the gravy was on the side, the chicken tasted dryer than it would have been with the gravy. The sides (Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes) were perfect. The portions for this meal are pretty large. It wouldn't hurt to be expect leftovers if you order this.

The Mango Mule was one of the craft cocktail specials and was pretty good. The first drink tasted better than the second but it was still enjoyable."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Can I give this place 10 stars??? Honestly forgot about covid for a minute while celebrating my anniversary at F & F tonight. First of all, the bar is hands down South Jersey's finest. Every cocktail is lovingly crafted with the freshest ingredients and pride in presentation. Had the most delicious fall punch- don't miss out! Next a wonderful cheese plate followed by crab cake entree that exceeded expectations. My husband got the swordfish special. We cleaned our plates. Veggies and all. Nothing presented on your plate is an afterthought. It's all seasoned perfectly- like the best combo of comfort food and fine dining with generous portions.  Made to order cider donuts were the exclamation point on a fantastic dinner. Must mention the service is spot on. Had the best waiter who knew his stuff and made us feel welcome. Can't wait to go back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Wow!! This place was amazing! My husband and I sat at the oyster bar and got to watch Kentrell shuck oysters right in front of us! He even found a pearl in one and I got to keep it!! My husband loved the raw oysters! They were huge and the presentation was so cool!! They laid out a piece of paper on the marble counter and served the oysters right on top!! Then we tried the grilled oysters and omg!! I have never eaten oysters but these were incredible!! They smothered the grilled oysters in a butter, garlic, Parmesan, and Romano sauce that I feel in love with! The service from Kentrell was so amazing!! The raw oysters were a dollar during happy house and the grilled were $2.  We also had a few draft Blue Moons which were $3 each for happy hour! Yummmm!!"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I have been avoiding Key Lime for the last 10 years but after a few visits I decided to try it again.  The food is delicious and the staff is friendly.  I would definitely go back.  It's a little pricey for what you get but worth it.Great food, great service. 
The food is always good and the service is always excellent. 
We love the salads, the specials, the dessert and the desserts. 
This is a great place for a romantic date or a date night. 
The service is always excellent and the atmosphere is great. 
If you like great food and a relaxed atmosphere, this is the place for you!I've eaten at this location numerous times"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I'm very torn over this one. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I'm from San Francisco. This is my first time here and I don't think I'll be back.I had the crab cake with a side of pastries and my husband had the pork chop with ham and bacon. I don't know if I'm being generous or what, but I'd say the pastries were very good. The pastries were a little too salty and the ham and bacon was just a little too spicy. We were a party of four and we were all very disappointed with"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,We came to Crystal Beach for a wedding with my fiancé and we had a reservation and the place was packed.  The place was packed and we had to wait a while for our reservation.  We sat at the bar which was very nice.  The food was great and the service was excellent.  We had the fried calamari and crab cakes and they were so good.  I had the salmon with pork belly and it was cooked perfectly.  We also had the fried sweet potato fries which were very good as well.  I would definitely come back again!We had a great time here and we will definitely be back! We had the spicy chicken and the chicken spring rolls. The chicken and spring rolls were amazing.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Wasn't the best experience, but it was the worst experience. I ordered a salad, the person who ordered the salad had the same plate, and the salad had a ""good"" salad. The salad came out in a half-cup container, and the salad was obviously still warm. The salad had a very small amount of cheese and it was very over-cooked. I asked if the manager was going to refund the salad, and he said ""I don't think so"". I'm not sure if he is trying to be a jerk, or if he just doesn't care. This place is a joke. They should definitely be ashamed of themselves for having such a poor customer service experience. I'll never go back to"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I hate the outlets. Absolutely disgusting. The food is just ok. Not my favorite. I just can't get over the bad food. I also get the Tater tots and it's just not my cup of tea. I will never be coming back.I've been coming here for about a year now and I've been disappointed by the service and quality of the food. I've had my fair share of good food from here and they have always been a good value for the money. I've also had a few bad experiences with the service and the food. They just don't seem to care and the food is just not good enough to make me come back. I've had better service at other restaurants in the area
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place has phenomenal food! I've never had Cajun food like this before and have been generally unimpressed until now!! The place has great character, as well. The decor was awesome! It was everything I would imagine a New Orleans style Cajun joint to be! 
We went without a reservation and sat at the bar because that was the only open seating. The bartender didn't show up so the owner was doing double duty as the hostess while trying to maintain the bar and handle any other chaotic moment that may have arisen while managing a full restaurant during dinner rush! Impressive! As was the food! Everything we had was amazing! I sampled both the Gumbo and the Jambalaya! I was more a fan of the Jambalaya but both were awesome! Also, their house made Hurricane's are... tough and taste great too!
I will be back here soon!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I was overwhelmed by their menu plastered on the wall. Holy Moly do they have a lot to offer! Appetizers, Noodles, Soups, Poultry, Beef..etc. 

I was hoping one of the employees saw me struggling to choose an item so I can get a suggestion but no one came to my rescue. Oh well...

I went with Chicken Teriyaki and Pad Thai.
The chicken was a big portion, but it was mostly dark meat which made it scary for my 5 year old to try :( It was alright though.?

Then, when they gave me my Pad Thai...only then, they tell me that it's spicy and shouldn't share with my small children. Huh?! I wish she would have told me this while I was ordering. It was good though! 
FYI: It wasn't spicy! 

Mmm..I'm not so sure about this place yet. I think, I'll come back to give them another try..."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Decided to go out for a late dinner and a friend of mine suggested we come to canal. First off. The only Greek dish that I enjoy is the gyro sandwich/plate. So usually I avoid eating out at Greek restaurants since I limit myself only to he gyro. I of course order the gyro sandwich with the garlic and feta fries and that was amazing. The meat was very flavorful and the cucumber sauce was perfect. The fries were pretty good as well. We started our meal off with hummus and calamari. And both were good, not the best I've had. But decent enough to come back. Service was friendly, however our food took some time to come out. I'm pretty sure it had to do with the big party of 10+ girls that ordered ahead of us. Overall, this is a great place."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'd give Marbot 3.5 stars if I could. The ambience is great, love the venue! Service was great too. Decent wine list though I wish they had some California wines on there. The food, well, didn't quite live up to my expectations. I am a huge fan of Marche, where things are almost always spot on when it comes to food so I was expecting big things at Margot. I ordered a venison dish -- I know venison can be a bit tough so I ordered it rare. It wasn't rare, it was chewy. Should have been rare like I had asked. My husband's dish (can't remember what it was anymore) was just okay. I mean, I don't remember it.  For an app we had the house-made potato chips. They were okay. Hard to mess up fried potato slivers. I think Marche is a better restaurant."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I heard good things about the gyros here and I wanted to try them out but thought they were a sit down type restaurant. I went in and ordered a too go order and was surprised that it is similar to a subway/chipotle style setting. I ordered the classic  gyro. At first I was like 8 dollars for a Gyro that is crazy. It was HUGE! I mean it was so big and so filling that I could barely finish it. The only down side I didn't like was either the meat or the sauce they used was a bit overly salted. It could have been that is how gyro meat is for their location, but I just thought a little too much for me. Other than that, I will definitely be back, next time I will dine in and enjoy it than on the run."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Been wanting to try for a while and finally made it here. 

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but the food is not great.  I had the seafood platter and it was good, but nothing special.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good.  I also had the crab cakes and they were good, but nothing special.  I guess I'm used to the fact that they are a good size for the price. 

The service is good.  I've been there twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch.  I like that they have a nice bar area.  It's not a bad place for brunch, but I don't"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My family of 13 came here for the first time in two weeks. The food was delicious and we loved the music. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was fun. I would definitely go back.The best in the area. The food is always excellent and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I have never had anything I didn't like and it is a must try.We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed. The food was delicious, and the service was great. I would highly recommend the fried chicken, as it is one of my favorite dishes. We also ordered the steak and shrimp pasta. The steak was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I had the shrimp and grits and my wife"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The place is a very nice place, with lots of seating. There is a large outdoor seating area and a very nice patio. The food is very good. I had the seafood gumbo and it was good, but nothing special. I also had the short ribs with fried okra and they were very good. They also have a really nice draft beer selection. They have a nice selection of craft beers. It's very nice to have a small brewery on the corner, so you can really enjoy a beer without having to wait in line. The staff is friendly, and the place is clean. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to go."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We love Crescent City Brewhouse! We have been going there for years and have always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The drinks are always great and the staff is always friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table for three. If you are looking for a good beer and a good experience, this is the place to go.I ordered a pizza for delivery and it was awesome. It had all the toppings I could think of. I will definitely order from here again!I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. I was disappointed with the breading and the pasta. It was definitely not fresh or cooked at all. I don't know if they cooked the pasta right or if it was"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Order: Hot Golden Latte with Orange & Raspberry Juice, which was a nice amount of fruit and just the right amount of cream. I liked how they gave you a couple of different crepes that you could choose from. I would definitely go back.This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food is always good and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken sandwich. It's always delicious. The prices are fair, too. The only downside is that the service is slow, which is usually a plus.I've been here twice. The first time it was not great. It took forever to get my food and the second time it"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Tightwad Tuesdays! Which is awesome because they have a great selection of delicious beers. This was one of the first restaurants I came to when I moved to Reno, some very good friends brought me and I have been in love ever since. The beer cheese soup is addictive, the willy dillys are delicious and don't have too much batter, the mac n cheese pizza with bacon is heavenly and the sweet potato fries with Chipotle mayo is a nice change from regular fries to go with their awesome burgers. I've had their salads a couple times and the greens were fresh and add ons were a great way to spice up regular old salad. The wait staff is usually very nice, not the fastest to get your beer out but not bad, of course it's worse when they're packed but expected because the beer is so good!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We wanted to go out to eat on Friday night and I had heard about Salt Shack and thought we would try it. When we walked up to the hostess station, we were told it would be 11/2 hour wait.
No big deal. Beautiful weather and lovely  location. 
We sat at a nearby picnic table thinking we would get a drink and enjoy the scenery. As I watched people coming and going I noticed more and more people without masks on. Then the table next to us said the bartender making drinks did not have a mask on. Also, no sanitizing tables and chairs after customers left. This became very alarming.
We decided this was not good so we let the hostess know we were leaving. Such a shame.
Found another restaurant that was actually using precautions. 
Maybe the management needs to check into what is happening at this place."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Not a good experience tried to call and place the order while driving so I can have my pizzas when I arrive. There was no answer and was just left on hold. I arrive at the location explained to the server kaitlyn I was trying to place my order on the phone and was told they are to busy to deal with phone orders. I then place my order and was told my pizzas would be pushed through due to me ordering in person. 24 min after I place the order I ask the status of my food and I get attitude from the staff member saying its not ready and I just placed my order. Instead of telling me I'm sorry it will just be a few more moments. I did not enjoy the customer service nor enjoy that no manager came up to remedy the situation.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I wish this place was better.

Whenever I have friends visiting from out of town, I love to take them to the Peppermill.  With its mishmash of themes (roman columns!  neon!  glossy black walls!  rainforests! HDTV videos of nature!  A carpet patterned after a 7-year-old's bedspread!) it is quite simply the ne plus ultra of casino tackiness/awesomeness.  I love it, and my friends are rarely disappointed.

To then take them to Oceano, with its funky sea decor and overwhelming blue hue would be the cherry on top of that sundae.  Unfortunately, the fish entrees ain't that great (they were a bit dry and flavorless both times I've gone) so I can't see going back.  Why a casino restaurant can't hit the quality level of a comparably-priced chain like McCormick and Schmicks or Legal's is beyond me.  But I can always dream."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I ordered carryout on Sunday at 3 pm and was disgusted by what I saw.  I waited 25 minutes and they only had three customers. I got in line behind one customer and saw this disgusting mess.  There was food all over the counter and they had 5 employees, three of them standing around in the back.  I asked where my order was and they said they need to make another order first.  The cook grabbed the penne pasta that had been sitting against the glass and collected some of the other penne outside of the container and put it in the person's bowl.  OMG The entire counter was disgusting.  I was going to leave, but had already prepaid for the order. I can't believe I took the food home.  No one ate the food after I showed them the pictures."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I brought my girlfriend here for a birthday dinner and it was a nice dinner. I was pretty impressed with the food. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the server's attitude. He was rude and seemed to be annoyed that we were there. I was also disappointed that they did not have the option to add a dessert menu. I just didn't want to be there and that's fine because it was our anniversary. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. I was disappointed that it was a dessert. The lobster mac and cheese was good but it didn't have much flavor. I did like that the sauce on the bottom was sweet.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I'm going with a 5 star because the food is just ok. The food is good. The drinks are good, but the food is not great. I've been to many other Thai restaurants in the area, and it's not really worth it. The decor is a bit too dark, the servers are not very friendly and the food is average. I've had better Thai food elsewhere, and it's not bad. It's not great, but it's not bad. The service is good, but they don't have great Thai food. If you like Thai food, it's worth going. It's not bad, but it's not great."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"You know the place must be a dive. 

We were seated in the upstairs dining room. There was a row of tables.  The upstairs was a nice place to sit.  The table next to us had a draft beer.  I had the pretzel which was also great.  The service was great.  The food was good.  I had the Salmon cheesesteak.  It was very good.  The salmon was cooked well.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  The mushrooms were cooked perfectly.  

We had a great time and will be back.  We will be back.We stopped in for dinner. We ordered the following:

- toasted ravioli ("
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Mmmm. I can tell if it's the food or just the location. The food is good. The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty. I've been to many other bars and restaurants that I've enjoyed better. This is a great bar for a party. And they have the most beautiful patio. They also have a great wine list and a great menu of beer. I'm not sure what all the good things are about this place. The service is good. I've been there twice, and both times the server was attentive and courteous. The food is good. The bartender is on point."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"The service was horrible I asked for the manager to come out and apologized for the situation and he came back and apologized for the bad service. He then said he didn't take it personally but it was a little awkward. I will never be coming back to this location. Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this is by far the best. The salmon with the macaroni and cheese is one of the best I have ever had. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good and the lobster was seasoned well. My friend had the pork chop with rice and beans. The pork chop was very good. The beans were very good and the rice was good."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If you're looking for great sushi then this is your place! Definitely try the Supercrunchy roll and the Volcano roll. You won't find these on the paper sushi order form because these are special rolls. You have to
Write them in on the order form.  The ramen soup is definitely good but Charley is known for his sushi. Would recommend staying away from the Chicken Teriyaki as it was very dry. But other than that entree we've never been disappointed. 

We've been coming to Charley and eating his wonderful sushi for years. He originally had a place off of McMullen Booth, retired, and now has opened Charley's Sushi. So glad he's come back because I was missing my Super Crunchy Roll. We come here at least 1 time every 2 months. This place is a must if you're in the area. Always recommend Charley's to our family and friends."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The appetizers and oyster a were out of this world! 

The chargrilled oysters w garlic Parmesan sauce were the best thing there - we ordered a half dozen and then immediately ordered another dozen! And the crab appetizer with the crab claws was so, so good. Yelp check in discount for appetizers, and we got the $12 appetizer and it was discounted by $10. Great deal! 

We then got the trio sampler, shrimp and grits and crawfish ravioli as entrees, and honestly, while they were all decently tasty (though they were out of the étouffée), the oysters and crab really dwarfed the entrees. 

They were out of a lot because it was a busy weekend and we went on a Sunday night, so if there's something you're really wanting make sure they have it! 

Next time we are in New Orleans we'll be back for the oysters and appetizers!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Ross M., what are you talking about?  I'm not sure where your Chicago friends went for pizza when they were there, but I've tried hundreds of different pizzas in Chicago, so I consider myself quite the expert.  Needless to say, Paisano's will definitely not be on my list again. 

It was bad, but not horrible. Crust was decent, cheese was mediocre but the pepperoni was pretty good, hence the two stars instead of one. What killed this pizza was the sauce. Very, very bland, as if it just came out of a can. In my opinion, sauce is what ties everything together on a pizza and this was really disappointing. 

Also, the mozzarella sticks were warm, but the cheese was hard. That's kind of scary to me. I'm thinking of getting the leftover sticks carbon dated. The good reviews of bad Florida pizza continues to baffle me."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here without a reservation and they weren't pack so we were seated right now to my surprise (a party of 5). For appetizers, we order the meat board and snails. Both were really good. The meat board had what I assume fois gras. You'll definitely eat a lot of bread so pace yourself you don't want to be full and not eat your entree. For entree, I got the Bolognese, it was to expectation, nothing super fancy. However, friends got the duck and fish, which they enjoyed very much. Service was good. Be careful of the bathrooms, try to read the signs, two people at our table accidentally walked into the wrong one since they didn't know French. Ambience felt like a cafe, due to the tiles and wooden furniture. Overall, nice experience but I would like to try other foods next time to get a better experience."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place is great for my family because it is very close to the pool that we belong to. We started coming here around 5 years ago when one of our friends told us to meet them here. They have great food and it's all reasonably priced. We usually get Penne Vodka, a large plain pizza, fries, and salad. The Penne Vodka is creamy and the sun dried tomatoes really add a nice flavour. The fries are HUGE and they give you a nice amount. The pizza is delicious, and it tends to be on the brown and crispier side, but if you want a lighter cook you can request that and it tastes great either way! This restaurant is also AMAZING because they have the best French dressing that I have ever had and I LOVE my French dressing so this place is a 5 stars from me!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This is one of those places where you want to try something new and make a reservation but you can't get in the door until your table is ready. This place is pretty small, so it's not really a large dining experience. I would come here for the food alone but I would definitely come for the atmosphere and the service. They have a lot of TVs and a lot of games to watch. I ordered the beef jerky and the chicken kabob sandwich. Both were very good. I'm not a big fan of the hummus, but the kabob was very good. I would recommend coming here if you are looking for a quick lunch."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I went at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and there was a wait for a table. The waitress was not very attentive. There were four or five tables inside of the restaurant. The table next to us had a draft beer. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and a chicken biscuit. My wife got the chicken biscuit with a side of grits and my brother got the pork chop with gravy. Both meals came with two sides of grits and gravy. Both were very good. I had the grits, which were very good. My brother had the chicken biscuit with gravy. Both meals came with a side of grits and gravy."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"J C has good Caribbean food. The food is good but it's not really the best. The atmosphere is not very good. The food is not the best but the service is pretty good. They have good breakfast and lunch items. The food is ok but not great. The staff is always nice. I have never had anything bad here.I ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived 15 minutes after I placed it.  I asked the driver what it was and he said it was ""cold.""  I told him I had a delivery order and he said, ""well, that's what it's called.""  When I asked for it, he said, ""it's cold.""  I told him that I was ""just cold"""
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Worst dinner in New Orleans.  The food was just ok.  The waitress was rude and we had to ask her multiple times for water and then the manager never came to check on us.  We will not be back.I came here for the first time today. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the pork belly was very juicy and flavorful. My only complaint is that the sauce was too salty for my liking. I was a little disappointed by the bread. I really liked the bread but the sauce was not to my liking. I'll definitely go back to try the other dishes.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I was a chaat virgin and had the curry shrimp which was a nice spice kick. The portion was a little small but the food was delicious and the staff was friendly. The only downside was that it was hard to get a seat in the restaurant. I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant and was looking for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the Margarita and the Caprese tacos. I got the Caprese tacos with beef and the Margarita with shrimp. Both were delicious and were priced very reasonably. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Mexican restaurant. The food was delicious and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good Mexican food in the area.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I was really excited to try this place because I love Indian food! I was surprised by all the bad reviews but still went anyways. Everything was a little awkward.. more than half the section was closed off for banquet and the buffet section was small. The waiters were all very awkward. We didn't even know Naan was included until the owner? came over and told us. Then they brought the Naan and then brought another one but it was garlic naan. I don't get it.. and then they kept asking if we needed more naan when we had 2 baskets sitting there..and when we actually ran out, they never asked. Lol. But the food was very good and I'll def. go back. They were just awkward, not in a bad way! And there was lots of Indian families dining there so that means the food is fresh and good!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I came here with a big group of people for a celebration and it was an awesome experience! The atmosphere is perfect for upbeat conversations and laughter. We came for the last hour of happy hour and then stayed for another 2 hours after, ordering more drinks and talking! I would definitely recommend coming during Happy Hour since they have some awesome deals on food and drinks. For food, I ordered the loco nachos and the Street Trio tacos. Both were amazingly delicious (and on the Happy Hour menu-saved me around $6!) For the trio, I chose to get the Carne Asada, Gigante Chicken and Taco americano. All were really good but I liked the Giganted Chicken the best. Would highly recommend getting both of these dishes! 

Parking: there is a private lot to the right of Green Lemon that you can park at; if that's full, there's street parking."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We stopped in again for dinner on the way home from MD and were not disappointed. The place was packed and we had to eat at the bar (not my favorite place to eat dinner). As usual, their beer selection was extensive and the bartender knowledgeable - always a good combination. My wife had the Blue Cheese Burger with Sweet Potato Fries and I had a new item, the Pork BBQ Sandwich. Both choices were spot on and very tasty. Both my wife and I especially like d the cole slaw.

The ambiance is really nice and authentic - nothing fancy and the floors are uneven along with the tables. The bar has a ""lived in"" feel and it is obvious that this place caters to locals and I hope that it stays that way. Only a few minutes off of I-95, it is worth the detour for a great meal."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've been coming to the Alton area for years now, and I wish I visited this restaurant earlier. Our server was friendly and attentive, and a full bread basket was placed down as soon as she came over. We expected to wait a while because of the freshly fried chicken. But the wait was not bad at all even with a packed restaurant. The portion size and price are really unbeatable. The catfish was perfectly breaded and fried. Try it with the house hot sauce! The mashed potatoes, loaded baked potatoes, and fries were very well prepared. But the stars of the show were the fried chicken. Very well seasoned, battered, and fried. Plus, all the juice was locked in the chicken, so each bite made you wanting more. I blame their chicken for making me eat more than I planned to. I get why their chicken is famous now."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"the fish is the freshest you can buy on land.  i have bought red snapper here. i boiled some and broiled them and i was in culinary heaven.  the durados, from the meditteranean were fresh and meaty.  the fish case is fresh.  the fish come scaled and gutted, to reduce the smell.  please cook the fish whole and enjoy the tasty cheek morsels and other bits of the fish.  As a Greek person who loves seafood, I cannot say enough great things about this place.  The diver scallops were so plump and the taste after i fried them was amazing.  a little old bay and terragon and that is it.
cannot speak for dining in, but i enjoy cooking the food myself.

At $6 or $7 a pound for fish, a much better option than a big mac and fries or pizza and coke"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"The first time I had a real beef brisket sandwich.  The pulled pork sandwich was awesome.  The mac and cheese was a solid 4 stars.  The bun was very soft and moist.  The fries were good as well.  I would come back for the brisket sandwich and a burger.  I will most definitely be back.Delicious food and service!  We came here for a quick lunch and were happy to see that they have a good selection of beers on tap.  Our server was very attentive and friendly.  We had the crawfish etouffee and the shrimp and grits.  The etouffee was tasty, but the shrimp and grits were just okay.  I would go back for the shrimp"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food was delicious however, the service was slow. I saw a server walk around and just walk around doing nothing. The food was mediocre at best. The chicken was a little dry but it was okay. It was a little pricey for what it is. I've been coming here for about a year now and I've been disappointed by the service and quality of the food. I've had great experiences with the food and it's always good. It's very pricey for what it is, but it's the quality of food that keeps me coming back. I usually get the lamb shank with a side of rice and it's fantastic. The lamb is cooked just right and the rice is to die for."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Oh Handel's, you are my go to pizza place!  I will say that the dough is pretty good.  The crust is thin, but the sauce is very tasty.  I would definitely go again.  It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it.  I'd recommend this place to anyone.I had the crab cake with a side of pastries and my husband had the pork roast. The pork roast was great and the pastries were very tasty. We had a party of 10 and we all enjoyed the food and drinks. They have a very good selection of beers on tap. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. We would definitely come back here again.I'm a huge fan of this"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I was expecting more from this place, but the food was nothing special. The calamari and the gnocchi were the best things I have ever eaten. The only reason I gave this place a five star is because the service was extremely slow. My server was very nice and attentive. We did not order dessert, but it was a very large portion of dessert for $8.00. My husband had the pork chop with ham and it was good, but I would not have ordered it if I had known that the pork chop was going to be over-seasoned. My husband enjoyed his pasta and he thought the pasta was okay, but he would have liked to get the Italian sausage. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting St Pete"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Hands down THE BEST SUBSTANCE I've ever had!!!

And the best part? The BEST FOOD!!!

And the BEST SERVICE!!!

This place is so nice!I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken burrito and said it was pretty good. I had the pork taco which was good but nothing special. I will say the service was very good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd definitely go back for lunch again!I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. I liked the seasoning but the lobster was super salty and the mac and cheese was bland. The only reason I gave it four stars was because I was expecting the lobster mac and cheese to be better"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I came here on a Thursday morning for brunch around 10 AM and it's your typical average brunch spot. The menu is quite small and doesn't have many options- you can't customize much other.  They do not have avocado toast on the menu which is a huge disappointment. The young man taking our order was friendly and recommended to get toast and just pay extra for the avocado on top. 

My friend ordered a breakfast burrito. I took a bite and it was good, but just nothing out of this world for me. The one thing that stood out to me is the freshly squeezed orange juice. Oh, and apparently they are known for their hash. Not a budget friendly brunch spot either- we spent about $50, and I only got a piece of toast with some avocado on it, an orange juice and my friend ordered a breakfast burrito."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm in the odd camp that first tried Flying with Jerome for dinner, and wow it didn't disappoint!

To start, I couldn't pass up the french onion soup. The standout was its caramelized onions. And as all quality french onion soups do, it was covered in melty cheese. This one had swiss cheese, but I'm more of a fan of gruyere in french onion soup. Although, that might be kind of pricier, and it's still delicious with swiss cheese.

For my meal, I ordered the scallops. These were sooo good, they melted in my mouth. They were simple, atop a delicious risotto and adorned with lemon, white wine, and butter sauce. 

And as traditional with all European dinners (and maybe most places?) we ended with coffee. I loved the cappuccino here, because it has a super foamy cream on top. I'm excited to come back again for brunch and maybe even more dinner!"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Dave n busters best place ever!!!  Much better then that junky chunky chesse place. They have great games Fruit Ninja, doodle jump, connect four is gigatic, so is pacman, roller coaster simulator is always fun. There is something for everybody of all ages to do here. This place is huge and the food is good my kids love it and if they had it there way we'd go here every night.  We took the kids ( 9 and 15) here on new years eve and it was packed yet it still felt very safe to have my kids there that late at night. People were drinking but it was'nt like a drunken zombie event. It was a good place for my kids to feel a little grown up yet play and have a blast. Oh ya TICKETS My kids love to cash in there tickets and get cool stuff."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"These words are taken from my husband on his Facebook post about Big Lug:

""This is rare for me. so I apologize now if I leave out or put too much emphasis on one thing. I'm shouting out BIG LUG Cantina restaurant. It was so damn good I'm pissed off at them. How you gone just bring out killer crispy wings? HUH? Then you have the audacity to make them spiced and properly sauced. Whew!!! But when I asked for the best sammich. you just abused my taste buds with a ITALIAN beef and au jus that brought a tear to my SULTRY gorgeous brown eyes. ONLY to wash it down wiff an IPA that could make the sun set and the moon do back flips. Some times you have to take a stand. and tonight I am: BIG LUG CANTINA. You win. you made me post about you, your incredible food, and beyond belief service."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My group overall was unimpressed with Sopapilla's our first time here.  While 2/3 of my tacos were very good the rest of the table did not like their meals.
The mahi-mahi and cod tacos were also very good.

The crab and lobster enchiladas were extra disappointing. It was mostly crab and the crab tasted like it came from a can.

The second issue was the margarita, while the first was good the second one was too strong and came in a dirty glass with remnants of the last drink (i guess a strawberry margarita) at the bottom of the glass.

The atmosphere was very dark and nothing at all like New Mexico. The desert sopapillas were also good but not that hard to make to begin with. Not even close to the best sopapilla that I've ever had.  I hope I have a opportunity to come back and give them a second chance."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I am the true one here. The food is amazing. My husband and I have been here twice and we have had a great meal both times. The service is always great and the food is always great. It's a great place for a date night or to grab some drinks. I always get the same thing every time. I love the fact that they have a full bar. They have live music every night and it's pretty good. The food is always good and the service is always great. I always order the fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and the sweet potato fries. The Macaroni and cheese is the best I've ever had. It's on the thick side for my taste, but it's delicious."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Couldn't wait to come here again. The food was amazing. My husband had the BBQ shrimp and he loved it. The sides were delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only downside was that we had to wait in line a bit for our table. This is a great place for a quick lunch. We have been going to this place for over a decade. We have tried several different food items on the menu and each time we have enjoyed everything. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I love that they have a parking lot in front of the restaurant and a few parking spots at the back. They have a lot of options for people to sit and enjoy the food.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Food establishment set on the corner of the Reading Terminal and 11th Street, just off the Riverwalk.  Great drinks and food, and the staff is very friendly.  I had the seafood platter and it was good, but nothing special.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good.  I also had the crab cakes and they were tasty.  They were very good, but not spectacular.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was because the service was very slow.  The waitress was attentive, but the food was not that great.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,Great show! We had a group of 10 and we all loved it. The food was awesome and we will be back. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was fun. Would definitely recommend to anyone. The best in the area. The food is great and the service is great. Great people. Great place to go to watch a game or just hang out with a friend. I love this place! I came here for a quick lunch on a Saturday and it was very busy. The wait staff was very helpful and the food was absolutely delicious! They also have a great happy hour menu and a great wine list. I highly recommend this place!I love this place! Everything on the menu is delicious and the food is amazing.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I work at a nearby convenience store and the food is good.  However, the customer service is terrible.   The people behind the counter are the worst customer service I've ever experienced.  When I ask for a refill, they tell me it's ""the waiting list"" and then tell me they don't have it.   I never ask to speak to the manager.  When I ask about the food, they tell me they don't have it, so I can't have it.  I'm so disappointed.  I'm not going to go out of my way to eat here.  I just want some decent food and some good service.  I'll be going to this location to make sure my family can get better service"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Hands down, our favorite Lebanese restaurant in our drivable vicinity. Probably our favorite restaurant in Nee Orleans. My husband and I started frequenting this restaurant when we lived in the area 15 years ago, and we still make a trip here when we can. The food is on point every single time. The flavors are unbelievable.  The ingredients are quality and fresh. I tried the eggplant sandwich for the first time and it was ah-mazing! (No picture, when I saw it I immediately couldn't help myself and dug in.) The crisp and toasty French bread was the perfect vessel and added excellent, needed texture to the sandwich, which consisted of roasted eggplant, tomato, lettuce, and a couple kinds of cheeses. I have not had anything quite like it before and would get it time and time again. We always leave feeling extremely satisfied and look forward to going back next time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Love the food and great deals on happy hour but I will never go back to this location. Some friends and I went to for lunch, had terrible service but we each still tipped the lady. She was a young girl waiting the outside seats. The service was chaotic, we got our food in random orders (wrong dessert first, burgers then appetizers). We felt rushed as we were brought our checks while we were still eating. Anyways, as we were walking out, the waitress yells in front of all the other customers ""hey, you guys didn't pay!!!"" We turned around all awkward, showed our receipts and she said simply said ""oh.. ok"" and walked away. We were humiliated and felt profiled. This was our go to place for our friends to have lunch and drinks but we will never go back. If you're a person of color, id try going somewhere else."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"A cute little spot in Clearwater Beach. While Pearly's is not on the beach, you'd never know the difference. Theyve created a beachside restaurant atmosphere with the decor and menu offerings. This was my first stop in Clearwater Beach in large part because of the stellar reviews. 

I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and my fiance had the Shrimp baha bowl. I didn't like my Po Boy - the remoulade had what tasted like a mustard base which I was a little surprising and mostly overpowered the sandwich. I think the menu should make mention of the strong remoulade so customers can determine whether to order that or something else. I did get to try my fiance's bowl and was blown away - it was amazing. My tip for future customers would be to try the bowls, unless youre interested in the strong mustard based remoulade that the Shrimp Po Boy offers."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Came here for a late night meal. Im from nj so I always compare food from my state to others. I normally eat white rice and broccoli in brown sauce so thats what i ordered along with some chicken wings. Everything came up to 16$, which is pricey. In my hometown i get it for 4$. My food took about 7 min to cook. While i was waiting, many homeless people came in to beg, but the workers quickly told then to get out. When i got my food, i saw why it was 16$. I got a whole large container of broccoli which could feee 3 people easily. I wish it came with more rice because the rice to broccoli ratio was wayyy off. All in all, this is a good late night food spot that i was surprised i enjoyed. Not everyone makes broccoli in brown sauce that taste good."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My partner and I ordered a burger to share through DoorDash. They're rather new and are only doing delivery and takeout now. My food arrived hot and fresh. It was a great burger! Everything had plenty of flavor and it was a lot of food. It was 10$ for an excellent hearty burger with a hearty serving of garlic parm steak fries. They also offer tots, onion rings, slaw or Brussels sprouts as a side. They have a veggie burger I hope to try next and a lot of fun burger inventions. You can also find wings, mozz sticks, and loaded tots. My overall takeaway is that the people care about quality food. It may be a lot of your basics but high quality basics. The hand written note that came with our meal was so sweet and made me feel appreciated for being a customer and excited to return for more."
Restaurants,5.0,CG,"My brothers GF had heard about this place and we decided to try it out. I was pretty impressed. The food was delicious. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and great. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fry was on the cold side. The fries were also not crispy enough. The place was clean and nicely decorated. 

I would definitely come back here. I just wish there was more beer on tap. The prices are reasonable.This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese.  I loved it.  The only thing that could have been better was the mac and cheese was bland.  But I do love the food and the service.This is the best pizza place I've been too! Great food"

Restaurants,3.0,CG,For some reason the person who helped me with the menu was rude. When I asked for the check she said it would be $15.00 but the manager said $20.00. She said it would be $15.00. I told her I didn't want to have the money. She said no I didn't want to have the money. I explained to her that she didn't want to have the money. She said she didn't want to have the money. She said she wanted to be a part of the conversation. I asked for my bill she said it would be $30.00. I said ok ok it's only $30.00. She said ok I understand. Then we sat there and she went and said she didn
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I had a hot sausage and an eggplant sausage. I chose the eggplant sausage over the hot sausage. The eggplant sausage was delicious and crispy on the outside. The sausage was thick and flavorful. The hot sausage was a little on the dry side but still good. The eggplant sausage was a little tough to eat and it was a little too greasy for me. Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience. I would go back again!I'm very excited to have a new Chinese restaurant in Reno. The food was really good and the service was great. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all delicious. We will definitely be back. I had heard about this place for quite some time, but I never went."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I am officially obsessed with honeygrow! I have heard from so many people how good honeygrow is but I am still not sure why it took me so long to actually stop in. I decided for my first visit to make my own meal because I was curious as to what was all on the menu. I made a bowl that had rice noodles, chicken, green beans, and onion, with a sesame garlic sauce. I was so happy with my choice! It was delicious and extremely filling. The only downside is (and I did this to myself) was going exactly at lunchtime. The wait time was rather long, but I should have expected that since I was in the city at a prime time for lunch. Honeygrow made up for my wait and offered a coupon for my next visit which I wasn't expecting at all. I am already planning my next visit!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I guess many people come here for the ""experience"".  However, I came with a group of people and in doing my research on the place prior to my arrival, I decided that I could really care less about the ""experience"". My main concern was if the taste/quality of the food was going to justify its price tag. 

I ordered the Delmonico and of course it came with the soup, salad, baked potato, green beans, carrots, and onion strings. The steak was very tender and delicious (and just as delicious the next day) although I did add just a pinch more salt. The flavor of the green beans and the onion strings were off the charts! 

The Verdict: If coming for a special occasion, I wouldn't mind revisiting this place. Considering you're nearly getting a full course meal minus dessert I think that the steak prices are fair for a good quality steak."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The best best best part about this bar? The ambiance. I would say in the top 5 of restaurants in Philly. It has that whole feeling like you're outside in Miami (or I guess Cuba) but you're inside with the palm trees, the ceiling fans and the general atmosphere. I like to take people from out of town here for drinks and late night salsa dancing. 

I've been here several times throughout the 7 years I've lived in Philly and sure, sometimes it's been a hit or miss with the service. But when you get the food, it's 7.5/10 good. I also came here the other night for a fundraiser for the Philippines and the chef did spot-on great filipino food. I loved that 100% of the proceeds went to their organization of choice, the Red Cross. 

All around, a fun place to go late at night for a drink and salsa dancing."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My favorite late-night spot!!
Whether it's grabbing a few beers after the game or taking advantage of the half-price appetizers after 10:00 pm, this is one of my favorite places to go. If you want a steak that's as good as a fancy steakhouse without paying a fancy steakhouse price, this is the place to go. I also love the pizza (this is one of the few places where they actually serve it with my favorite topping-Canadian Bacon!) and the appetizers are out of this world. They even got me hooked on the zucchini sticks (try them!)! The service is always exceptional and the owner is usually there to make sure we as guests have everything we need. Although being there late usually means dealing with the rowdy patrons at the bar, we usually have no problems. Great place!! I can see myself being a regular here for a very long time to come."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. If I had one complaint, I guess it would be that when we go to either of the locations, we have a very long wait to get a table, but that is a testament to the food I suppose, so I can't complain. We usually just belly up to the bar and have a cocktail while we wait. 
  The Salads are wonderful and the pizza is the best around. I love it because I never ever feel icky when I am done eating it, like I do when I eat other pizza that has so much grease on it. The crust is awesome, I believe it's a corn meal crust or something, so it's not doughy. 
  Service is great. The servers are all really nice and helpful when ordering. I totally recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a healthier choice of pizza."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"My fiancé and I have been here a few times and we always love it. I have ordered the chicken and waffles and the wings. The chicken is seasoned just right and the wings are cooked just right. It's a little pricey for what it is but worth it. The staff is always friendly and the food is great. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal and a great time!This place is pretty good. I like that they have a ton of options to choose from. The menu has a variety of foods and drinks, and I usually end up with something I like. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. It's a fun place to sit and have a drink with friends."

I ordered the salmon, which was very good. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I did get a side of the panko bread which was good, but not the best I've ever had. The service was excellent. I would go back again for lunch, but I'm not sure I would order the same thing again.This is the best place to eat and have a good meal.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Arrived at the Mellow Mushroom location on the weekend and it was a nice surprise. I was pretty impressed with the food. The Chicken wings were good but the flavor was a bit off. The Mac and cheese was good. The potato salad was also good. I will be back. I'm always a fan of this place!  I love the atmosphere and the food is so good. I always get the gyro and the chicken gyro. Both are good and so are the sides. My only complaint is that the gyro is a little small, but I usually eat it with a fork. I usually do not have to worry about my gyro. The reason I like this place is because of the location."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We had a cocktail at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. The cocktails were strong and we loved them. 

We will definitely be back.I'm a fan of this place. I love the location. I've been there for lunch and dinner and it's always a great experience. I have to say it's a bit overpriced for what you get. I've had my share of the specials and the meals are always very good. It's very busy on weekends and I've never had a wait. The staff is very friendly and the food is always good. I've had the pork and chicken wings and they're both fantastic. I love the chicken and the sauce is delicious. The only thing that I've had that I've not liked"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Couple of points to ignore about this place and I promise you, this will be the most amazing food your ever had. 

1) don't except perfect ambience 
2) no alcohol but it's BYOB
3) not proper sitting 

The staff is amazing and such a positive people. They will guide you through the menu and perfectly understand what you need. We ordered red falafel sandwich and my husband ordered platter with hummus and falafel. Both the plates had enough quantity and the quality of food is amazing. 

We have been to Zahav and I can promise you that food is equally comparable on terms of quality to this place. 

Give it a chance and I promise you won't be disappointed. We also ordered Turkish coffee and baklavah at end. We almost paid 28 dollars for two people. They also accept cards. Staff is lovely please treat them with respect. Authentic Mediterranean menu not the American version."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went to the the overly touristy (but oddly cute) Johns Pass and found this spot with very high ratings on Yelp!. We were blown away. The menu changes daily based on the catch. The food is so fresh and so delicious that I was doubtful we could ever leave. Seated outside in the Hurricane Hole with two little girls we found our bliss. Dolphins swam by with pelicans and blue herons in the sky. Sailboats and fishermen waving from their vessels. Generous wine pourings. Thoughtful and quite lovely staff. We would've stayed all afternoon if we hadn't promised a beach stop. Don't pay any heed to the 'no kids' rating if your kids eat off of a fantastic menu vs. expecting mac-n-cheese/nuggets/fries and that other gross-dom. Our kids yummed up the conch chowder, fish spread, gulf shrimp, blackened grouper, beach slaw and rice w/peas just like we did. I can't wait to go back!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is my first post on Yelp but I am so tired of the experience.  My husband and I have been coming to the Prime Rib for over 5  years every time we visit our son who lives in Rittenhouse Square.  The beef offerings have always been consistently good and better than the big beef chain restaurants in Philadelphia. The bar design is fabulous with good mood music.  Our  ""beef"" is with Joe the bartender.  We really want to love this place but unless one is a regular expect to be ignored and treated like a bumpkin.  On our recent visit, he totally ignored 2 patrons as he tended to his regulars with service and chat.  His affected mannerism needs to be taken down a few notches and could do with a course in how to treat everyone.  I realize this post will offend some."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Let's start with the good...the ambiance is lovely, parking is easy, it's close to the freeway and other shopping.  Our server was kind.  I love that the menu on the website and in person shows very clearly which items are gluten free, and there are lots of options.  We were there on a Sunday and they have a pork chop special on Sunday, the pork chops were beyond delicious!  Everyone enjoyed their salads. 
The not good...it's a steakhouse and the 2 people in our party who ordered steaks were extremely disappointed.  The presentation was seriously lacking, and the meat was almost flavorless and dry.  Even the baked potato was not up to par.  The prices are some of the highest I have ever seen in this area, so there was reason to expect a good steak.  If we ever return, we will order the pork chops."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I went to Pagano's tonight and ordered 4 cheese steaks for my family. I'd been hearing a lot about this place lately and decided to check it out tonight. The steaks were chocked full of meat and the rolls were fresh and soft. Aside from that, they were nothing to write home about to momma. One reviewer said she preferred cheese steaks from The Explorer's Den. I don't know if they're still in business, but I stopped going to TED years ago. They had several fat ladies making the cheese steaks. It was very hot outside and inside as well. Their fat bat wings were swinging back and forth as they cooked the steaks and sweat was just dripping down onto the steak. It totally grossed me out and I left after seeing that and never returned. Hey, I wanted a cheese steak with extra cheese and fried onions, but not someone's body secretions!"

Restaurants,3.0,CG,"This place is just OK. Not a whole lot of food but it's decent for the price. The atmosphere is nice. The staff is friendly and the drinks are tasty. The only thing that I would like to change is the size of the plates. This place is a joke. You would think a fast food place would be able to make a big meal with cheap food. Not the case. I went there with my family for my birthday. The food was decent, but not worth the wait. I would go back, but I would probably stick to the cheesesteak.The food is great, but the service is just awful. We went on a Sunday evening, and there was only one other table at the time.

I've had my fair share of good food from here and they have always been a good experience. The service is always friendly and helpful. The menu has a variety of options for you to choose from. There is a lunch and dinner menu as well as lunch and dinner menus. I love the chicken and steak tacos and the shrimp and grits. I've had the shrimp and grits
Restaurants,3.5,CG,On one of the first time I had the shrimp fried rice. It was amazing!  The other two times I've had the eggplant parmigiana. Both were great. I'll definitely be back. I came here for lunch with my family. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the pork belly was very juicy and flavorful. My family also had the gyro plate. They were very generous with the portion size and the meat was perfectly cooked. The rice was soft and the meat was tender. We had the seitan wings and the fish tacos. I would definitely come here again.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We had our rehearsal dinner here for about 50 guests and it was amazing! Joey was incredibly helpful and flexible, let us come in to decorate, and personalize the evening to make it our own. The food was great!!! Everyone couldn't get enough of the toasted raviolis and chicken wings. The pizza was also a big hit, everyone left feeling satisfied. The service staff was friendly and attentive. The restaurant had sound equipment available for toasts and a friend of ours who played the guitar. They also had karaoke available for our guests which made the night unique with a casual and fun vibe. My family said we didn't have a rehearsal ""dinner"" we had a rehearsal ""party"". Everyone had a great time. I would highly recommend this for private events as it has wonderful staff, space, food, and fun!!! Plus, it was very reasonably priced for the services we received."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"It was the best Margarita I have ever had but as far as the food goes it was not worth the $33. I like beef and it took along time to come around the 2nd time to get a bigger bite than the 1st one. The chicken and grilled veggies only came around once in 45 min. There was nothing special about the salad bar at all. The staff was very nice but if you want another napkin it seems to be a real issue. I asked 3 time for another napkin because I got BBQ sauce all over mine and it was getting on my clothes.  
 The 3rd time I asked a manager. I watched as he told a wait staff and they ripped the napkin off of the table and said something snotty about it. Then he brought it to me. Thank You but no thank you. I wouldn't go back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I have been to the original Ybor location many times. The building is amazing, and the ambiance is great. The flamenco show was great too, and the food is really good. However, the staff at this location is extremely pretentious and rude. All customers should be treated well, regardless, but my party always eats large meals and drinks plenty of alcohol. Maybe the image they want at this location is to be rude?!  It is really sad. I also called for catering and was purposely hung up on by the bartender and manger. They said catering and hung up the phone. I was not surprised. I called the Clearwater location and was immediately treated with respect by the manger.  I have also gone to the Columbia Cafe at the History Center on the river many times by car and by boat with no complaints. I will not be returning to the Ybor location."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is way worth the wait! It was jam packed every time I tried to get a seat, so just know you'll have to wait to get in.

I sat at the bar and had a friendly bartender. Several great cocktails and draft beers. I ordered the wood fired oysters and the catfish and man oh man, so on point! The oysters tasted like a mixture of butter and sambal, and were the tastiest oysters I had in all of New Orleans. A hint of lemon on top balanced out the flavors. Highly suggest ordered some bread to dip into the sauce!

Next the lightly pan-fried catfish on a bed of rice was incredibly flavorful. Mint, lemon, and a plethora of other herbs and flavors made this incredibly aromatic dish. The flavors caught me off guard from the typical Cajun seasoning, but it was delicious.

If you're more into sandwiches, check out their sister restaurant next door!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"When I think of Perkins it reminds me of Denny's.  A big chain with average food.  I've been to this one a time or two for breakfast.  Recently they have gone crazy with multiple menus.  Everyone at the table was handed three.  That's ridiculous!  

As for the food they get points for variety.  There is something to satisfy almost everyone.  Unfortunately everything is just average (at best).  As mentioned by another reviewer, go to almost any diner and you'll get a better meal.  In this case it will take you about three minutes to drive to the Llanerch Diner for a great experience.  

The servers here have usually been friendly but that doesn't make up for the inadequate food.  One other note; stay away on late Sunday mornings.  The folks getting out of the local churches descend on this place like locusts!"

We have tried several different food items on the menu and each time we have enjoyed everything.  The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always friendly and quick.  I love that they have a parking lot in front of the restaurant and a few parking spots at the back of the restaurant.  It is a wonderful location and we have been to a few other restaurants in the area and have been very satisfied

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love this place when I'm not watching my calorie intake. 

It really is a luncheonette, with counter seating and booths, a few tables. Not well decorated- the sad clown painting freaks me out. However, the breakfast is awesome. Check out the specials board (which never seems to change much) for some cool omelets and waffles- I recommend kielbasa and cheese, OJ and a copy of the Trentonian.

Best part- Price. The place is very appropriately priced for the menu items, which include all the standards but nothing more complicated than a patty melt. Service is very friendly and lightning fast. Food is good- not amazing, but good. It's a great place to take kids. I love that I can see most of the kitchen from my booth.

Worst part- the coffee is pretty weak, but what do you expect at a diner. They do not take credit cards, but there is an atm just down the block."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Packed on a Saturday night. Still had to wait even though we had reservations. No room to stand while waiting. Food came out somewhat slowly. Better take your antacids before coming here. These dishes pack heat! The szechuan type of spicy is one that has the power to enhance Asian dishes rather than mask the flavors of the individual meats and vegetables. 

- Wontons in chili oil: Wonton skins were on the soggy side. Too much oil.
- Chicken dry pepper style: Nicely fried texture on the chicken. Tender on the interior. The chili peppers add crunch and partner well with the chicken. 
- Shrimp hot sauce style: Actually thought this was spicier than the dry pepper style. The shrimp were juicy and a decent size. Enjoyed the combination of cabbage and celery as well. Expected the sauce to be much thicker though. 

A plus that it's BYOB. The old city location is still my favorite =)"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Delicious. Absolutely delicious. My girlfriend and I have been looking for good sushi and we have finally found it!

We ordered the edamame and snow crab salad as our appetizers. They came out quickly and were delicious!

My girlfriend ordered the snow crab Naruto and the Turner Maki. The snow crab Naruto was filled with plenty snow crab and was wrapped tightly! Best Naruto she's ever had! The Turner Maki was a little strange has there is a beef strip over the sushi that surprisingly went well together. I ordered the soft shell crab with rare beef teriyaki. The beef was cooked to perfection! The soft shell crab roll was also delicious! Both of my dishes had plenty of flavour! The only downside was the amount of teriyaki sauce on the steak. It was very over powering, but I'll get it on the side next time. The service was spectacular and the restaurant has a nice and vibrant staff."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"As a recent pescatarian, I have been trying to find restaurants around me that would allow me to not give up the taste of meat while still being able to stick to my choice of diet.

After a few yelp searchers I came across HipCityVeg. It seemed to be really popular since there are various locations in Philly. 

I ordered the crispy hipcity ranch and the vanilla milkshake. I was suprised at how close the sandwich resembled the taste of a real chicken sandwich and actually even better than most chicken sandwiches I have tasted. The milkshake tasted like any milkshake if you replaced cow milk with soy milk.

One thing that I enjoyed the most about my meal was that I felt satisfied without the overstuffed gross feeling you get after you eat a large meal.

I do think this place is overpriced like many vegetarian/vegan restaurants, but it is always nice to treat yourself once in awhile."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I was in town on business and was looking for some good pizza. I always read Yelp for local reviews. Some of the yelper reviews seemed pretty good, so I decided to try this place out. I ordered a large pizza mushroom/pepperoni, 5 wings, and an antipasto salad. The wings were huge a good size and tasty, the salad was fresh, the pizza was ok, not as good as I anticipated. I have been to some amazing pizza places, so I'm a pretty tough judge when it comes to pizza, honestly if I had to grade it on a 1-10 scale, I'd give the pizza a 5 1/2 maybe 6. It's definitely better then your average franchise pizza. It's no NYC pizza, but then again, my hopes weren't that high. All in all, the atmosphere was inviting, service was quick, food was average. If I were in the area again, I might try another menu item."

The creole rice with the shrimp and shrimp in it was a bit too salty for me. I ordered the chorizo tacos, and they were the most disappointing tacos I've ever had. I've had better. I just didn't care for the horchata. It was just a tad salty for me, and I couldn't taste the mushrooms. The black beans, which were supposed to be just beans, were super dry and tasted like they were sitting on a plate in a microwave. It was disappointing, but I'd go back to try the other dishes."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Pros:
- Super convenient to both the french quarter (for all those must visit places on your travel list), AND also the CBD (central business district; for all your modern day food & drank needs).
- upgraded elevator system that allows you to put in your desired floor number, after which the system directs you to a specific elevator 
- super friendly staff; everyone was always on their best southern behavior with their smiles and greetings. Help was easily accessible if needed.

Cons:
- they are currently in the process of upgrading the rooms, and it's easy to see why - some of the carpeting is really old, as are the tiles in the bathroom, the furniture and the tv's. They are not *bad* per say, just not as new and shiny as some of the other places I've been to.

Tips:
- get a room on a high floor! your views of the city will be spectacular, and it's beautiful at night."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"One of my favorite places to get quality sushi! First what sets this place apart is their rewards program where you earn points towards gift cards for a free meal and you get a $10.00 gift certificate for christmas and your birthday! Also, the quality is amazingly fresh! The kani salad is nicely prepared and the rolls are artfully prepared and so yummy! The all you can eat deal is sun-thurs for $22.00 a person and it is a super great deal as it includes all you can eat appetizers, sushi and dessert. It has a nice atmosphere inside and the staff is very attentive. Only downside is they get busy once and a while so you may have to wait for your sushi a bit but it is byob and they have a tv in there so the wait is bearable if they are busy and worth it in the end for such yummy fresh food!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went here on a Wednesday night with my bestfriend with no wait, tables were available. The entrance is like no other restaurant that I've been to - it's underground! The interior is a dark, relaxed atmosphere and is much larger with more seating compared to the the Ichicoro location in Tampa. 
For drinks, we both had the Ruby Weapon, comprised of tequila and watermelon - yummy, refreshing and not too sweet. Bestfriend had the Chicken Paitan Ramen and I had to the Spicy Abora Soba Ramen (brothless). The Chicken Paitan was rich in flavor and the Abora Soba had a perfect level of spicy/flavor, not super spicy but you can taste the slight burn. However, the grilled pork tasted too dry for my liking. 
Prices are average for the area. Our total came out to be $59 with tip included. We were not that hungry for appetizer or dessert, but I will definitely try some next time!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Wow.  Wow wow wow.  We were visiting the area and decided to take a chance on the Smokehouse.  I am a very picky person, especially when it comes to corned beef - which I love - but so rarely order out because of how fatty it can be.  After an assurance by our server, Cheri (spelling?) I ordered the corned beef platter and my husband had the sandwich.  Never in our lives have we seen corned beef this lean and delicious.  It melted in your mouth and there wasn't one bit of fat on it.  A surprising side was smoked gorgonzola mac 'n cheese with corn salsa - what a great idea and how yummy!!  Our server was attentive and friendly and we had a great time.  We want to move to Dunedin just so we can eat here!  :)    Absolutely great, thank you!!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This restaurant is like Philippino cuisine with upscale dining. This restaurant located at clubhouse of the tennis club. It is surrounded by 17 tennis court. Mainly serving the people who play tennis here. It is kind of tuck away from main street. 

The restaurant is well set up. Restaurant name is Match Point Grilled. It also call Karma coffee. I was confused at first when I walk into the restaurant. We ordered Kare Kare. This dish serve with traditional oxtail. It come with rice. The quantity of oxtail is less and not matching the price listed. The other dish we have is the Beef Afritada. It is tomato base stew. This dish give a little more beef. It is come with rice.

The salad was so fresh and had great flavor. The mussels were also very tender and cooked to perfection. The chicken was a bit dry but I think it was just the chicken and rice. The salad was also very good. The chicken was very tender and it was on point. The salad itself was very fresh and it was very tasty. The salad itself was very fresh and very flavorful. The only thing that could have been better was the bread. The bread was soft and the chicken was not toasted. The only thing that would have made a difference was if the bread was more generous."

Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Worst Quizno's I've ever had. Quizno's is generally mediocre at best, but wow...

First off, the order was screwed up.

Second, there are multiple health code violations visible from the customer side of the counter. Board of health should be ashamed of itself for permitting this place to stay in business. Unless a passing grade is so low that they're within compliance which is the state's fault.

Third, the sandwich literally fell apart on first attempt to pick it up. 

Fourth, sandwiches are only available in 8"" lengths. They don't slice an 8"" in half. If it held together, that would be acceptable, but it doesn't so fuck it.

Fifth, the employee exuded apathy and what seemed to be the manager gave some semblance of a crap, so that earned them 2 stars.

I'll be sure to avoid thus dump on my next shuffle through this airport. Terminal C of the Nashville airport is to good food what cancer is to good cells."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"FAB-U-LOUS food at this cute little sports bar 
caz-ual in Clifton Heights. The staff is as friendly as can be, just as they are at their sibling, The Clam Tavern, next door. I've never reviewed The Clam, b/c frankly, they're sooo good they don't really need my little review. But i JUST found out that The Broadway, which is often less crowded, serves BOTH menus. So HOW can you go wrong? Answer: You CAN'T. If you're on a 1st date, or a special one, you might want to go to The Clam (NOT that it's fancy, it's NOT), as it's a little more formal. But if you're up for a casual night, The Broadway Bar & Grill is PERFECT! And you MUST try the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, it's positively To Die For! The wedge salad w/Russian dressing & crispy bacon & the chili are WINNERS, too. I don't think you can go wrong here. Great menu, great food."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Have now visited this establishment 3x over the past 2 months, and I must say I am incredibly impressed and why this is now one of my favorite restaurants. First is the exceptional food.  My personal favorite is the turkey leg, but others in my group have loved the fried chicken, ribs, turkey meatloaf special, and bologna.  Sides are all solid - cauliflower, Mac & cheese are two favs. Second is the passionate and friendly people who work there and want you to enjoy your meal. Owner / chef Rick gets a ton of credit for creating the right culture!  Third is the setting.  Warm and friendly with plenty of seating. Fourth is the prices which are reasonable.  Fifth is the fact they are constantly experimenting. Whether it be a few new dishes in 2018, to adding a catering menu.

This is a must visit place for those who live in or visit stl."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Mony's is a hole in the wall type of spot. Small interior; walls are lined with tables that seat two, and the line takes up the center aisle of the shop. There are a few tables outside Mony's to sit at, or simply be a stoop kid and chow down on the steps leading inside. 

Seems like this is a pretty popular spot for locals in SB. There was a line of about 10 people in front of my party when we arrived at lunch time. Although seating was limited, the quality of the tacos I ordered were fantastic. The soft flour tortillas used for my tacos were steaming fresh, the chicken and steak was perfectly cooked, and the salsa mixture doused on the tacos was delicious! In addition, my friend ordered a burrito that turned out to be HUGE! The burritos can easily feed two hungry adults!!! 

Bottom Line: Solid casual hole in the wall Mexican food."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"On my previous trip to Tampa, I was very disappointed.

The ambiance was pretty cool. There was a cute spot, but the food was not great. The creole rice with the shrimp and shrimp in it was a bit salty. I was expecting some sort of sauce with the shrimp. The shrimp was the most flavorless part. The rice was tasteless and the shrimp was just watery. I would not go back.

The prices are very high for what you get. I ordered a salad, but I felt like they charged me $11 for it. The salad was really good. I really liked the dressing on the side. The shrimp and shrimp was cooked perfectly. The rice was a bit on the salty side, but the shrimp and shrimp were good."
Restaurants,5.0,CG,"Have seen their great reviews, but I thought it was pretty good.

The food is really good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries are ok. The fries are not that great. They were cold and mushy. I would give them 3 stars if I could.

The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they didn't have a good selection of beers on tap. I would go back for sure.I've been here several times, and I usually have a great time. They have good food, but it's kind of loud. It's not a bad place for drinks and to watch the game. It's a nice spot to hang out with a few"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I'm not one for hyperbole, but I thought the fried chicken was pretty good. I was pretty disappointed that it was the only thing that was good, the flavor was pretty average, and the chicken was a little bland. 

I also ordered the gyro meatballs which were also pretty good. I liked the meatballs, but the sauce was a little too strong for me. I just didn't care for the gyro meatballs, because it was pretty much dry. Overall, I'd probably go back, but I would probably stick with the gyro meatballs.I'm from California and have eaten at many different Mexican restaurants in the area. I've had the steak tacos and chicken tacos and both were good. I went here for the first time and I had"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My first stop in Nashville, I had the combo burger. It was delicious, the fries were crispy and so flavorful. The house salad was also delicious, and the greens were very fresh. I was pleasantly surprised by the service, which was also very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely return and recommend to anyone looking for a tasty, healthy option to enjoy a quick bite to eat.We love this place. The food is always great and the service is excellent. I love the service from the waitress to the bartender. The decor is very fun, very colorful. The place is clean and welcoming. The food is always good. The place is not too big, which makes it a little difficult to sit and enjoy the food. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. I would recommend it for"

The food was delicious. The cocktails were excellent. The staff was very attentive. My boyfriend and I ordered the churros and they were excellent. I had the pork belly fajitas which was so good.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Wow!! What a fantastic restaurant. I came here when I was visiting my parents in Berwyn and was so excited to see they have a location back home in Denver I will have to check out sometime. I came here with my parents and husband and we all had delightful meals.  The menu is varied and has both vegan and vegetarian options as well as meat dishes. There are also gluten free options so there's something for everyone. I had the matcha horchata which I am now obsessed with and cannot recommend enough. Smooth and delicious and lightly sweet. I ordered the vegan unbeetable burger for my meal and it was delicious and filling. I really just had the best time here and will definitely be back. 

The atmosphere is open and light though it made for a slightly noisy room! It was a little chilly.  It was busy but we got seated quickly without a reservation."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This review is only for their food. I didn't really want to go here at first due to the mediocre reviews. But after their $5 dollar burger deal came out, I thought it'd be worth a try. The burgers were average--your run of the mill bar burger, but the fries and tots were too greasy for my liking. Now, the reason why I came back was for the chicken nachos. That dish has been consistent in taste and presentation. It's always the same extremely shareable size and delicious. My reason for the three star review is because other than the chicken nachos, the burgers and main entrees we've tried have been inconsistent. The burgers are sometimes cooked well and sometimes too dry. The fries are sometimes perfect and sometimes too greasy. The main entrees are sometimes fresh tasting and sometimes not. Due to this 50/50 food experience, I am hesitant to give it a 4 or 5 star review."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Yum yum yummy!! Ok, in the last few weeks I have returned here 4 times since I am NOW finally a Sushi lover. Now I am buy far an expert, I am still experiencing with all the different rolls!! 

I love coming here because everyone is so friendly and helpful in helping me make the perfect choices.  Lily our waitress was so helpful and even turned me onto Mickey Mouse !! First time ever having raw tuna !! I loved it. 

Everything here is so fresh, no fishy smells or tastes. For 17.95 all ya can eat !! Can't go wrong !! And the rolls aren't huge huge ! So you can try a few different ones. My favorite is the King Kong, it's cooked and a little bit fried. Also the upside down shrimp is excellent !! 

So, I would highly recommend stopping in !! Tell Lily I said hellllllo and I will see her soon !"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came in here with 3 coworkers. Started with an Arnold Palmer to drink and a full order of Redneck nachos (AKA, crinkle cut fries) with pulled pork and cheese.  Food starter to share for 4.
We all ordered off the Sammich Menu.  The other 2 guys got the Big Ole Bubba which was a massive pulled pork sandwich on toasted buttered Texas toast.  I ordered the brisket meltdown which was a huge brisket sandwich with onion rings on the sandwich on Texas toast.  I got a side which was 2 jalapeño poppers wrapped in bacon.  Yummy.  

This place came highly recommend by the guys that are local and they hit the nail on the head.
This meal was a knockout!!  

I hope to come back down from CLT in the future and have a repeat visit to this great eating establishment!!  5 stars and I'd give it 6 if t was an option!!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My first trip to Johnny's was better than my recent visit.  My husband and I both had the shrimp and oyster PoBoy.  It was strange because the only way I could get that combo was to order a half shrimp and half oyster so I was charged for 4 1/2 sandwiches, however, the priced ended up being about the same if I would have ordered 2 whole sandwiches, I just had to rearrange them so each had some shrimp and some oysters.

Anyhow, the shrimp were very hard (way overcooked) but the oysters were good and of course the french bread was out of this world.  Could have used a little more mayo in the dressing and the fact that they charge you if you want your sandwich dressed is a little strange.  

Will have to try a few other PoBoy restaurants next time I'm in NOLA.  Johnny's isn't bad but it's not great either."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,PERFECT BYOB sushi spot! Wish I had more time to try the sushi.Had a reservation for 4.50pm on Sunday. Ordered a small sushi bowl and a half of it was barely cooked. When I called to complain I was told it was going to be a problem. The manager said it's not a problem and it will be fixed soon. I called again and was told it was just a problem with the kitchen. I asked if they could replace the bowl and they said they could. I explained that I'd like to order from the menu and it would be just a few minutes. The manager said they would have to wait a while for the bowl. I told him I'd like to check and they said they would. When he said he'd take care of
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food is great, reasonably priced, and the service is good. 

The only thing I would change is the dessert. The ice cream is the best part. The dessert is so worth it. 

The only reason this is not 5 stars is because the service was horrible. They were completely incompetent. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my food to be brought out and my drinks were empty. I was there for two hours waiting for a table and not even half the tables were full. The servers were incredibly rude and the manager was clearly annoyed with the wait. 

The only reason this is not 5 stars is because of the service. We had a very nice waitress and she was a sweetheart. She was very nice but she was also very slow."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Just had my husbands birthday here last night and we decided to split a bottle of the wine and we were so impressed. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that we didn't like was the outside seating which was a little uncomfortable and uncomfortable for the two of us. The food was also really good and we will definitely be back!Great food, great service. I had the salmon with pork belly and it was delicious. I will definitely be back for sure. 

The only downside is the location, but the service and food were great!I'm a huge fan of the sushi, and this place is probably the best in Tucson. I've only had the salmon and the fish, but I've had the sushi and the sushi and both were very good."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I will start by saying that the service was very good.  We had a reservation and the staff was very attentive.  We sat at the bar, we got a great conversation and were able to order drinks quickly.  We ordered the crab cake appetizer and it was very good.  The crab cake was a bit too sweet for me but the flavor was excellent.  I will say that the crab cake was a little dry for my liking but it was good.  The sauce was very good too.  The fried shrimp was really good too.  I had the shrimp tempura with spring roll and it was really good.  The mushroom soup was also really good.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sushi.They have the best breakfast I've had in a while"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Oh, holy chicken fingers. Yes, you heard me. Chicken fingers. Hold this in your memory because I probably won't be raving about chicken fingers for another 5 years. I swear I'm not a snob but this isn't typically a dish I'd run to on the menu- especially at a burger joint. (Note, surprisingly enough, Bru also makes some of the best salads in town).

What made the chicken fingers so delicious? The fine balance between crispy corneal based exterior meets juicy and tender interior. All paired with homemade ketchup and honey mustard. I now have a new go-to at Bru. Paired with a salad and you have a meal. 

As for the Carmel location, it is quite spacious and located a stone's throw from the Carmel arts district. Parking is easy in the lot adjacent to the restaurant. Most importantly, the customer service was incredible. The manager stopped by to check on us and our server was both attentive and friendly."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went here with some friends for restaurant week.  it was $35 per person and it is not a specific menu for restaurant week.  It was a four course meal (appetizer, preset pasta, entree, and dessert) - great deal, but the preset tomato sauce penne pasta dish was a bit unnecessary (just seemed like a filler).

-For appetizers, the crab cake was huge and filling, but quality was not the best.  However, the grilled and fried calamari were quite delicious.  
-For entrees, the New York strip was a larger portion, but the steak itself was on the drier side...however the mushroom sauce that they pair along with the steak compensates for the steaks dryness and the sauce itself was very savory and flavorful. 
-For desserts, the tiramisu wasn't the best; it was little too cakey for me.  The creme brulee was filling and super thick and I would say it's one of the better dessert options there."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I often have boys who chases after me that ask themselves, ""What's the key to her heart?"" Let me tell you this, it's simple. The answer is chicken. I know good chicken when I see it. After being a frequent customer at good ol' Chick Fil A, I decided to check out Cane's on its opening day. Oh boy was I not disappointed. The nice crispy breading that engulfs the warm tender chicken inside is like sex in my mouth. Add their coleslaw with that, chicken will be the only thing I need in my life. The staff isn't as great as the chicken I can tell you that. They often mess up my order whenever I order to go, like not giving me fries or not giving me my drink. It's not really a big deal. The staffs always apologizes for messing up my order and give me whatever is missing and we both go along with our days."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Upscale pho.  What?  Hello oxymoron?

Parking is available in the lot out front.

The interior is, well, upscale.  Not the dirty-looking beaten up insides you find inside big chains such as Pho Hoa.  I was pleasantly surprised.  There is an article from a newspaper hanging on the wall.  Apparently others have noticed as well.

Interestingly, the typical pho here is split into 3 types: Northern, Central (Hue), and Southern.  I had the Northern pho.  The food was served in an upscale-looking bowl.  The sauces were filled in small dishes, instead of the large squeeze bottles like most other places.  At $11, it was a bit pricey, but the presentation here is awesome.  The noodles were nice and springy, and the meatballs were homemade.  They are unusual for sure.

Honestly I never thought I would ever find good Asian food in Edmonton, but my impressions have changed for the better now.  Recommended."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,The food is not good. We had the crab cakes which were cold. The cheese steak was horrible. The burger was very good. The fries were also awful.

Great food and great service. They have a great menu with lots of different items to choose from. I always get the shrimp tacos and it is amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the wings but it's great! Their red beans and rice are also really good. They also have a nice beer selection. It's a fun place to sit and have a drink. I've been here a few times and I've had a great time

I would recommend coming here on a weeknight if you are staying at the Hyatt.I used to love this place. I always get the shrimp dumplings. I get my food the same way every time I go.

The service was excellent, we had a great time and enjoyed the food. The only thing that I would change is the size of the tables. The servers seemed to be a little more aware of us and the food was very good. I will definitely be back for a great meal!This place is pretty good. I like that they have a ton of options to choose from. The menu has a variety of foods and drinks, and is usually very reasonably priced. They have a great selection of beers on tap. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. They have a small patio for those of us who are not in a hurry."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I have been to Jake's a number of times and really like their burgers.  I do like a greasy burger which these are so if you that turns you off you may not like them as much as I do.  I would say they are similar to Five Guys and Elevation Burger which I'd also give 4 stars each.

I've only had a non-burger (chicken sandwich) once and thought it was just average so I've stuck with their burgers since then.  I think overall it's a bit on the pricey side.  Depending on what burger I get it usually runs me $9-$12 for the meal (burger+fries+medium soda).

This location has a TV which is good since it usually takes 5-10 minutes before getting your food.  This is not a complaint.  I'm not expecting it to take less time since they're not just grabbing a burger that was made half an hour earlier sitting under a heat lamp."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place is popping. We came here towards the end as they were closing (which we felt super bad about, but we were already in the Uber on the way). Everyone, except the hostess was nice and accommodating. I don't know why she out of everyone was upset for because when 2pm hit, she was running out the door, while our server took an amazing care of us. One of our friend's throat wasn't feeling good, and our server brought her a cup of hot water, lemons, and HONEY happily. I wish I got her name, because she is excellent. 

I got the Chicken St. Chartes and it was DELICIOUS. I want to go back just to eat it again. The French toast baton was also amazing. I think one of the best French toast I've ever had. It was sooooo good by itself and even better when dipped into syrup. 

All in all. Everything was amazing, except for the hostess."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Oh, so very bad. My experience today: Shame on me, I guess, for not asking if they had a vacuum.  I paid for the ""upgraded"" wash.   Go thru the wash, pull to the left, a couple of folks dry off my car.  No one touched the inside.  Where is the vacuum?  They tell me they don't have one, but I can drive over to the OTHER place, a couple of miles away.    Really?  So, I did, they tell me I'd have to wait in line AGAIN, for a vacuum, and they'd have to charge me, then redact it from my credit card.   I spoke to the manager, who didnt stop chewing his meal, to tell me ""that's just the process"".    Im still mad and that was hours ago.  So bad.   Pro Customer Service tip to the owners:  Buy them a damn handheld!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"After reading several reviews my wife and I dined here on July 13th, 2014. One of the deciding factors was that the owner Luigi is from NY. I myself grew up in the NYC area, and with that said I know something about good Italian food. I can attest that the food here is deliciously good, in fact even better than most Italian restaurants I have dined at in NYC. Anyone from NY can tell you that finding good Italian food in Florida is definitely a challenge. Do yourself a favor and dine here, I guarantee you will absolutely LOVE this place !  

I personally talked with Luigi (the owner), a nice guy and a true gentleman. Turns out Luigi is from my hometown of Mount Vernon, NY. Thank you Luigi for a terrific dinner, you and your wait staff were great. My wife and I can't wait to return for another great dinner."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Seriously, I am dumbfounded by this. The food is just ok. The service is terrible. If you go to the West Philly location, you should get the Treme. The food is mediocre at best. It's not even worth a shot. If you come to Philly, you should visit the West Philly location.The food is decent, but the service is terrible. We had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork tenderloin, and the shrimp and grits. All were very salty. I would not recommend the sandwiches.I've been here several times, and I usually have a great time.  I like that they have a variety of options for dinner.  I like that they are open late, which is nice.  The service is always great and the food is delicious."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is my second time here. The food is good but it's not great. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and the waffles had a lot of rice. The chicken was not fresh and I would not recommend it. I will not be coming back. I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the chef's special, the pork chop with ham and the chicken. Both were delicious and so was the ham. I would highly recommend the pork chop, it was very tender and flavorful. I also ordered a side of fries and they were great as well. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the price point. They do not charge for the bread, which was a bit disappointing."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"So I came a day before closing and the food was good but not spectacular. I ordered the duck confit and the fries. The duck was crispy, not crispy. The fries were ok. The duck was not seasoned at all. The mashed potatoes were very mushy. The sauce was not a very good combination. I did not like the chicken and waffles. The chicken was dry and had a very distinct flavor. The fries were bland and the sauce was not very good. Overall it was a very disappointing experience.I have been going to this place for a long time.  Its been around since the 80's.  The food is always good.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS PLACE!!We decided to try this place for the first time. We had reservations and the place was packed. The hostess was nice and very accommodating.

The crab cake was served with a great sauce and the catfish was fresh. The shrimp and grits were delicious. The shrimp were fresh and the sauce was perfect.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My sister and I took our mom to brunch at this cafe and were immediately impressed by the ambiance. It's like eating in a beautiful greenhouse - very cozy!  We started off with bread baked in a flower pot, nice touch. I think it was brioche, and came with a lightly herbed butter, yum.  2 of us had an egg white omelet and the other ordered pumpkin pancakes.  We also picked at an almond scone.  The food was truly delicious.  My mom and sister ordered hot apple cider which they raved about too.  My only complaint was that the place was very crowded and getting to the front of the cafe for the bathroom took quite a lot of maneuvering around other people. Also, the chairs could be a bit comfier.  Other than that, two thumbs up.  A special place to dine at, and then enjoy some gift browsing in the uniquely stocked store."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This is a cute little pub/restaurant with a very modern feel. The inside of the restaurant is very clean and comfortable and the decor is adorable. There is a full bar inside and a pretty decent beer selection.

I wasn't very impressed with the service we received here. The waitress was nice, but the service took forever. After we were done with our meal we waited almost a half an hour before anybody cleared our plates and got us the check. Although the service wasn't great the food itself was awesome. 

The menu is pretty small and contains a lot of traditional foods. On my last visit I ordered the sautéed shrimp. The shrimp is served in a creamy pesto sauce with linguini and comes out on an interesting looking round plate. It was very good!

With its convenient location and great food, I am sure I will be back. I would love to try a few of the other items on the menu!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Stopped by as part of a party of 5 to enjoy some good food after seeing a movie in the theatre nearby. It was a Friday night, and we were seated right away.

We started with some apps: wings, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, salad with shrimp, a side of fries... if I'd known they were bringing out complementary bread and olive oil, I think we wouldn't have ordered all of that haha. Everything was alright, but I did really enjoy the bread and olive oil.

We ordered two pizzas to split. They were alright. I only tried the cheese and tomato pizza, and my only major complaint was that it had too much cheese and not enough tomato.

To be honest, I do really want to give them an extra star, because our waitress did provide great, accurate, friendly service and checked by with us often (and we did ask for a LOT of stuff). We just weren't really impressed by the food overall, though."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We had a delicious time at stateside. We arrived at happy hour and were served perfect whiskey drinks. We shared a cheese board that was presented with ample sized pieces of cheese, honey, apple butter The thin sliced baguette was super fresh and actually notable.   The happy hour menu boasts dollar oysters that were super fresh and delicious. I also had the broiled oysters that were reminiscent of New Orleans. I would go back to Stateside just to have more of those delicious gems. Our server was upbeat and speedy with our drink refills. The menu at stateside is more of a bar snacks small plates menu with no real entrées but the food they serve is top notch. I'm looking forward to going back and can't wait to try more things on the menu. This bar is charming and pretty cool and that doesn't need to try to hard because it just is really good at what it is."

She seemed confused and not in good mood. I asked if I could speak to the manager and she was very rude. I did not want to be rude and I felt like I was being treated poorly. I felt like I was being treated like I was a burden and not worth the money. I will not be back. I will try other places that are just ok. Excellent food, and reasonably priced. A bit pricey for the amount of food you get, but I'll be back. I'll probably make a reservation for the next time I'm in town."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Loved the ambiance but wasn't impressed with the food. We ordered the Gumbo, the Clam Chowder and the Crab Rangoon. The Clam Chowder was great, but the Crab Rangoon was a bit on the salty side. My boyfriend got the Thai Chicken and said it was very good. I got the Shrimp and Grits which was very good. The shrimp was cooked well but not overly spicy. The Grits were a little salty for me but it was still good. The crab Rangoon was okay. I liked that the crab was a little more flavorful but the Grits were okay. Overall, not great. It's a dive but I'd go back to try the other dishes.They have the best breakfast I've had in a while"

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm not a Cuban aficionado. 
And just like Raúl is a poor replacement for his bombastic brother Fidel, I've had enough Cuban sandwiches that were a poor excuse for lunch.
But Havana Cafe gets right what every other Cuban place I've been to in the Midwest gets wrong - the bread.
What's merely a delivery system for the ham and shredded pork at other restaurants is a cornucopia that cradles the meat and cheese (and mustard) perfectly.
It's somehow grilled to perflakeyness perfection without pounding you over the head with grill marks or the smushing.
Don't get me started on the SMUSHING! 
If I want a panini I wouldn't have ordered a Cuban! Aren't they Eyetalian?!
Havana Cafe is an iconic staple not just of cuisine, but of the growing blended Latino community on Indy's West side.
It's a central hub to the pulsating diversity we didn't know we needed.
I really hope to take my kids here over their breaks so they can experience what a sandwich should be."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"It must have been at least 8 years since I've eaten here. The first time was not memorable and the place was outdated so we never returned. Our friends invited us to dinner tonight and the place looks completely transformed. It looks awesome -- love the flooring, color choices, countertops, etc. The biggest disappointment was still in the food. My husband got the Alfredo pasta and I got the risotto. His tasted like sauce from a can and mine was too hard for risotto. I like al dente as much as the next person but it definitely lacked flavor. I do love the fire cooked shrimp with the heads, I'm the give it to me with all the bones kind of girl. Food always taste better cooked with the skin and bones. I can see this place really being a hit, they have the atmosphere down, they just need to work on the food. (Our friend got the tortellini and it was decent."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"THE GOOD:  The pretzel with spicy mustard.  I've been searching for a mustard like that.  *Super* spicy with a great punch to the snoot which very much resembles that of a good wasabi.  The beer is proper as well.

THE BAD:  The wursts simply don't live up to the price.  I ordered the following the Hot Wurst Platte which is described as follows:

Hot Wurst Platte (for 2-4).  A sampling of Bratwurst, Bockwurst, Kielbasse and German Wieners served with our homemade sauerkraut and red cabbage. Served with German mustards for dipping. 

The wursts were decent, but not the best that I've had by a long-shot.  There are better to be had in Indianapolis.  I've reviewed one in Lawrence that I'd much sooner recommend with a better price-point.  And how do you not offer Currywurst or have curry-ketchup upon request?!

I can appreciate what The Rathskeller is going for.  But, there are some areas of improvement."

I was delighted, the food was great, service was personal, and the atmosphere convivial--I gave them five stars then. It continues to be the only gastropub in the neighborhood. Perhaps some competition would have helped them maintain that quality. 

Six years have taken their toll. The food seems an afterthought now. Over the last year, I've had one too many meals where the food has been undercooked. Nevermind that the kitchen seems incapable of cooking a burger to temperature. It doesn't matter what you ask for, it's always rare. The bigger problem is chicken. Twice I ordered fried chicken, and thrice it was visibly undercooked (I sent it back the first time and the replacement was also undercooked--I settled for a salad). 

Its slow descent south of mediocrity has cost the neighborhood one of its treasures. Alas."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Quaint restaurant in an easily accessible area, with a comfortable seating area.

The menu has a wide variety of unique items. The typical dishes include the vegetarian chicken, pork, and rice. The vegetarian dishes are in a large variety of sauces. My favorite is the Thai heat. I love the spice and the flavors blend together. The curry chicken is a great start to the meal. I love the peanut sauce and the spicy chicken is really flavorful. The prices are very reasonable. The prices are comparable to Chinese restaurants in the area, but the prices are not as expensive.

The service was really good. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a healthy, satisfying meal.I went here for the first time and I had a great time!  The"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"3rd time visiting today. We had the Ribeye which was a nice size portion and was cooked to perfection. The Chicken salad was also very good. The only thing that we didn't like was the outside of the grill. I don't know how that would happen. Our server, Kimberley, was great. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was very attentive. She was very friendly and quick to answer any questions we had. She was very prompt and attentive. We were not disappointed. We will be back!A must try if you're in the area. We were in town visiting and found this place and we couldn't have been happier. I got the sandwich and it was perfectly seasoned."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place is like Miami, it's an old school diner. There is a large menu. There is a huge selection of food. The sandwiches are huge. The burgers are huge. The fries are huge. The customer service is always excellent. The only downside is that the line is long. I had to wait 30 minutes for my food. I was very disappointed with the food. The waitress was friendly and quick to refill water glasses. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good. I got the red snapper, it was okay, but nothing special. I would have gone to a breakfast place that had better lobster mac and cheese. I would not go back. I would recommend it for a good breakfast."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Not much to say about this place, the food is good, but the service is slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I am from San Francisco. This is my first time here and I have to say I was disappointed. I ordered the crab cakes and they were so bland. They were just ok. The fried shrimp was pretty good. The shrimp were a little salty for me but it was still pretty good. The fried rice was really good. I would have liked to have ordered a side of the pork. The rice was okay, but the pork was not very flavorful. The only reason I gave it a 5 star is because of the service. It was not very attentive at all."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Not sure I get the hype. Cory wanted ""Arctic Circle"" flavors this weekend so I figured this would be close. We ordered a single burger with cheese and bacon, (smallest available) medium onion rings and a medium chocolate shake (for me), and the Matterhorn burger combo (for Cory) all for the seems high price of $22!! and some change... 

My single burger was okay, bready and not warm, would have preferred to have the bun toasted instead of cold. Cory said the Matterhorn was good though. He didn't agree with me that a meal at In N Out would be better (and about 50% cheaper). 

For me, it just comes down to the fact it is hard to justify these prices when the food tastes like Sysco frozen goods, especially the Burger King reminiscent onion rings. 

I'm sorry to the loyal followers, this place just doesn't hit the spot for me food wise, shake was delicious though, and something I would come back for."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I go here on semi-regular basis, mostly out of convenience as I prefer to eat at locally owned restaurants over major chains. 

But this place has quite a few options when it comes to burgers and sides. AND the sides are bottomless (or at least the steak fries, sweet potato fries and broccoli). As for dessert - their shakes are fine. The main thing they've got going for them is the fact that they are HUGE. But my favorite sweet is their Mud Pie. It's made mostly out of ice cream. I would recommend ordering it at the same time as your burgers so it has time to soften while you eat your entree. 

The service is spotty. When I went earlier today, it was great. And it has been on many other occasions. But there have also been many times where our service was extremely slow and inattentive. This is particularly frustrating if you really want to take advantage of the bottomless aspect."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I prefer to sit at the full service bar rather than wait in line to order. Our bartender, Marie, was more than excellent, making unique cocktails like strawberry zinger with fresh Louisiana strawberries and an iced pina colada with rum chata and Malibu. I haven't even gotten to the food yet. Come hungry. These Poboys, or ""poor boys"" coined the southern French bread sandwich to feed a 24 local bottling company staff. We love them now more than ever! We had the roast beef and fried shrimp ""poor boys,"" and they were happy to put the mayo on the side. Decadent, crispy, juicy, and flavorful these poor boys are. We also ordered a side of coleslaw and fried pickles, and ate every bite. There are vegetarian options- I thought about ordering the caprese poboy. Still, don't come here to eat light. Be prepared to splurge for CALORIES THAT ARE WORTH IT."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I had the misfortune of my wife bringing home a cream of crab soup from this place. The soup was, without a doubt, the most disgusting soup I have ever had in my mouth. It was totally bland (zero taste!) and had the consistency of wall paste. I asked her if she bought it at Home Depot. She tried it and started laughing out loud...and simply took the container and threw it in the trash. Next up...the crab cakes, which were OK, at best. Certainly nothing to rave about and a far cry from a quality crab cake product.

Look, the only people who could find anything good about the food in this place would be folks who simply have absolutely no idea what decent seafood is supposed to taste like. Quite frankly, Red Lobster has better quality seafood and that place is beyond horrific. Avoid this place at all costs...just hit the drive thru at McDonald's and grab a filet o fish sandwich instead."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I've had bbq similar to this place, and it's pretty good. The ribs are awesome, and the sides are the best I've had. The chicken is okay, but it's definitely worth it. 

The only reason this is not 5 stars is because the service was pretty slow. The place was packed, and it took about 10-15 minutes for the waitress to take our order. This was not a big deal to us, because it was our first time ordering from here. However, it's not a bad thing. I'm not sure why the wait time was so long, but we ended up waiting at least 15 minutes for our food. It took about 10 minutes for our food to come out. It was cold and I couldn't eat it because it was sitting in the microwave"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"So I've only come here once, and the food is good. The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, and the bun is very soft. The only thing I would change is the customer service. I've been there several times and have never had a bad experience. I'm not sure if it's because they're new or because I'm used to them, but it seems they're doing something right. I think if they want to make sure their customers are enjoying their food, they need to do better. I'm a big fan of their bread. I really do like their bread. They have a lot of options, but I like their cheese. I also like their fries. I've never had a bad meal there."

They have great specials on beer, wines, and wine. They have a very good selection of wines to choose from. The food is really good. The dinner menu is a big enough to fill you up. The menu is a little too extensive for my taste. The reason I am giving it 5 stars is because it is not the best food in town."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I don't want to offend a business, but this is your typical hole in the wall establishment. There's nothing negative about that description because the most unassuming eateries offer the best tasting food, Rincon  Alteno is one of them.

When you arrive at the restaurant, there's usually a  long of people. Usually longtime customers. When entering the restaurant you're greeted by a young man who takes your order and gives you your golden ticket. Before Covid, you were able to dine in or take your order to go. They process orders pretty quickly and orderly.

They have a broad menu, tacos, burritos, etc. My usual go to order is the carne asada and chicken tacos. The meats are flavorful and with a slight kick to it. They have an array of salsas, from mild to caliente ( for the adventurous few). I,myself, prefer the extra spicy. 

Don't feel like cooking and craving some good authentic tacos head to Rincon Alteno, they'll do right by you."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I don't know what happened to this place. It was very good 3 years ago when we moved here. I'll make the drive to Sushi Cafe from now on, they are always spot on. 

I hate to say it, but we just had the worst Sushi of our lives from Bonsai. We had take out and literally ended up throwing all but a couple of bites away. 

The topping on the slam roll tasted like canned tuna at best. 2/3 of the sashimi dinner was so chewy it couldn't be chewed (after 2 tries I didn't dare keep going). And the Centipede and Christine's rolls were chewy and tasted way way worse than even Publix or buffet Sushi. 

I've eaten a lot of sushi in a lot of places, but sadly the quality here has gradually slid from a solid 3.5 to 4 out of 5 to just plain inedible. Just wasted $60 and I'm so disappointed to lose having good Sushi this close by."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Took an hour for our lunch to be delivered and everything in it was wrong. Piccantone salad was supposed to have mixed leaf lettuce, radicchio, candied grilled chicken, cherry tomatoes, carmelized onion, candied walnuts, chipotle dressing. What it actually had - romaine, plain chicken, 2 grape tomatoes, avocado, apples. That was it. NOTHING that was described was actually in the salad. La Rucolosa salad was supposed to have arugula, prosciutto, lump crab, shaved parmigiano reggiano, olive oil, lemon. What it actually had - 2 small pieces of crabmeat, shrimp, arugula, and what tasted like cider vinegar. We called to tell them about the problem and they offered us 25% off our next order. We will NOT be ordering from them again so we asked for at least a partial refund. They had every excuse - ""we close out the register at 2 so we can credit your card. The driver left so we can bring you cash. ""

Horrible food, horrible customer service."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We went to the Watson location yesterday.  It took a total of 45 minutes to get our food from time of order.  The place is tiny and tables were filled.  We placed our order and waited 30 minutes for a table to open up then it took another 15 minutes for the crab to come out.  I don't think they were ready for the crowd.  They are expanding the the store next door soon.  We went to the Delmar location the day before and the food came out as soon as we sat down.  There was no wait for a table.  
The food was very good which is why we came back before heading out of town from vacation.   The crab legs are on the small side but very tasty.  There is a 1/4 inch layer of butter at the bottom perfectly seasoned.  The potatoes, eggs, sausage, and shrimp add a nice balance."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Let me enlighten you a little more about the food. I came here for a quick bite and we sat down at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and offered to take our order. She came over and took our drink order. The food came out very fast and was very good. We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were all great. The only thing that I didn't like was the bread they use to make it. The bread was very bland and very dry. Overall it was a great experience. I would definitely come back here again for drinks and food!I'm a huge fan of the sushi, and I've been here twice. I love the Sushi District location, as well as the Santa Barbara location.

My favorite is the chicken tikka masala. The tikka masala is very creamy and flavorful. The chicken is a bit dry but I think it's because the chicken is on the thicker side. I like it when I can get it to go. The chicken is tender and flavorful. The spice level is pretty spicy but I prefer a little bit more spice. I'm not a huge fan of the spice level but it's a little different. The place is not too big so it's a good place to come for drinks and to grab some snacks.

I also recommend the fried chicken and shrimp with a side of the traditional potatoes. The service is very friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable and the food is very affordable. I've been here a few times. I love the food. They have a very good variety of beers on tap. They also have a nice beer selection. I love their location on the beach and the patio.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This rating is for their King Cake I had during the Mardi Gras Season. Oh man, when I saw that the cake arrives in a bright colored pink box--I really could not resist. I loved the way the king cake tasted. You can definitely taste the high quality ingredients used in their recipe which met my expectations that I had from highly trained pastry chefs. The king cake was soft and plush. I liked how they used real butter and how the frosting had a dimension of flavor beyond piles of sugar!  My only complaint was that I think the king cake was a little overpowered by too much frosting on top. As the icing melted off the next day, the king cake was a hot mess. I am not sure if I would get it again because the excess icing on top made it too sweet for me. It is definitely worth a try though. I would give this a solid 3.75 star rating."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Husband took me to this hotel for my birthday. Room not as clean as we'd like to see on first site. Toilet overflowed at 6 and was promised engineering would fix and housekeeping would clean and replace the towels. Engineering came and fixed but housekeeping never came to clean. Wanted to shower after our trip to go to dinner for our reservation but was not able to do so before. Called a third time and was assured that they would be sending someone. We left at 715 and returned to the room around 1 am and it still was not clean with wet toilet water towels on the flip or. Front office attendant never followed through with sending assistance. New staff on duty saw no notes from the prior evening - gave us a new room much cleaner than the first room we were assigned. Experience ruined and left disappointed and appalled as to how we were treated. Problems overshadowed any positive aspects the hotel had.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We used yelp to find this place and what a treat! The smell of fresh fruit fills the air when one walks into the small restaurant. With blenders whirling and a line of 10 hungry souls, we were torn between choices of porridge, smoothies and fruit! My husband had the cashew milk oatmeal filled with almonds, cinnamon, fresh berries and bananas while I customized my oatmeal (his was five stars plus and mine was four based on me not knowing to add cashew milk etc. to duplicate taste) so go with the menu option where they have it down pat! Could not wait to go back next day before flying out. They are about 3 miles from airport. It was 7am and they do not open until 8 on Saturday!  What a disappointment! We were salivating  for one of their fresh berry bowls.   Earlier risers disappointment. Eating greasy eggs and bacon at airport while dreaming of healthy mouthfuls at Backyard  Bowls!!!!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The best and in my opinion the ONLY cheese steak place worth going to in South Philly.  

It's delicious---I am craving the cheese fries as I write this review.  

You know the deal, know what you're ordering before you get to the front.  Cash only.  There's only seating outside.  

It's across from Geno's...which has a picture and letter from Joe Arpaio proudly displayed on one of their walls.  This is because Geno's started a stir when they began an ""English ordering"" campaign and other racist crap that I don't want stirred into my cheese wiz...

Reason's why Pat's is the BEST:
*Everything served is really tasty
*It is THE oldest cheese steak place (founded by Pat Olivieri in 1930)
*It does not have affiliations with Joe Arpaio
*It's adorable and makes me really happy--especially when I think about the long lines after an epic Phillies game
*Open 24 hours, 7 days per week--so you can always get that fix any time of the day or night!"

But hey this new crib is pretty stylish with it's low lighting and pebbled interior.  Servers informed and pleasant but trying a little too hard, it did not feel natural.  Food Ok, octopus taco bore no relation to any octopii I know and not very tasty but they looked nice.  Colleague' stone cooked beef looked great as did colleagues chuckie, all very nicely presented, I just cant remember what all else I ate so I guess it was mediocre.  I did get a side of peppers which I took home and used up in an omlette yesterday. Wasabi martini was delicious and there was a nice choice of sake.  Would stop by for another one of those martinis and a nibble but not go out of my way.  Not sure what it cost as I did not pay."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Came to Rat's for Christmas Eve lunch and really enjoyed my meal. First, our server did a fine job, but I was a little surprised by various staff cursing (one of the hostesses said GDI to another hostess right in front of us as they were figuring out our table, and another staff member dropped the F bomb a few feet away from us when we were eating). Not the biggest deal, but kind of brought down the classiness of the place, I think.

Anyway, I got the escargots for an appetizer and it was decent, although pretty filling (and thus a mistake in a day full of food!). For my entree, I decided to get the seafood salad, and I really enjoyed it! Definitely a big hit with me, and while I ended up too full after eating it, I would 100% eat it again :) Beer selection was fine.

Overall, I would definitely consider coming back here, especially since I still need to tour the Sculpture Park!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Spent two nights at Shepard's Beach Resort. Awful experience. Here's why. Couldn't check into the room until 5 pm even after we were told the room was ready an hour before our arrival. The girl at the front desk was anything but helpful. 

Secondly, the elevator was broken.  I had to haul a car full luggage and beach gear down from the 3rd level of the parking garage and then up six flights of the most putrid-smelling stairwell in 95-degree heat after a 17-hour drive from Chicago.  Literally, a bag of trash was allowed to bask in the stairwell to ferment in the summer heat for days. The valet attendant offered zero help with the luggage. 

Now the rooms themselves were great. Housing staff and Tim in maintenance were friendly. The resort pool area was lively. 

Lastly, no need to bother checking out they will promptly deactivate the key card at 10 am without notice. Check-in at 5 pm, checkout at 10 am remember that."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Excellent specialty rolls (if you're into that) and generous servings of fresh fish on their Hwe Dup Bap (raw fish bibimbap) make this place one of my top Japanese cheap eats in Philly. Not to mention they have one of the best Takoyakis I have ever had (as close as you can get to takoyaki in Japan)! Crisp on the outside and steaming hot and chewy on the inside. Of course, it's nothing fancy and shouldn't be compared to restaurants on the higher end of the price spectrum. For its price point however, it's hard to find any fault in Mizu's offerings. Excellent choice all around especially in West Philly. Side note: It boggles my mind how a place like Vic's Sushi Bar with impersonal service and terrible sushi (with dry rice and rolls which falls apart when you pick them up! Que horror) can have a 5 star rating on yelp, as opposed to Mizu and Ochatto which only get 3-3. 5 stars on average."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is overrated.  I've been twice and dropped $300+ each meal without trying.  However, I do not remove stars for cost so here's the simple truth: you can do so much better in this area.  This is the center of town, near the intersection of Kennedy and Dale Mabry and you have access to all that is delicious in South Tampa to choose from.  There is no reason to choose Donatello unless you are just into bragging about how much money you dropped on dinner to your friends.  The place is tiny, dirty and very old.  There is some neat nostalgia with all of the photos of celebrities when you enter (think every broadcaster, coach or football player to play at Raymond James Stadium), but again I think this solidifies my point that this place rests on its laurels and is living in the past. 

The food is fine and above average, but the place is not appealing to eat in."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I wish I could give less stars. Never had an issue here until the bartender kicked me and my friends out because of the ""dress code."" It's a dive bar. I was hanging out with a black dude who was wearing a tank top. Apparently that's against the dress code. Along with ""hip hop"" attire. It's a thinly veiled racist policy. We were watching the fucking republican debates. For the record, we all work in a non profit law office, and when I've been here with majority white folks, no issues. When suddenly I'm the only white person with other people of color, we're kicked out because someone is wearing a tank top in the summer in New Orleans. Your food is shit. Your drinks are shit. Your appeal is that you're a dive bar but suddenly you have a dress code that you only enforce against black folks (white dudes in there wearing undershirts and hipsters looking like they haven't bathed in months are fine though)???? GTFOH."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,I've eaten in here before and food has been decent. Today I picked up 3 pizzas as a takeout order for a work function. I unfortunately did not look in the boxes before I got back to work. The Brooklyn pie they sent out with me was completely burnt all the way around the crust. I think the thing I am most upset about is that they thought this pie was acceptable enough to have a customer pay $17.99 for it and take it home.  Really Clubhouse???  About a quarter of the pie was eaten and the remainder was tossed. When I called to explain the situation and asked to come back in with the picture of the pie and my receipt the kitchen manager would only  offer me a credit for my next visit. I work hard for my money and I'd rather have the $17.99 back in my pocket. Food credit is not acceptable for me - especially since I won't be back.

Last night I got iceberg lettuce, spinach and romaine mixed together with broccoli, cucumber, blue cheese crumbles, pine nuts, grilled chicken and honey mustard dressing. Delicious! You really can't go wrong since you can get whatever you want! 

The interior is clean and modern and the staff is young and friendly. Parking out front isn't plentiful but I've never been when I haven't been able to get a spot. 

I honestly wish this place was closer to where I live because I would be there ALL the time because they know how to do a salad right and for some reason there aren't too many places like this. I can't wait to go back!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The only reason Devil's Alley doesn't get 5 stars is because it's close to the airport and we've never had a bad experience there. The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it. They also have a good beer selection, which is great for a quick bite to eat. I always get the gyro plate with fries and they are always hot and fresh. The service is always friendly and fast. The restaurant is small, but it's well worth it. I'm from California and have eaten at many different Mexican restaurants in the area. I've never had a bad meal here. The food is good. I've also tried the burritos, chips and salsa, and the burrito with rice."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"If I could give zero stars I would. We waited for a table for about 20 minutes before we were greeted. Our waitress took our order and our food was ready in 10 minutes. When our food arrived it was a bit cold. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and my daughter got the chicken and waffles. I would rate this place a solid 4 stars if I could. Maybe I am biased. However, it was a very busy night and it definitely made me feel rushed. The service was really slow and not very attentive. I was a little concerned about the wait time but that doesn't matter. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick, tasty meal. This is my favorite restaurant in town! I have been coming here since I was a child."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Upon arriving in Clearwater, we were greeted by the very friendly hostess. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, and the portions were very generous. The only downside was that the parking lot was a bit on the narrow side. This was our first time coming here, and we will definitely be coming back!This place is great! Great food and service! I will definitely be back. The pork belly was my favorite. The shrimp and grits were soooo good!I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. I was disappointed with the bread pudding. It was nothing special. I really liked the bread pudding. They do have a decent breakfast buffet. I would go back to this place.I went here for the first time and I had a great time!

Restaurants,2.5,CG,"No complaints for this place, especially for the quality and quality of the food. The only thing that is a little off is the fact that they have a TV with the games on it. We saw a lot of them in the dining room, and it was very loud. If you have a party of 2 or more, the servers will make sure you have a seat at the bar. They have a great menu with lots of different items to choose from. I will definitely be back!We had a party of 6 and the service was absolutely horrible. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table and we were told that they didn't have any specials. We were told that they had some specials and we could order from the menu.

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I would not recommend to go this strip club. The managers over there are immoral and poor conduct. This is a discriminated place that I had an experience. Guys, if you go there using one of your 100 bill, please make sure taking a picture of your money. This place was horrible. They will scam you that you use a fake money to pay them. I had a bad experience last night when I paid with my $100 bill for an entrance fee ($20). The girl there accepted my money, and we got in the place. An hour later those security guards came to get us as that we look like a thief, and they said we paid them with a fake $100 bill. However, the $100 bill that they showed us was completely different.This doesn't make sense at all. As a customer experience, I never seen any places like this. They treated customers like a shit. The managers are  rude. Please beware before going to this place."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm very sorry to give this place a bad review, but dinner last night was one thing after another... 

We didn't get a table until  over an hour past our reservation time, the bartender had short term memory loss and couldn't multi-task, waiter was absent, warm sides were served cold and they F'ed up desert.  It was the hubby's bday and when I made the reservation, the hostess said they would bring out a dessert and sing - that never happened.  

The salad bar at Fogo is better.  Can't personally say anything about the meats (I don't eat meat so I stuck to the salad bar) but the hubby enjoyed it.      

The servers spent a great deal of time on what looked like iPhones - I really hope it was a high-tech drink ordering system.  

Sorry to say but I doubt we will return.  For the price we paid we would have had a better dining experience elsewhere."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Dined her on a weeknight around 730 and it was packed!!!! Amazing how many ppl were here so we knew it would have to be great.

Only complaint was that the tables were so close to each other it was difficult to get up to go to the bathroom or leave when the other party next to you is still seated. Mind you I'm very small.

Tried a bunch of different dishes - wood fired feta was bomb, Brussels sprouts, tufoli with ragu and the fig prosciutto pizza. All dishes were relatively small aside from the pizza so 3 were recommended a person. The feta was out of this world and served to put on crostini. The only thing unsettling was that the olives were pitted....kinda weird and unexpected. The Brussels sprouts were good not great. The pasta was also good not great...sauce was a little dry and the dish came out room temp and not warm. The pizza was spottttt on!!! 

Definitely recommend for a reasonable and cozy/casual Italian spot!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This restaurant is the absolute WORST. Not only did my family get the worst customer service by the young lady at the counter, she wore red glasses but I got food poisoning! As a new mom, you already have so much on your plate & getting food poisoning is not something you want to have to worry about! Also, probably not even a hour after eating at this restaurant, I got sick & I was sick all night! I don't normally do this but please do not eat here. You guys get 0 stars from me (I have to rate 1 star to post my review). I almost forgot to mention, even if I hadn't got food poisoning the food is not worth it. My husband & I left very unsatisfied with the food. We would say the food cost does not match the quality. One of the most disappointing things about this restaurant's panini is there was hardly any meat on our paninis! This place is just horrible."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"To put it lightly: deplorable. We had the crab cakes which were cold and doughy. The crab cakes were basically boiled crawfish. The crab cakes were okay. The crab cakes were pretty much just raw crawfish. The crab cakes were overcooked. I was hungry so I had to wait for a refill. Our waitress, Kimberley, was great. She was very attentive. I just wish there was more to the menu. The crab cakes were a little salty for me. The crab cake was very dry and hard. I felt like they were under cooked. I didn't even know it was crab cakes. I don't know if it was a bad experience but I won't be back. I went to the front of the line to order for delivery and was very disappointed."

We ordered the crab cake appetizer and my husband had the pork chop entree. The crab cake entree was very dry. The pork chop entree was very dry. The soup was very bland and the bread was just ok.

They also have a great wine list and a great menu of beer.  The restaurant is clean and inviting.  The decor is very casual.  

The menu has a variety of options for you to choose from.  You can't go wrong with the omelet, French toast, or the salmon.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 1 is because I was told that their french toast is a must try.  I have to say I didn"

I've always had great service and great food. I like the cheesesteak sandwich, but I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't like. The burger is amazing, too. The burgers are a little too greasy, but not bad. The fries are always crispy and tasty. The location is perfect for a date night or to get away from the airport.I'm a huge fan of this place.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Yes it's a Mexican spot, but if you like wings this place is a must. I didn't even consider the wings until my roommate told me about them, now I'm upset with myself for not trying them out sooner. I've also had their tacos, chimichangas, and burritos and they always load them up with delicious meat and toppings. It's an odd combination eating wings with your tacos, and you wouldn't expect it, but it works and it works really well. Kudos to the owners. 

Prices are great, and the staff is great too. Pretty casual spot, but the food is serious. I think our Mexican food is subpar when compared to other areas of the US. Compared to Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona, Colorado, etc. the New Orleans Mexican food scene is plain bad. Thankfully, El Taco has been able to remedy. It reminds me of some of my favorite spots in San Diego, so I wouldn't recommend any other place for a taco (or wings) fix in the city."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My wife and I ate here again last weekend, and once again the food was fantastic.  In my opinion, this is the best place on the hill.  I'm sure other people have their favorites, but this place is tops in my book for several reasons:

1)  The pasta is all made fresh in house.  You can definitely tell that it's home made, and the waiter infomed us that they have several people who are dedicated to just making pasta for several hours a week.

2)  The prices for this place, while considered upscale, are very reasonable in my opinion.  Most of their pasta dishes are between $15 and $18.  While that may seem a little high, if you've been to Pasta House recently you would realize that it really isn't much more, if any at all, expensive.

3)  The service always seems to be top notch.  

If you're looking for great italian food in St. Louis, you can never go wrong with Charlie Gitto's."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had (sadly) never been to Vietnam Cafe before, even though I've lived nearby for years. (I had gone to once-sister-restaurant, Grill Fish.) 

The space is HUGE. I was really taken aback by how upscale, clean, and big the space was. It's such a hidden gem and I was so thrilled to see it pretty busy on a rainy summer Sunday night.

I ordered the Salt & Pepper Tofu special, which was an extremely generous portion of crisp and salty tofu, tossed with some sauteed veggies. The tofu was near perfect. Every bite had the right balance of salt with the natural tofu flavor. Each piece was perfectly fried and damn near addicting. The plate as a whole was lacking some sauce, though. (But I know that's the style/intentional.)

My BF ordered the Chicken in black bean sauce, which was tasty - and added some much needed sauce to my own S+P tofu. 

The Vermicelli bowls look super delicious and I can't wait to try some of their curries and noodle dishes."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I wouldn't recommend going this restaurant if you're looking for a great dinning experience. This was mostly due to service- our waiter Daniel really ruined our night. He began by telling us what was unavailable as specials for the night, emphasizing that we really missed out. It was really bizarre. He then would disappear for huge lengths of time with our requests being either ignored or repeated to multiple waitstaff. My friend ordered a vegetarian entree, and it was missing two of the ingredients!! Instead of replacing her meal, Daniel brought the shittake mushrooms as a side dish, after she finished her food. She was not compensated and he didn't even seem apologetic for the error. We wanted to end the night on a high note, as it was my friends birthday dinner, and so I requested a dessert with a candle. Nothing ever came and we honestly we just so disappointed, that we went somewhere else for dessert. This is not an Emeril restaurant quality in my opinion."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I ordered on their website. We were told they'd make it in 30 mins. I was pretty disappointed. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers and a side of fries. We ordered the fried pickles and the crab fries. The crab fries were good. They had a bit of a kick to them. I did get a side of the fries with the crab fries. They were just ok. The fries were a bit salty. 

The drinks were good. They had a lot of variety. The bartender was friendly. 

We were not disappointed. We ordered a couple of apps. The wings were okay. The fries were great. The chicken was ok. I like their wings better than the other places. 

The service was good. We're in a rush so we had to wait for the waitress"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I recently moved to Clayton and have been craving a burger for a while now. I was excited to find a burger that was locally owned.  The burgers were tasty and the fries were great. The only complaint I have is that the fries were cold. I don't know how long the cold fries were in my burger, but it was pretty late and it was a little chilly. I didn't mind the fries, but I think the experience was overpriced.This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese.  I loved it.  The only thing that could have been better was the mac and cheese was bland.  But I do love the food and the location.I have been to this place many times over the years and have never been disappointed. My favorite thing to do is get the veggie burger with the tomato"

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"BIG SUSHI

So l didn't really know what to expect but heard of this place being a secret hot spot. My girlfriend's friend suggested it and we came here on a double date. So the prices are fair and l was thinking of eating a little incase I'd empty my wallet and still be hungry like many other sushi places. After our order came, l realized why the place is named Fat Salmon. The rolls are noticeably bigger. Probably around 50% bigger in mass overall. With this knowledge, the prices become very fair lol. So me and my girlfriend split 5 rolls and realized we wouldn't finish it. The sushi in general was great and l always had to bite half of it each time. Environment wise, it was great for a date. A bit corky and trendy. I'm not dating master but l think this place would impress your date if they've never been here before. Service was friendly and I plan to come back here again sometime very soon. https://sphotos-a. xx. fbcdn. net/hphotos-prn1/522117_10100326471226107_1935461251_n. jpg

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant and I love breakfast! Lincoln square in general is a pretty good chain but this owner specifically has done an excellent job of creating a wonderful atmosphere with incredibly friendly and great staff, and always phenomenal food. This Lincoln Square location not only beats the others I have tried, but it also beats out all other breakfast places I have been to! They have the best pancakes I have ever had, excellent fried doughnuts with apple butter as an appetizer, great omelets, benedicts, healthy options, and extensive breakfast menu. I also love the endless coffee and water left and upkept at your table with a variety of flavored creamers so your cup never runs dry. They also have great freshly squeezed orange juice! I have never tried anything here I did not like and I have probably visited at least 20 times. Every time we have family or friends stay the night, we take them here the next morning for breakfast, it's always a winner!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Yes, it's famous. Yes, it's touristy. Would I tell someone to go if they are visiting Nola for the first time? Sure! Will I ever go back? No. So the long line down the sidewalk shouldn't scare you as you'll make it inside in about 20 minutes! That's part of the problem as there's no personal connection with a server for being herded in and back out! I had, of course, The Ferdie! A French bread sandwich with their famous ham, roast beef, and pork stuffed between the slices! Before serving its dipped in the juices for which it was cooked. It's really good, but not outstanding! We also had the Tuesday special of Corned Beef and Cabbage. Bland and bland! No flavor at all and even quite dry! Yes, Adam Richman filmed a episode of Man vs Food here, but for the first time I was wrong following his advice coming to Mother's. Every celebrity known to man has walked through the doors, but how many have come back twice?"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My husband and I have been coming to Ben & Irv's for a few years now. At first he was leery to go, but he's now a fan for sure. We're creatures of habit and once we find something we like, we usually order it over and over again. You can't go wrong with the cheeseburgers, they are awesome! Our second fav is the turkey club, YUM! The 1/2 order of onion rings is actually enough for 3 people, FYI! So good! 
One time I was disappointed though. I decided to mix it up and order a grilled chicken sandwich. Since the burgers and clubs are huge, I figured the chicken would be right up there. It wasn't. The ""breast"" was VERY thin, like a 1/2"" thick. I don't know if they smashed it with a hammer or what. I like chicken sandwiches and all, but I haven't ordered one since. 
Also, Groupons are usually available, which is great. Husband and I would be less likely to visit without the savings."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Not happy at all. We had an amazing time and will be back. Thank you!Very good. We had the burrito and the eggplant parmigiana. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the eggplant was so fresh. The eggplant was cooked to perfection and the texture of the eggplant was perfect. The owner was very friendly and gave us a free dessert. We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed. I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the salmon salad. Both were very good and our server was very nice. The atmosphere is great and the food is very tasty. It is a very unique place and we will be back to try other menu items. I was looking for a new spot for pizza and this place did not disappoint.

She liked it and she didn't like the sandwich much. My wife had the veggie burger. She liked it, but I'm not sure why she got it so spicy. My wife had the chicken wings and they were good.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had high hopes for this place because of its chic, modern decor and cafe atmosphere, but sadly my hopes were crushed the minute I placed my order. ""The Frothy Monkey""...or more like ""The Mean, Hipster Monkey"" to be exact! The cashier had no problem rushing our order and acted as if she would rather serve anyone else but us.  It seems as if our clothes were not stylish or hip enough to be deemed worthy of good customer service. If I wanted to pay to have a complete stranger make me feel stupid, I would have just gone to Dick's Last Resort! I would not have thought twice about this had it not taken 20 minutes to slap together two very simple, cold sandwiches and some salads that ended up being just OK.  This restaurant could be very warm and inviting but instead it is cold and aloof. Not to mention, it seems as if the staff is always stomping angrily throughout the place. Take a chill pill, folks!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"After hearing about this place from other visitors I was excited to try it. So, I stood in line for about 25 minutes to get to the counter and place my order only to find out they were out of beef brisket, so I got the pulled pork and two sides. Pork was pretty much flavorless, and the sauces were piss poor. Ok, the sides, Cole Slaw. Pass on it, it is shredded cabbage and that's it. You know how some places will ask, creamy or vinegar slaw? Jack had to say something along the lines of nah, we'll stop after we shred the cabbage. The mac n' cheese was gross, I don't know how they messed that up. Seriously, Kraft is better. Restrooms were clean, neat place, but, that's about all it had going for it. Food was barely sub par. There was a thick layer of black inedible smoosh on my pork too. I don't know what it was. I won't be going back. It was just such a disappointment."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My husband and I came here for our baby moon. Not my first time on the property. Last night we decided to dine at the local Bistro restaurant. We had lunch here the day prior and were satisfied with our experience. However, last night I ordered a soup that I had enjoyed the day prior. Taste was completely off... and I discovered a piece of plastic in the soup!!!! The wait staff did not know how to handle the situation. I wanted an explanation as to where the plastic came from as I am 7 months pregnant and concerned about food safety. The chef never came out and we had to call the manager. The manager was nice enough and gave me an explanation and did not not charge us for the soup, but I was really disappointed by the experience. I certainly wouldn't expect plastic in my food from a 5 star resort. I can't believe they still charged us for the dinner. Staff is super young and needs better training."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"If you've relocated from the D and having coney withdrawals, you're in luck with this place. You know you're in an authentic Detroit Coney Island when there's a picture of Darren McCarty knocking someone's teeth out. Both our server and the gentlemen who cashed us out were also from metro Detroit, so this place is authentic down to its personnel. 

The chili cheese fries were done right--shredded cheese under a hot bed of chili. I opted for a mimosa since I was getting an orange faygo float for dessert. My boyfriend got faygo root beer (the only root beer he will drink). I highly recommend the coney dog (obviously), the coney special, and the polish platter. Those homemade pierogis bring me back to a simpler time.

Parking is plentiful, as this place is at the end of a strip mall. The location is off 19 just before Tampa road (if you're going south). 

Price is just like back home, CHEAP! Michigan memorabilia everywhere you look. I recommend this place to detroiters AND newcomers"

For this kind of money give me Amada or Tinto ANY DAY. It was like you were in a Mexican Walmart. The space is huge, no intimacy. They would only give us a reservation for 6 pm. Okay not a huge deal. Except when there was NO ONE there. They honestly were at 20% capacity, and they sat us next to a bussing station in an almost empty room in the far back corner. What a load of crap. I LOVE Garces other places, but this was a joke. I would never consider going back. The food was decent but you needed a microscope for the portions, and it was obviously mass produced with no love. I was completely offended that they seated us like they did and when we left, the place was still empty. What poor, poor customer service."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place should have a higher score on Yelp. The food is amazing and fresh, and it has a great atmosphere. The menu has a huge variety of food at great prices. I had a mini entree of chicken parmigiana which is not mini by any means with Orzo chicken soup and fried zucchini. They use a chicken breast not cutlet. The marinara sauce was amazing. I'm a soup person and that soup was comfort in a bowl. My husband had a club sandwich which he enjoyed, and he went on about the French fries. They were his perfect color and texture. Staff was super friendly. Service was fast. Sorry I don't have photos. I get so excited that I always forget to take pictures. If I didn't live so freaking far from this place, I would be a regular customer. My thanks to the owner for not inflating the prices on this delicious food. Discovering a local gem like this is one of the reasons I love going on a road trip."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Hands down the best place I ate while I was in New Orleans. I came with a bachelorette party of ten and we were easily able to make a reservation. Once you walk in the restaurant is beautiful. It's nicely decorated and has a classic vibe to it. Throughout our meal the service was also impeccable. Our sever was attentive, caring and even made some jokes with us.

Now to the best part, the food. I opted for the special of the night which was a lobster pasta. The lobster was broken into smaller pieces and was cooked perfectly. I loved the light sauce & the blend of flavors. I also tried some of my friend's NY strip with frites which was outstanding. For dessert we shared the chocolate tart which was one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. The fresh marshmallows were to die for. 

Overall it was an amazing meal and I would 100% come back again. A must visit if you're looking for a nice, upscale meal."

The food is excellent and the service is very friendly.  The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.  I'm not a huge fan of the red beans and rice but the beans are great and the rice is fantastic.  The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because of the service.  It's not a bad experience, but it's not the best.This place was amazing!! The service"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Finally made it back to the bar and ordered the fried chicken. 

The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauces were spot on.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The fries were crispy and the sauce was a perfect balance.  My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was great!  I had the pork belly and it was cooked perfectly.  I will definitely be back.  I highly recommend it!I am so happy that I found this gem in Tampa. I love their food, the service, and the ambience. I had the Chicken Caesar Salad with it and my husband had the Pork Shrimp and Grits. Both were fantastic. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place.Hands down the best sushi in Tucson!  The service is very good and the sushi is delicious."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"With two small kids at home, I thought we'd try it.

The food was good.  The burrito was a bit small but the flavor was good.  The rice was good.  It was good size, but it was not very filling.  The sauce was good.  The chips were good.  The guacamole was good.  The queso dip was good.  

I didn't like the size of the burrito.  I felt it was a little smaller than I expected.  

The kids were very nice, but we were hungry.  The food was good.  We were in the middle of the lunch rush and we couldn't get enough of the food.  

This is a good place to eat, but it won't be my favorite Mexican food."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place used to be my go-to for Szechuan Chinese food. In fact the chef has been an integral part of some of my favorite Chinese restaurants. We met another family there that had said they've been following the chef around for years. He was really friendly and always gave us suggestions on what specials they just got in; always things that were off the beaten path around here and only seasonally available. That being said, why the three stars? Well the past two times I've been, I haven't seen the chef around and the food's been subpar which makes me think that he's left again. Now they're being spicy for the sole purpose of being spicy. There isn't any taste behind a lot of their dishes now and for the non-spicy ones, it just feels like they've been phoned in. However there are some okay dishes still, like the cold plates (cause you can't really screw those up). Either way I'll be waiting for the previous chef to resurface with a new restaurant."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm really down with Stateside.  A good happy hour is one of the quickest ways to my heart, and Stateside has one of the best.  5-7 M-F the decent beer list, which is already reasonably priced, is half off.  To top it off, dollar oysters are served up by the plateful.

The atmosphere here is pretty cool, they're going for the classy 1950s era where cocktails were king.  The bartenders are dressed smartly, and the whole concept just seems to work.

For the food, none of the small plates are large enough or tasty enough to leave a memorable impression.  It's good at the time; but that's about the best I can say.  I won't be back for a meal any time soon.

The staff is working out some kinks to this new place, and the space is small, but I'm down.  The new American tapas is an interesting concept, albeit a bit pricey.  At the very least, check it out for happy hour before this place gets mobbed."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Previous reviews led us to Merchants on our first night in Nashville. Located right on Broadway in a beautiful historic building, we were able to valet our car at the restaurant and leave it while we explored the music venues after dinner. Despite having no reservation we were seated immediately on the outdoor patio, and proceeded to order two of the most delicious and unique cocktails either of us had had in a while. We ordered off the downstairs menu, although apparently they have a pricier, chef special menu for upstairs. That being said, we were extremely satisfied with the downstairs menu. We ordered  bacon and cheddar macaroni and cheese, fried green tomatoes, and their southern fry, and  while it may not have been the healthiest of meals, it was definitely one of the tastiest. I can't even say which dish I liked best because they were all so good. I would definitely recommend hitting this restaurant before a night out on Broadway, even if it's just for a cocktail and appetizer!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"In Media, PA, every Wednesday evening from May until September, the streets are closed to traffic and the restaurants move their tables outside for the annual ""Dining Under the Stars"" event (http://visitmediapa.com/diningunderthestars).  We were only in Media/Philadelphia for two days, and luckily Wednesday was one of them, so we were able to partake in the event.

Surprisingly, Media has quite a lot of restaurants to choose from, of all different ethnicities.  We were a group of four and each of us had different tastes, but we finally settled on Indian, something we could all agree on.  I no longer remember everything that we ordered, but I do recall everything being delicious.  We ordered several entrees and side dishes to share (we ordered far more then we needed!), a bottle of wine, as well as a couple of drinks, and the bill was really reasonable, around $100 or so.  

I love Indian food, and if I am ever in Media again, I would definitely go back here.

The only downside was that the parking lot was a bit on the narrow side.I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant and was looking for a quick bite to eat.  I ordered the Margarita and the Caprese tacos.  I got the Caprese tacos with beef and the Margarita with shrimp.  Both were delicious and were served with a nice warm tortilla.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I had heard so much about this place and we decided to try it out. I was pretty impressed. The food was amazing. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and great. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fry was on the cold side and the fries were not crispy. We also ordered the spicy chicken and it was good but I wish it was a little hotter. I liked the atmosphere, but I wish there was more seating. I'd definitely go back for the wings though. This is my favorite coffee shop. I love their espresso drinks, coffee, and other beverage options. They have a great selection of coffee and cream. The staff is friendly, and the place is clean. The coffee is amazing and I can't wait to go back and try more of their other coffee options. I highly recommend going here."

The waitress was nice and we sat down.  The food was mediocre at best, and the portions were very small.  The cocktails were good, but I would have liked them a little more.  The servers seemed to be doing their best to keep us in line.  The place is a little small, but I would have preferred to be able to go to the bar and have a drink.  The service was very friendly, but I'd be willing to wait a little longer to get a table.

I had the pork chop with rice and beans, which was not my favorite.  The pork chop had a lot of fat, and the rice had too much rice.  I also had a salad, which was good, but it was not the best I have had."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"If you like bowling alley food this place is on the money...of course this would be a bit rude to a bowling alley. The owner's wife said she knew the dagger was in because they didn't serve breakfast. That's why I'm yelping them!!! Really??? You're going to say that to paying customers? 

We would have been satisfied if the lunch food was good. The quality was just not there. They excuse it by saying there restaurant is small it only sits 100 people. Ok... so Starbucks seats a quarter of that and has a better sandwich. Standards have changed and customers have a higher expectations of a sit-down diner. 

The food was terrible. I.e. The Rueben sandwich had American cheese...served with a side of Ruffles. The taco salad had Fritos on it...I'm sensing a chip pattern here.   I wouldn't recommend this place. Especially not for the rude service. I typically pay and go my way but the rude response of management prompted me to give this review. Way to make a bad impression."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I guess being there with a lot of fairly friendly people that love this bar made me feel pretty snobby.  But there's not too much to like about this place other than it's proximity to the sports stadiums...  ""Beer tower of Bud Light?""  ""I'm sorry, no thanks.""  I looked for the only craft brew on the menu.  ""Can I have a Hop Devil please?""  ""We don't carry Victory anymore.""  Ugh.  Actually, even the hot wings disappointed too and I thought I remembered them being better.  My ""silverware"" was plastic?  The salad has french fries in it, which is kind of tasty in principal.  But if if I want fries, I'd just order them and not a salad...  I even think the fries are overrated.  I guess this place is what it is, and it's a bit overpriced even for what it is.  And I suppose it just caters to it's clientele.  Which isn't me.  Since, maybe I'm a snob..."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I had a decent evening at Dos Segundos. Maybe it's just me being a bit used to the cuisine or my desire to try to find the next big thing. Cantina Dos Segundos fell a bit short from my expectations. The food was solid, but wasn't anything special. I got a wet -chorizo- burrito which was fully loaded all the way through, but it was pretty so-so. I've had better -and more aromatic- dishes from other places that make you yearn for it time and time again, and I think it was the lack of smells that made a big difference. Food had great presentation, but felt lacking in the contents of it.

Drink-wise, I went with the Jalapeno tequila mixer. Fantastic choice for a cold winter night that got you a good buzz going on and a nice burn in the throat, if you're into that sort of thing.

If I return, I'll definitely want to try one of their platters. Portions were huge so you don't have to worry about going big or going home."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My wife and I came here for dinner and drinks, and we did not regret it. It is hard to find a real Cuban restaurant because many claim that they serve Cuban food, but it is not. Alma De Cuba is real Cuban food, and it is just awesome. The prices are high, but you are paying for great good and a trendy atmosphere in Center City. It is a great place to go with a significant other, or a group of friends. I ordered a type of chicken with rice and beans, and my wife ordered a type of steak with a different kind of rice. In addition, we ordered various appetizers and they were all incredible. The wait staff is friendly, but the only thing that I did not like is that whenever you asked them for a recommendation, they simply recommended the most expensive item on the menu. The drinks are awesome at Alma De Cuba, and if you just want a great overall dining experience with great Cuban food, go here!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Why did we wait so long to get our food? I'm not sure, but I'm not sure. The food was good, but the service was not great. The food took forever to come out, and we were in a hurry. I ordered the seafood gumbo and it was cold. The place was packed, and we waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. I didn't mind, but I won't be returning. I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries. I like their chicken wings, but it's kind of bland. It's not like I'm eating it at a fancy place. I like their soups. They have a lot of variety. I also love their mimosas.

The coleslaw was a little dry. I loved it. The corn was a little too sweet, but the coleslaw was just right. The cornbread was a little too sweet, but it was well worth it.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Tried Adriana's for the first time Monday - I have been missing out! 

These sandwiches are HUGE! And delicious. There are so many options, be sure to ask questions if you are unsure what to order. I went with the Sunny's Vegetarian sandwich - Fresh Mozzarella, Artichokes, Green Peppers, Tomatoes, Onions, and more, on Garlic Bread with Pesto dressing. So delicious. The pesto dressing was to-die-for. My Mom got the Ben's special, which is a basic italian cold cut sammie with secret dressing. She really enjoyed it. We speculated that the bread *may* taste better on the grilled/warm sandwiches than the cold ones. 

Sides - The special side of the day was brussels sprouts. I have become a lover of brussels, so I ordered them, and I was not disappointed. These were fresh, and roasted, then tossed with balsamic vinaigrette and fresh red onions. SOOOO GOOOD! 

Everyone working there were extremely friendly and helpful. 

Tip:  Try to go on an off day, as they seem to run out of bread on the weekends fairly often."

A Kitchen Sink: skillet with scrambled eggs, gruyere, sausage, biscuit, gravy, potatoes, peppers and onions. I liked it but felt there was too much potato and eggs on the lower portion. 
Gravy was not so tasty. Biscuit was good but I had better ones. 
Creme brûlée French Toast was the best thing we ordered. Never got such a thick slice of challah bread, vanilla cream was great, lots of berries. 
Pecan Pie French Toast was really good too, with a sticky pecan pie filling, crumbles and lots of pecan. The chantilly cream was really good on top and I usually don't like it. 
Side of bacon: very delicious bacon that is thick but well cooked and crunchy! 

COST: total around 20USD/pax, a bit expensive for breakfast but it was great food!! Would come back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Capone's is the spot to grab a nice craft beer, sit down watch the game, and enjoy some slightly above-par pub fare. The bottle shop carries a decent selection of whatever float your boat; Matt Capone makes a large effort of making sure the tap-list and bottle shop inventory has a little something for everyone. Prices aren't too shabby either. He really cares about his beer!

The food is standard pub fare, however compared to other pubs I'm glad to go to Capone's to not only enjoy what's on tap but what's on the menu; YOU GOTTA GET THE POTATO SKINS. They're not from the freezer, to say the least!

Service is great, homey. Everyone knows everyone. They really care about the customers; a couple couldn't find the keys to their car but happened to have a spare at home which was about 2 blocks away. A waitress offered to drive them home to grab the spare key. WHERE does that EVER happen?! Let's say, not many places.

Sit down, grab a beer & support your local business! Cheers!"

The waitress was very nice and made sure we were enjoying our meals. The manager was very nice and very accommodating. Overall, I would definitely go back and try something else.

After almost a 4 hr drive we get there, check in, and want a nap... I kid you not. I pulled back the blanket to get in the bed and there was dried blood on the sheets. Granted it wasn't a lot... but any dried blood is obviously a bad thing. Even worse than that was the very nonchalant person I called to @ the front desk. There was no appology or any kind of compensation they just sent someone up to change the sheets. Also construction started in the morning while we were still sleeping! Helllllo... its a vacation! I want rest! We had booked the hotel online and already paid for 4 nights and checked out after night 2, it really was that aweful. The only good thing was the seafood restaurant downstairs.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I walked by Süp on my way to another restaurant and decided to put it on my list of places to eat while visiting Reno.  I went today for lunch.  It reminds me of Crepevine in the Bay Area: you order, pay, receive a table placard, find a seat, and wait for someone to bring your food and utensils.  It's an old house turned into a restaurant, so the space is tight, but tastefully done.  The outside seating area was less cramped.  That's where I sat.

I ordered the crab and shrimp salad.  When it arrived, I was like, ""Where's the seafood?""  The salad fixings seemed pretty sparse, but I was actually really full after eating everything off my plate.  The mango vinaigrette was tasty and complimented the salad quite well.  It also comes with two small pieces of bread and a tiny cookie--I don't eat grains so I didn't eat them.

The prices are a bit high for the amount of food, but it's definitely worth a second visit."

I am now sitting at the restaurant  which I have been waiting at least 30 minutes to close out. When I first got here there were only two occupied tables inside. I was not attended for the first 20 minutes. Two parties who came after me ordered before I did. The waitress did not come up even once after taking my order. It was obvious the waitress has a lot going on as there were 11 tables seated. She apologized for the service and was very kind so I can see that it is not her fault more of a managerial issue. The Kobe burger was alright but nothing special.  Will not be coming here again. PS their Bloody Mary mix is trash."

I came here during restaurant week, and the scenery was slightly crowded, the lights were dim and there were candles on every table. I also noticed artsy paintings on the wall and just a overall eclectic setting and vibe.

Our waiter was very nice, he thoroughly went over the menu. We started off with an assorted cheese tray, which featured of course, cheese, grapes, these delicious tasting crackers, cashews and three different sweet spreads.

We also had the crispy spinach chaat, spiced chicken meatballs with basmati rice and naan bread for dinner. Lastly we had an assorted tray of small desserts. 

Everything was delicious here at Indeblue, the spices that they use on the food is divine. It's like a blend of sweet and savory.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time here, service was efficient and I can't wait to go back, especially to try those poutine fries and brunch!"

The waffle was cooked perfectly and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. The waffle was also excellent. The sauce was great. The only negative was the amount of sugar on the chicken. I think they use more sugar than just milk. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The waffle was good, but I don't think I would go back. The chicken was really good and I would say the waffle was a little dry and tasted like it came from a can. Overall, I would say this is a good place for brunch and dinner, but I would definitely not go out of my way for it. The pizza is delicious! The service is very good and the atmosphere is nice."

I tend to stick to my ""usual,"" but recently I've been shaking it up with their medium wings. Meaty, just the right amount of spice, and a zippy little sauce that has complex flavors I can't even describe. Paired with some creamy ranch it's a taste sensation that breaks from the norm of my Italian beef sandwich. I do wish you could mix flavors in an order, but I get that there aren't wing elves swiftly prepping multiple batches in the back, they take time, and making 3 BBQ and 3 hot probably doesn't sound like a good time. 

I'm glad it's convenient, I'm glad the service is prompt, I'm glad they have a map of Illinois, and I'm glad they have big ass cookies every-time I go. The day they're all out? Well that's the day I move back to Chicago!"

One evening, I was walking down the street to go to PHS pop up garden and passed by this place. Instantly, I got excited and asked my friend we would could have dinner here after PHS. We got there and ordered lasagna gnocchi, pierogies, and smoke Roman pasta. When the food came out, I noticed that my gnocchi lasagna had beef in it, and I apologized to the waiter and asked him if he can bring vegetarian gnocchi out for me as I didn't notice that the menu said that it had beef in it. Out waiter without any problem or attitude said ""sure, it's not a problem"" and brought me vegetarian one. I felt so bad and kept apologizing to him and he didn't mind that he had to ask for another order for me. Will def come back here again, all of our food was delicious. I want to try their flat bread next time."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I'm glad I dressed up for this meal because it deserved it. This is what 5 stars taste like. Each itel was a delightful surprise that not only transported me back to my fluffy, yeasty pizza crust travels of Itally and to Morocco or the middle east. Savory peaches, mint with zucchini this is what inspires a Yelp review. Dear lord when was the last time I ate a meal this consistently good with every bite? I don't know but the heat at the chef's counter wasn't just from the stoves. Even the stools at the counter were cushy enough that I wasn't fidgeting through my meal. The environment is dark and loud but it's a perfect place to slip into a crowd as a solo diner, harder to carry a conversation with the cute couple sitting next to you. The space is tight and so not very accessible to those with mobility issues and I am glad I didn't bring my cane but beyond that there isn't a single thing I would change about this delightful meal."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I've been coming to St. Pete's for business for about 3 months. I needed delivery to my hotel. At the suggestion of the front desk clerk, I downloaded a food delivery app and found Ferg's. As soon as I saw the beef on weck I knew I had to try it. WOW! The beef came in a container so I could put it on the weck bun myself. I'm glad it's served this way so the bin doesn't get soggy. There must have been 2 pounds of meat. I exaggerate but when I put the beef on the sandwich it was 5 inches high. The beef was perfect. Shaved. Lean and very good. The au jus it came with was excellent as well. The only thing missing was a side of horseradish. That would have put it over the top. I also tried the potato skins. Equally as good. I liked that they weren't over fried like most places serve them. Overall I give the food 5 stars. Can't wait for the next trip to try the wings."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"You just can't go wrong here. The food is just what you'd expect for a local restaurant. I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little spicy but the flavor was good. The burrito was a little bland but it was just what I expected. I would go back. I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the red beans and rice. They have a great selection of beers on tap. I love the outdoor seating, but I wish they had a patio to sit outside. There's a lot of parking in the back. I love this place! It's very clean, with good food."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Note: $15 per person when you order the half-size plate. The food is good. The drinks are good, but they're not very tasty. I've been to many other Thai restaurants in the area, and it's not really worth it. They don't serve alcohol at the bar. I'd be willing to pay a little more for a different drink if I wanted to drink more alcohol. The prices are very reasonable. The portions are generous. The price is a little high for the portions, but I wouldn't complain about it if the portions were that big. The only thing I would suggest is that you get the chow mein. It's good, but nothing I would order again. Also, don't expect to pay for the rice and noodles."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,This was one of our go to restaurants when we were in town. The ambiance was awesome. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little spicy but the flavor was good. The burrito was a little bland but it was just ok. The guacamole was really good. The service was very friendly. Overall it was a great experience. The only thing I would change is that it was not a good experience. I think it would be better if they gave a different menu.This is my favorite breakfast place in town. The food is always good and the service is always excellent. My husband and I have been coming here for years and the food is always good. I have never had a bad meal here.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This very little casino gives a real feeling of the casino.

The casino is a pretty small building so it's a nice place to stay and have a drink. The casino has a lot of parking and is in a very nice location.

The casino has a very nice decor and a lot of TV's to watch sports. 

They have a lot of TVs but I was not a fan of the TV's that they had. They had a very small TV that was very small. It's not a bad thing, but it just wasn't great.

Overall, it's a nice casino that you can enjoy a drink at. It's a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.They have the best breakfast I've had in a while! 

I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The place was pretty packed"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Dear tourist, 

Do yourself a favor. Every cheesesteak in the city is almost exactly the same. Instead of going out of your way to go to Pat's or Geno's, get a cheesesteak at what ever place is closest to your hotel. Use that cab money to go to Nick's in South Philly. (the other Nick's places just aren't the same) The beef and cheese combo overboard is simply amazing and worth every penny you spend on the taxi to take you to and from. Nick's in South Philly is, without a doubt, Philly's greatest hidden gem. 

NOTE: If you care more about the way the place looks than the way the food tastes, don't bother. It's a dingy little neighborhood dive bar. You are here for amazing food, not because some toolbag artist designed the place. Remember, it's called Nick's Roast Beef, not Nick's Art Gallery. 

Also, to the person below who complained about them not having a booster seat for his one year old child. Here's an tip: DON'T TAKE YOUR ONE YEAR OLD CHILD TO A BAR!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The Cucumber Margarita ($6) is delicious, the Chips & Salsa ($2.95) is good, and the so-called Mardi Gras Indians tacos ($7) are mind-blowingly good. Those three items are what I ordered on my first visit to Juan's Flying Burrito, and based on their quality (and the low prices) I decided this was a great restaurant, full stop. However, on subsequent visits I've ordered things like the Super Green burrito ($6.95), or the Jerk Chicken burrito ($7.50), both of which I found fairly flavorless, gummy and unpleasant. These misgivings have been confirmed by friends of mine, who have had similarly bad experiences at Juan's.  I guess I got lucky the first time. So I have to give this place an average review. However, if you stick with the Indian tacos and the Cucumber Margarita, you can't go wrong. I haven't tried everything on the menu, as I haven't been back that much recently. Juan's Flying Burrito is hard to recommend strongly, but it's certainly a solid ""Mexican"" joint with capable hipster waiters, and the prices are hard to beat."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Came here for lunch and sadly wish I chose a different restaurant. We came early noon on Valentine's Day and asked to be seated in a booth but the host told us there were reservations of Valentine's Day which we completely understood, but the next couple who walked in also asked for a booth and they were seated at a booth. They seated us all the way in the back. Ordered crab cakes which was a mistake, there were no crabs in it and lacked any flavor. Should have known to only order seafood at a seafood restaurant. We also ordered the grilled tenderloin salad and asked for medium rare, the steak came back as rare. Food was disappointing. Service was mediocre, waitress was attentive but also sounded like she had a stuffy nose or just woke up and rolled out of bed. I probably should have listened to some of the reviews on here but was hoping that it wasn't as bad as people were saying. Overall, a disappointing experience and probably never visiting a firebirds location again."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I just went here for the first time with my husband and my mom. I got a vegan green curry. My husband had beef Pad Kra Po. My mom had a special duck entrée. We shared spring rolls as an appetizer and a special chocolate soufflé dessert. We all enjoyed the food, even my mom who has never had Thai food before and a picky eater such as myself. (I actually tried a bite of everyone's food and liked it all!) Everything tasted very fresh. 

The atmosphere is warm and cheerful, as is the staff. The bathroom was comfortable and spacious; it was also very clean (impressive for a very busy Saturday night).

I was going to give this place 4 stars but when I think about it, I'm not really sure how they could improve. I'm not at all an authentic Thai food connoisseur but this place is a notch above your standard Thai place when you consider the fresh ingredients, cleanliness, and excellent service. 

This is a lovely place for enjoying a casual meal with friends and family."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Decent spot for beers and wine. The menu is a bit limited but they have a decent selection. I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little tough to chew and it was very chewy. I think the burrito could have used a little more flavor. I will be back. This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good. I got the red snapper, and it was good. The bread was good. The bartender was very attentive and polite. I would definitely go again. This is my favorite restaurant in town! I have been coming here since I was a child. I have never had a bad experience."
Restaurants,5.0,CG,"I'm a little late in the game, but I've heard about this place for a long time. I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was amazing. I wish I'd gotten a side of mashed potatoes as I don't like mashed potatoes. The service was great and I'm glad I made it to the restaurant. I will definitely be back. Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch, but the decor is absolutely gorgeous. We sat at the bar and had a great conversation. We ordered a couple of different things from the menu. I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger. The bacon cheeseburger was awesome. My husband was a little disappointed in the bacon cheese burger, as he thought it was very good."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"So in honor of Hispanic weekend, I thought we'd take a chance on a small local restaurant.

I had the Chicken Tinga and the Tinga was very good.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the beans were tender.  The beans were also very flavorful and a bit sweet.  I added a side of house made rice to add to the dish.  My husband had the pork belly tacos and he loved them.  We also shared a side of the spicy salsa which he enjoyed as well.  I loved the salsa bar, which is a big enough spot to have a few different kinds of salsa, but also not overwhelming.  We also shared a Tinga and we both enjoyed it.  The portions were generous and I would recommend it for a casual lunch or dinner.

I highly recommend going to this restaurant and stopping in for lunch or"

Definitely a must try place to visit if you're in the area.Lovely place to grab a quick bite to eat. We went on a Monday night and were seated immediately. The service was great, our waitress was super attentive, and the food was delicious. The portions were generous, and the prices were reasonable. They have a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, and sandwiches to choose from. I loved the chicken tikka masala, and I was impressed with the spicy chicken korma. I'm a huge fan of the chutney,"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food is not the best Indian food in Philly, but it's always solid, and never disappoints. It varies very little from visit to visit, I've never gone home disappointed. Their buffets are pretty great deals at $8 and $12 for lunch and dinner respectively, I don't think I've ever ordered a la carte.

As for the buffet, it's refreshed often, everything is always hot and fresh, and as stated, the quality varies little from visit to visit. It's also a nice touch that they include a dessert; I always get the kulfi, which is rich but the tiny portion is just the right amount of sweet for the end of a meal.

The waiters are, I think, mostly used to the buffet crowd, so they're either too present at refilling your water or hovering over your plate to take it away, or they're totally absent and it's nearly impossible to flag one down when you want to pay. Still, since you're mostly left to your own devices, which is nice, and this is always a good standby when in West Philly."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place is the real deal if you want a GENUINE Italian ""Brooklyn"" style store. Mama is a gem! She is the personification of an Italian Grandmother! Once she gets to know you expect a big loud, gleeful greeting, with a hug and a kiss! Of course her family works with her, and they are a wonderful group of people as well!. Been coming here for years. I make the drive from St. Pete, right past Mazarro's all the way to this remarkable little store! They have deli cases full of house made goodies like sausages, pepperoni, meatballs, and other ready to cook foods, as well as antipastas', and Boars Head sandwich meats. There are frozen ready to eat meals as well, just pop them in the oven. The store is also stocked with Italian groceries, cookies, wines, olive oils, etc...

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Apparently, this isn't really the place you're supposed to go for cheesesteaks anyway, so I'm not going to let that color my opinion of cheesesteaks in general since this was my first experience with them. 

I ordered the Ishka burger without cheese (mushrooms, onion, and peppers with pizza sauce). Oh no. This was one of the worst burgers I've ever had, the whole thing was just gross. I was still kind of buzzed from the bar too, so that should really tell you something. I tried a bite of my friends cheesesteak and was disgusted. Why is it so dry?? And the flavor...I can't describe it any other way but to say it tasted ""dirty"", almost musky. Don't ask me what that means, because I have no freakin clue, but I desperately wanted to rinse out any memory of it from my mouth. So I took a sip of my friends Gremlin (half grape soda half lemonade) and proceeded to have my taste buds seared off by the blinding sweetness of it. The whole experience was just a horror show."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"A new resident to Fenton, my family took me here for brunch on a Sunday mid morning. Inside is a small store full of random holiday decor, jewelry, and snacks/candies. As we arrived through the front door, we were greeted by the host who took our names and were told a 25 minute wait. My boyfriend and I found ourselves amused at the little gifts they had on display. The wait was not unbearable (actually better than I've experienced on a Sunday) and we were seated sooner than we knew. 

I looked over the menu and the fried boneless chicken caught my eye. My party of 4 all ordered it. Surprisingly, the food arrived shortly and I tell ya... that was the best boneless fried chicken I've had in a while! My macaroni was a mouth full of cheesy goodness and although I've had better corn bread, it complimented my meal well.  Our server was friendly and kept her composure on that busy day. 

All in all, Cracker Barrel, this won't be the last time you'll see me :)"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"A solid 3 stars. The server was nice and attentive. I will return for sure!Very good.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were good. I had a burger and fries. I did not like the chicken and it was a little bland. I liked the fries better than the chicken. The burger was very good and a good size. The fries were very good too. The salad was good too. I'm not a huge fan of the red beans and rice but the coleslaw was good. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the price. I got a $5.50 deal for the fries and I was charged $4.50 for the red beans and rice. That was a little over priced but the food was really good"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"You know the soup guy, he's the best. I always order the Chicken Curry and he's so so. And I also get the Tandoori Chicken and that's it. Oh, and they also have a very good variety of desserts. I always get the mango chocolate cake and it's amazing. I think this place is a good place for a quick lunch or a quick snack. I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries. I like their chicken wings, but it's kind of bland. It's not like I'm eating it at a fancy place. I like their soups. They have a lot of variety. I also love their drinks. I really like their vibe. They have a good selection of drinks."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I'm going to be brutally honest, I thought the fried chicken was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of the fries. The fries were crispy, and the bun was very soft. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor, but I can't imagine I'll be back. The wings were a bit too spicy, and the flavor was lacking. I didn't think the wings were very good, but I guess I'm used to that. 

Overall, I think the service was good, but I'm not sure I would go back.This place was great! We ordered a lamb shank and a chicken shank. The lamb shank was tender and delicious. The chicken shank was juicy and flavorful. I ordered the cauliflower and my boyfriend ordered the lamb shank. Both were delicious and the cauliflower was the best we have had.

Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Desperate to satisfy our craving for diner food ever since Geet's shut down this summer we drove the extra few miles down the pike to Peter's.  We went on a Saturday at 11am and it was not as crowded as I expected.

My husband ordered the western omelette and asked for no cheese.  It came with cheese.  My egg, sausage, and cheese on a bagel was huge, but nothing to write home about in terms of flavor.  My bagel was rather stale as well.  My daughter did not enjoy her french toast, claiming they were very chewy.

My biggest gripe would have to be the ants crawling on our window sill and onto our table.  Our waitress was definitely over-worked because she did not come to our table once since we got our food.  

We have eaten at Peter's diner quite a few times in the past 10-15 years when we in the area.  I was really hoping that it would fulfill the empty void that Geet's left us, but so far, not so good."

Let's pretend Evil Genius didn't have awesomely funny names for their beers.  They still tasted great.  My favorite was ""sliding in the DMs"" The atmosphere is relaxed and the seating area has tables full of card games.  We went on a Saturday at around 3:00 and it wasn't too too crowded.  We had to wait maybe 10 minutes to find a seat.  By the time we left around 5:00 it was a lot more crowded with a line halfway to the door.  I'm only sad I don't live close enough to come back regularly (I used to live just down the street, hey Temple U!) But when my friends ask me for recommendations of places to go when visiting Philly, I will definitely add this to the list.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I went there recently and ordered a ""Griller"" sandwich with just cheese...a simple grilled cheese if you will. I cannot stand it when I walk into a sandwich shop and the only vegetarian option is cheese and avocado. Don't get me wrong, I love those things, I just think it is so boring. I on the fly opted for a grilled cheese (which isn't on the menu, no vegetarian options for Grillers at all actually). It was a sad sad sandwich. Granted I could have walked the server through better however I found it to be weak that what I ordered posed as something so hard to complete in the first place. The server put very little cheese on it so that was a let down, yet he already toasted it when he showed me so I felt asking for any more would be futile. I will stick with other sandwich shops from now on, or think well in advance on what I can have them create for me so I can not be so clueless as to what to order."

I got the fried oysters and the shrimp was a little salty. I liked my oysters better. I think it was just too salty for me.

I had the salmon with pork belly and it was delicious. I will definitely be back for sure. The only downside is the location, but the service was great.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"First time trying this place was after a frat party @ UCSB. I would hear everyone say FREEBIRDS! (had no idea since I'm from LA and we didnt have one yet). Line was ridiculous so either figured its really good or its the only spot open late at night!.. Well once I took a bite of my Steak Burrito I realized the long lines were due to the amazing taste. So then of course only place that came in mind of comparison was Chipotle and still till this day I think is better than Chipotle for 2 reason... 1)Steak has a much better taste 2) there burritos are way bigger and they are not greedy with any items you request on whatever you get


For some reason this place is way better than the new location in LA (USC). Taste (steak does not taste the same) and horchata (way different taste and they dont sprinkle any cinnamon on top!  =(  what the hell!) Another difference I noticed was LA location has different burrito sizes from Hybrid to SMS (Super Monster Burrito)"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Where do I start...I really don't like giving 1 star but this place gets one. A few coworkers told me this place was great.We spent about 25 which at lunch is so ..so..for two she had the buffet and  I had the pollo ripieno which was over cooked and bland very disappointed I am from Chicago and have a background in Italian food my grandmother is full blooded Italian and I worked for a few pizzerias as a cook.Like I said I hate to be so harsh but come on no flavor on anything.Moving on the buffet have only four things 3 hot pasta dishes 2 were cold and the pizza was cold and had next to no sauce and no flavor  .Moving on...the service was terrible for that alone I will not go back I will not name the server but she was snippy and rude and short with us not family friendly it was very hot in the restaurant. The only good thing was the bread which is sad to say.I will never go back to this place.

And yes the food was good (ill get to that later) but I couldnt get over the atmosphere. I thought I could eat there but it is definitely a take out place. The byo is so awk and do it yourself.

I went with a friend and we didnt order a lot of food and I think they were talking about us. I'm sorry between it being earyish and the wine...we didnt need multiple rolls and apps etc!

Our rolls were delicious though. Volcano - anything with spicy tuna is great. The mango roll too. And they had many I'd like to try on their specialty list. I didn't get it this time, but also who can beat 3 rolls for $11 for quality sushi (8 pieces too!). But I would stay away from apps. Our edamame was packaged for delivery and then just put in a microwave. Same with miso soup and salads we saw others eat."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I went to the Bala Cynwyd location. I had the spicy garlic noodles with chicken and beef, also had a fountain drink, total was $14 and change. I wasn't impressed, at all. The food is edible, but don't get any meat, it's all dry, no flavor and not marinated and the portion was half a bowl. The cooks don't actually cook, they just heat up the ingredients and put them in a bowl. I added spinach and sprouts to my order and had trouble finding them through the noodles. I think I had 3 leaves of spinach, very disappointing. The fountain drinks offered are not name brand, like Coke or Pepsi, they are generic cola with a Honey Grow stamp, that are no better for you. They portray a healthy menu, but force cheap soda on you without the option of fresh drinks. I would hate to order one of their other drink options after seeing that the food is only warmed up there, not actually cooked. I wouldn't recommend this place. Even with the small portion I didn't finish my meal."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I stop in from time to time and the food is good. 

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries are crispy, not crispy. The fries are thick, not crispy. It's a fryer. They are thin and mushy. The sauce is not a mustard.

I would also like to add that they are a little pricey. They are just a few cents for a few items on the menu. I think that's a bit high for a fast food place. The burgers are good, but they are not as good as the other places I've been. 

I'll be back.I went here to get a pizza and I was disappointed. They didn't have any meat or toppings. I ordered the pizza and it was a little dry. It took 15 minutes for my pizza to come out. I asked for the manager to come over"

I love to get extra tomatoes and green peppers on my pizza but my husband likes other toppings so we always get two pizzas and are happy to have leftovers.  I believe Puccini's was formed over 20 years ago from former Bazbeaux employees; it says a lot that Puccini's has been successful for this long.  They have super fun and imaginative custom artwork on the walls of their restaurants, with plenty of booths and large tables, but we seem to always order takeout.  The salad is fairly basic but they have a homemade 'ranch' that is super garlic-y and is a must try and crowd-pleaser.  This location is conveniently located near many neighborhoods and on those nights when you don't want to cook or drive far we usually think of Puccini's.

I fell in love from the moment I walked in. The atmosphere is grand and everyone is excited as they love what they do.

We really enjoyed the fact that the Executive Chef, Dan will come out and discuss other options that are not listed on their menu. Its called the Walking Menu.

We ordered the Italian Flag. This was not listed on the menu. It was three different pastas in three different sauces. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!!!!!!!!

We also order the Caesar Salad. It is not your typical Caesar Salad- it is 10x better. Dan, lives up to his father's tradition and interacts with each table- including throwing cheese balls into the bowl from 20 feet away!

It is obvious that Dan takes this restaurant very seriously and it shows. According to my husband- this has been the best Italian Food and Caesar Salad ever (I can not disagree). This is coming from a man who does not eat green vegetables or salads.

Dan and the staff- Keep up the great work!!!!! You all are AMAZING!!!!!!!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went to eat here on October 26, Saturday morning and the guest service was amazing! I believe there were some new staff but they were amazing! Our server Mama ( I believe that was her name being called while being there) was amazing! She was sweet to my grandparents and asked if everything was good and if we need anything else. The TEAM overall were good under pressure and they deserve a pat on the back or a RAISE! I worked in a fast casual dine in and I understand how they feel under the pressure but man! I wish employees from California would have the same attitude and motivation like these people! Food was delicious! Like yes, I can make it at home but this is like a whole new world to me! One of the staff spoke to us while we were leaving and let me tell you!!! I will be coming back to this place even if I'm rooming across Nashville or even there for an hour! Go eat at this place and trust! Your food are in good hands!!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I feel so sorry for the poor service. We ordered two pizzas for 2 people and one to go. The pizza was cold, the cheese was stale and the crust was cold. We had to ask for the manager to check on the pizza. This was our first time coming here and we felt so bad for the poor service. I can't believe we waited so long for our pizza and food. This is not a place we would go to again. We won't be back.We have been eating here for the past year, and the service has been slow. I usually go for the lunch buffet but today I went for lunch. The food was great, but the server was very rude. He told us he would ""get us out"" and didn't even bring us a drink. I asked for a refund and he made no attempt to get a refund. We had to go to the bathroom to get"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I took my dad to eat here and the food was good. 

The only thing I would change is the fries. The fries were crispy, not crispy. The sauce was ok. The lettuce was not fresh. I would think it would be better to just add ranch. 

The place was clean and the owner was very friendly and gave us a free appetizer. I would give it another shot. 

I will be back.This place is great!  I had the lobster mac and cheese.  It was very good.  I got the red snapper, and it was good.  The bread was good.  We were there on a Saturday night, and the place was packed.  It was a nice surprise to see a new spot open.  We'll be back soon.This place was good.  I would give it four stars if I could. "
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I was born and raised in New Orleans and we love this place. The food is delicious and we always get the burrito. The service is also great. We love it.I'm so excited to come here.  I've been coming here for years and it's always been one of my favorite places to go to when I'm craving a good Chinese food.  I love the food here and the portions are huge.  The service is friendly and quick.  I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, but I will definitely come here for Chinese food.  This place is super fast and the food is really good.  I've only been here once and it was good but I would definitely come back to try it again.  I also love their fried rice and fried pickles!  I also love their spring rolls!  My only regret is that I don't like their fried rice."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"After running errands, me and boyfriend were hungry, with a hankering for a good ol' cheese steak. We were driving around the neighborhood,  and have passed Steaks n Shakes hundreds of time, so we decided why not.

The reason I love Yelp is because your reviews, Yelpitos, help me out so much with local eats! We were kinda just standing there, wondering what to order, looking at the menu, kind of apprehensive because we didn't know anyone who could attest to the food. Then, lightbulb! I checked on Yelp if there were any reviews and there you were, singing praises about the quality and taste of the cheese steaks. So, thanks to you, we got the 2 cheese steaks special (comes with fries and a 2 liter) to go.

We got home opened up our food packaging,  and we're pleasantly satisfied: soft yet toasty roll, nice amount of meat and melty cheese, wonderfully hot and crispy fries, and washed all that goodness down with grape soda. 

""It was good,"" he said. I think we found ourselves a new steak joint in the hood, y'all."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a romantic and upscale place to celebrate our vacation to Nashville. We passed Deacon's while walking downtown, and it just looked gorgeous. Our Uber driver later confirmed that it would be an excellent choice.

We went on a Friday night, and couldn't get a table. We sat at the bar, which was absolutely fine, and still gorgeous. The service was outstanding, and the food was like a flavor explosion. We started with gumbo and Brussel sprouts, which were both to die for. I think the sprouts could have been cooked just a bit longer, but the flavors were so unique and wonderful that it didn't matter. I had the shrimp and grits, and the shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection. The dish had compressed apples as well, which were something I've never tried, but complimented the meal with a fresh, sweet, acidic flavor. My boyfriend got a huge NY strip steak, and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned so nicely. 

The cocktails were outstanding as well. We will definitely go back, next time we are in Nashville!!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love this place. Bit pricey, but I think it's well worth it.

The cake is to die for. The fresh strawberry cake is great and so is the lemon raspberry one.  I'm not big on German chocolate, but my BF's dad - a German chocolate fan - was very happy with it.

The crepes are great - I worried at first that it might not be big enough for a meal, but I worried for no reason.  The sandwiches are great as well. My friends prefer the pre-made to-go railroad sandwiches over the freshly made ones; something about the ""slightly stale"" bread makes it better, they say.  The chicken white chili (? I forget the exact name) is excellent in chilly weather.  The freshly squeezed juiced is a bit over priced (~$5), but my friend swears by them - I've never had the courage to cough up so much dough for a glass of non-refillable juice.

The pastries, cookies, and other little bits of sweet-goodness displayed in the glass case make you into a kid in a candy store. Approach with care..."

I came here for lunch with my boyfriend. The staff was super nice and the food was great. We got the chicken teriyaki bowl and the rice. I got the salmon with pork belly and it was really good. The portions are very generous. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the pork belly was very tender. 

We also got the red snapper, and it was good. The red snapper was spicy, not to sweet, and had some great flavor. I would recommend this place for those of you who are not into spicy food.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Stopped by one evening to grab a bite to eat. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the fries. The sandwich had a nice, thick cut of brisket, a great amount of onion, and a little bit of smoked sausage. The fries were ok, but nothing special. The brisket was a little tough, and it seemed a bit over cooked. I think the bread was a little dry for my liking. I think it was just too salty for me. I think I would go back for the brisket sandwich, but I won't get the pulled pork sandwich.

Overall, it was a good meal. The place is small and not as big as it used to be. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Nashville.There was a large party at the bar. Our waiter was very nice. However, the food was terrible. We ordered the chile relleno and the chees"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,All in all the food was tasty and the service was good. The only thing I would change is the dessert. The ice cream is the best part. The dessert is so worth it. The only reason this is not 5 stars is because the service was not great. The waiter was very busy and seemed to be overworked. I think the manager could have been a little more attentive. Maybe he was just working too hard. It's very sad that they lost a star because of all the good things about this restaurant. This place was great! We ordered a lamb shank and a chicken shank. The lamb shank was tender and delicious. The chicken shank was juicy and flavorful. I ordered the cauliflower and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits. Both were incredible. My shrimp and grits were served with a very good sauce and the sauce was very flavorful.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was so happy to find this restaurant. The food was excellent, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the owner took the time to stop by the tables and check on the guests. We started with the Chicken Satay. It was delicious. Then we tried soup - Tom Yum and Tom Kha Gai. I honestly can't say which I liked better. They had interesting and rich flavors. After the first two courses, I doubted we would be able to eat our entrees of Padd Kea Mow with chicken and Padd Med Mamwaung with duck. The first taste of the ""drunken noodles"" in the Padd Kea Mow was heaven. I couldn't stop eating, even though I was full. Looks like finishing it would not be a problem. It was AMAZING.  The duck in the Padd Med Mamwaung was deliciously lean, tender and succulent. The complex mix of flavors in the dish may make it one of my all time favorites. But that remains to be seen. We plan to go back until we have tried most of the menu. 
Thanks for opening this gem!!!!!"
Restaurants,1.5,OR,"I go to this McDonalds sometimes after work, but today I went before I had to go and I'm a little disgusted. I had placed a mobile order about 5 minutes before I had parked, but once I got there, I had waited about 20 minutes for literally a spicy crispy chicken sandwich and a medium fry! I was about to go inside and ask what the issue was or just pick it up inside but right as i got out of my car, the bag came outside and i got handed the food. i wasn't even told anything! i looked in the bag, tasted a fry, it didn't have any salt and were old and stale! i also took a few bites of the sandwich and it wasn't even cooked all the way through either! the meat had a resistance to it and felt like i was chewing on putty.. i tried to call, got no answer. i couldn't go back because I have to go into work but i'm overall disgusted with todays order. i've never had a problem with them until now..."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm not big on chain restaurants but my boyfriend and I always do dinner with his dad every Friday. Boyfriends dad loves Texas Roadhouse.. so I put on a smile and end up going to Roadhouse at least 2-3 times a month. We always try and call ahead before we leave the apartment. Several times we wait for about 10-15 mins. Which isn't bad at all. Sometimes the hostess stand doesn't look organized, but I understand working in a busy restaurant. I'm not a big steak eater so I always order the 5oz salmon. The salmon is perfectly cooked medium and you can choose what size you want, which I like. The rice is my favorite. It has a lot of flavor and is a perfect side with any fish dish. The service is 50/50. Sometimes we get great service other times we don't. I rarely see the same staff so I wonder if they go through servers quit frequently which can happen in the restaurant business. Over all this restaurant is great for families and easy on the wallet. We will be back again!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,The atmosphere and service was perfect. The food was just what we needed! The best part of the meal was the drinks! I got a shot of the Treme Margarita and it was AMAZING. The server was a bit overwhelmed but he was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this place!One of the best restaurants in the city! I had the pork chops and it was great. The pork was tender and flavorful. The shrimp and grits were delicious. The service was friendly and fast. The decor is very modern and very comfortable. I recommend this place to everyone. We have been here twice. The first time we ordered the lobster roll and the second time we ordered the lobster roll. The lobster roll was amazing and the lobster was cooked perfectly. The lobster was a little dry but still the best part of the meal. My husband had the crab cake and it was very good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The Shake Seafood was okay. Not sure if the shrimp was cooked properly or if it was frozen. The other two we had were the wings and the fried chicken. The wings were okay, but the fried chicken was not good. I would not recommend.I really enjoy this place. The decor is a bit old-school and it's a bit loud. But I think the food is good and the staff is very friendly. 

I ordered the beef tenderloin and my boyfriend got the veggie pho. Both were very good, but I was disappointed with the veggie pho. I think it would have been better with a little more soy sauce. The broth was good, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. 

We also had a special, a special pho with pork, which was very good. The pho was small and had a little bit of pork"

It was great. The bread pudding was fluffy and delicious. I will definitely be back for dessert. 

The dining room is small but very cozy. They also have a great wine list. We loved it and will be back.This place is amazing. They have a great selection of sandwiches and salads. The staff is friendly and helpful. It is a cute little spot and I recommend it. My only gripe is the wait time is a bit long but it is worth it. I love the location and the food is great"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Don't you love when you have an unexpected good meal? Indian food wasn't on our agenda visiting the South from the Northeast -- we'd been subsisting in fried chicken + sides exclusively. But this was one of the only restaurants open on Christmas Day (trust me, I spent a good amount of time calling all the asian restaurants on yelp, after giving up on others. kitchen Notes was our second choice!), and so here we came. 

For $13 with tax and tip, we had a mighty delicious meal. Included in the buffet 
-Naan 
-rice and lamb biryani rice 
-korma with vegetables - cashew based, so delicious and buttery! 
-other curries incl spinach, a delicious 'desi chicken' one with chicken meat falling off the bone 
-tandoori chicken 
-sweet and spicy fried chicken we oddly enough enjoyed, for the batter 
-fresh fruit and dessert 

We were so full we didn't need to eat dinner (this was a trend during our trip)

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My girlfriends decided to have a girls night at this new restaurant that had caught our eye when we past by and saw their menu before their opening day. Making a reservation was easy! We sat in their patio area, which was really nice on a Friday evening. The server was attentive right away and answered all our questions. I decided to order the lobster gnocchi, which at first I was skeptical of because it is not like the gnocchi I've had in the past. Wow! It was really good! All the elements of the dish worked really well together. I am definitely ordering again! Now let's talk about the drinks! Apart from their creative names they are really tasty! I highly recommend the Basil Fortuna! The manager, Ricardo, also stopped by our table to ask how everything was- you rarely see this and it was highly appreciated! After our dinner, we decided to step inside and have one more drink at the bar. The ambiance was great! We did not want to leave!
All in all we had a great girls night out."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Someone please, tell me why this place is still in business??? When I walked up to the door, I could smell no smoke. That in itself was a bad omen.  I ordered a short end rib sandwich, the time is around 2 pm.  Fifteen minutes later, I'm still waiting for my food even though there was only one person in the store other than myself. The customer service is abysmal. I go home to eat the sandwich and I'm totally disgusted after the first bite. The ribs tasted as if they were parboiled then cooked in the oven, not hours in a smoker. The sauce was a sugary ketchup mess. Is this how they barbeque ribs in the South? I think not. It was then I remembered the vow I made several years ago to never patronize this place again. I won't forget the next time I want barbeque!

I'd give this place -5 stars if it were possible. If you want real smoked barbeque and good customer service, go to Deke's, Sweet Lucy's Smokehouse or even the Rib Crib, just don't go to Dwight's!"

The salmon was cooked perfectly and it was cooked perfectly. We also had the chili garlic burger. It was a very good burger. We also had the salmon sliders. They were good. The breading was not as thick as I had expected but still delicious. For dinner we had the shrimp fried rice and the shrimp po-boy. Both were good. The shrimp fried rice was good but the po-boy was very bland.

My family also had the gyro plate. They were very generous with the portion size and the meat was very tender. The rice was soft and the spicy mayo was a great compliment to the salmon. The salad was also very good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be coming back here.The decor is nice, but the food is very good.

My sons first words were mmmm it's good!  He had the chicken I had he Chana and we split the rest. It was way too much food! But all was very tasty. Not oily like some Indian takeout can be. The Chana, biryani and samosas were listed as vegan. Meaning no ghee or milk.  It was ready in about 20 minutes from placing the order in yelp, and was flavorful and fresh. The Chana was ordered spicy, and it was flavorful, but not hot. The samosas were crispy. Not greasy. The garlic naan was not overpowering. A good addition but not necessary, since the Chana and hockey came with an ample side of basmati rice. The biryanis was good, but honestly we had too much food for me to do more than just taste it. 

Soccer or not, this place was good."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My favorite local restaurant,I always have a good meal here. My friends and I had dinner at the Cantina last night to celebrate my birthday,  We had a table of 11 people and as always the service was great. For the table we ordered the chips with sampler and chip with salsa. The guacamole was really good and the queso had great flavor. The black bean dip was ok, nothing stood out about it.

A couple of us ordered the duck tacos and duck quesadillas, As always they were delicious, great flavor. A friend ordered the mahi sandwhich with mango, she said it was very good. Everyone's meal was delicious. 

If you go there and you are a duck fan, definitely get there duck torta or duck taco, they both sooo good. 

About half way into dinner a band started playing they were really good but it was a just little too loud. They were good but we couldn't hear each other. SO if you want to have a conversation you should probably sit in the courtyard.


Don't forget duck torta or duck taco, you won't be disappointed."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food at Dadeo's is unique and the fritters are great. I really like that they have Cherry Coke and their Ribs fall right off the bone. 

The reason that I chose to give Dadeo's a 2 is because of an experience I had a few weeks ago. I phoned in at about 10:30 on a Monday to ask if I needed a reservation for lunch on Wednesday. The man who answered the phone was unpleasant telling me to phone back in 30 min when someone was there who could take the reservation, and he hung up on me. I called back later in the day to ask about a reservation and the girl started to write one up for me and then I was put on hold. When the phone was picked up again I was informed that Dadeo's is not open on Wednesday's, and I was very disappointed. Not only did this leave me without a lunch reservation for a birthday lunch (I should have started planning earlier) but based on previous customer service at this place, I would have a hard time going back."

The beans were good but not great. The chorizo was ok. I will probably go back and try the rice. It was great. We had a great experience here. We were on a short walk down the street and were able to get in without a reservation. The food was great and the service was great. We ordered the lunch special and it was DELICIOUS. The only thing we did not like was the sauce on the fish, but the sauce made it taste like it was made for a fish. Also the fries were the best part of the meal. They were very good, and the sauce was very sweet."

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Went here for dinner Wednesday night and it was just mediocre.  The host seemed bothered that I didn't know how many guests were in the party and she mentioned how she would have to walk over to her iPad to see the reservation as if it were an inconvenience.  When we didn't receive straws for the drinks, we asked the server and she brought them over and said  ""sorry, we are out of big straws"".  I glanced at the bar and could obviously see two different sized wrapped straws.  There was a miscommunication on my wife's pizza and she did correct it by having them make a new pizza right away.  However, they made her new pizza and brought it out, along with the other pizzas for the table before mine.  Most people were almost done eating before mine ever got to the table.  Overall, the food was decent, but it felt like we were an inconvenience to the staff by being there.  I see no reason to go back when there's plenty of other options in the area."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I hardly could say that the sushi here was as good as in some other places I have had visited in Tampa Bay Area. I used to have lunch and dinner in both locations of the restaurant in New Tampa and Dale Mabry Avenue so that it is fair to say the restaurant should improve the quality of the food a lot if they have ever wanted to boost the business. Otherwise, it would not be my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Tampa. The nigiri, for example, had too much rice while the fish cut was thin and cheap. The fish like salmon or white tuna were not very fresh also. As for regular pieces of fish, they were all pale in color - the salmon, if it was fresh, should be deep pink/orange, but rather a light orange. The hibachi steak was pretty chewy and harsh. Sometimes, the sushi rice was dried and bland as I could not taste any sour flavor of vinegar as the sushi rice was supposed to be. Thus, I would pay few dollars extra to have a better AYCE sushi experience elsewhere."

First visit and the two items I had were great!  This spot is located between a gas station and My Brothers Bar. Sits on the same side of Jeff Hwy near Robear's Snowballs.

Service:  walked in and was immediately greeted. Counter service for ordering and they will bring you food to your table. Small spot, which is perfect for having great BBQ.

Food/BBQ:  I ordered the Jayhawk sandwich. It's half brisket half pulled pork. They offer 4 or 4 sauces for BBQ. I got two sauces, Pineapple Bourbon and Hickory. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was very good. I was tempted to put a fork full on my sandwich, but the meat was pulled high falling off the bun already. The brisket and pork did. It need any sauce, it's that good!!!  I enjoyed the sweet and savory using the Pineapple Bourbon. I mixed both sauces near the end of my sandwich and thought it created more flavor. Next time I'm in town, I will be back to get more BBQ here!!!  Great place!"

The lettuce was not fresh. I would not recommend this place. I've been coming here for about a year now and I've been disappointed by the service and quality of the food. I've had great experiences with the food and it's always good. It's very pricey for what it is, but it's not bad. I've been here twice now and both times the food has been really good. The first time it was really good. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's definitely good. I also like their french fries and they are really good. I also like their sweet potato fries.

We waited about an hour to get in, and we ordered:
Bonuts
Eat Nasty 
Egg Plate with over easy eggs and bacon 
Dirty Chai latte with non dairy milk 

My husband's family is southern and having visited the south quite a bit, I've had a lot of Southern biscuits. The problem with Biscuit Loves plain biscuits is that they don't have that crust or crumble that makes biscuits so good, nor were they salty enough. You gotta have that salt and crumble to balance the smooth butter and sweet jam. 

The Bonuts were the best thing and I'm not that much of a donut fan. And the Eat Nasty was delish...that biscuit was different than the plain ones and was better. The Dirty Chai latte was good, but the one I got at Pinewood Social the day before was definitely better.

Overall I have to believe there's another southern biscuit maker somewhere in Nashville with no line and better biscuits. If you find them, please let us know."

I mean whoever idea it was to put it on garlic bread, I want to personally thank you because YUM! The grilled chicken Caesar omg I have rarely come across a place where they do it right, they actually exceed my expectations. I have not been through their whole menu but I have been through enough to order a often enough to highly recommend as a great overall option for a step above the basics. The food is delicious, the portions are huge, they are friendly and have your food together in a reasonable amount of time even on busy nights."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I came here after walking out of Dickys. Which is fairly close. 

I came here because of the positive Yelp reviews. Plus he place offered a free appetizer for checking in (fish balls).

The check in for the free appetizer has a countdown clock, set at 4:00. The center came by after a five minute wait.  I ordered the fish balls and the red pork plate ($10.95) along with a side of brown rice ($1.99). 

The appetizer came about 10 minutes later. Absolutely delicious. The fish is tender and the dipping sauce has a hint of a bite. 4 fish balls won't fill you not they will have got ready for the main course. 

My main dish arrived as I was eating the first fish ball. The red pork is delicious. It came with a delicate filling sauce and a fairly generous serving of bok choi.

The rice side was quite generous,  about two cups worth of rice. However,  the rice itself was rather bland. The dipping sauce helped. 

I was a bit hungry when I finished, despite the generous portion of rice. But I will be back."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Please read carefully why I asked for the receipt and why I chose to write it down. 

I am very disappointed. The food and service is very good. The atmosphere is nice. The staff is very nice. I will not be returning. This is my first time at this location.I love this place!  I love the atmosphere and the food is so good.  I live in Philly and I love the atmosphere and the food.  It's very affordable for what you get.  I'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner, but I'm looking forward to it!Good food, great service, and good prices. I love the chicken and steak tacos. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Tucson.I was looking for a new spot for pizza and this place did not disappoint. I got the tomato pie and my wife got the white pizza. Both were delicious. The pizza was very fresh and"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I was wanting a delicious, tasty, and filling burger but after reading the reviews I was pretty disappointed.  The burgers were the most disappointing part of the meal.  The burger was so dry and had no flavor.  I would have liked to have had more meat.  The fries were a bit too salty.  Overall, I had a good experience at a great burger place.We had a great experience here.  We were on a short walk down the street and were able to get in without a reservation.  The food was great and the service was great.  We ordered the lunch special and it was DELICIOUS.  The only thing we did not like was the sauce on the salad, but the rest of the menu was delicious.  

The only thing we would say is that the menu is a bit limited.  The regular menu is on the smaller side, but we did enjoy the lunch special"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I rarely write a bad review, but this one is pretty awful.

The food is absolutely terrible. The burrito I got was very dry, and the cheese was cold. The chicken was extremely tough and tasteless. The beans were cold. The rice was very bland. And the salsa tasted as if it was made with lime. The chicken was barely warm. I also ordered a taco salad, and it was cold and tasteless. I don't even like Mexican food, so I couldn't even eat the salad. I felt bad for the people who are just here to eat.

If you like Mexican food, you probably won't like this place.This was our first time here and we're so glad we went. I got the California roll, it was delicious. I also got the shrimp tempura roll, which was great. My husband got the fish and chips, and he said he liked his fish and chips"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Took my husband here for his birthday dinner. Maybe it was how late we arrived, around 8pm, but the place was empty. We were fine with that and sat around the rotary. We tried a few plates, not super impressed, and the same stuff cycling around and around. None of it looking that exciting, just plain rolls. We finally decided to order a specialty roll. It was better, but we were definitely underwhelmed. Especially for the price. We've been to other ""by-the-plate"" rotary type digs in the valley that were awesome, this was super spendy for not that impressive sushi. The staff was nice enough, but when we asked if they would make any new items for the rotary we were told to order full rolls. Kinda defeats the purpose of the rotary if you ask me. We like to try different stuff. If we wanted to order $13 rolls, we  could have gone to several other of our favorite places that have much better sushi. Won't likely go again. Oh, and the rotary itself is not chilled. Who knows how long those rolls were there before we arrived."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Woof New Jersey. We were visiting a friend in Haddonfield and we decided to all order in from Oriental Pearl. Mind you, my expectations were already a bit low and somehow this place manages to still disappoint. 

In terms of delivery, it was swift and easy, which we appreciated. Admittedly we ordered a lot of items:

- Veggie Lo Mein
- Veggie Moo Shoo
- Sesame Chicken
- Fried Rice
- Cold Noodles
- Spicy Tuna Sushi
- Tuna Shashimi 

All the portions were enormous and I was a bit thrown off my the cheap prices (versus NYC). My biggest qualm was that when we went to pick up the items, we were informed that there was ""no space on the stove top to cook the tuna"". We were a bit confused as to why ""cooking"" and ""sashimi"" would be in the same sentence but we decided to let it fly. It was just frustrating to find this out when we got to the restaurant as this was someone's meal. After calling back home and putting in a new order, we were all set. I honestly just thought they were a bit disorganized about the whole situation."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Went here for lunch as a party of eight and  ended a party  of  7. Waited over  40 minutes  for our  food to  come out and then two  in our party  their chinese food  was not ready. We had to ask two other  servers to  find out where the  food  was and   finally one of our guests left a s she had to be in a  class  so had  no lunch. To add insult to injury they  faced us  with an  18 percent gratuity charge  for terrible  service. They never even  checked to see if the food was acceptable. 

The  food is nothing out of the ordinary and  we d definitely won't be going back here again! we all left there  complaining and it just felt on deaf ears  and not even an attempt to  say  sorry or let me get a manager  for you. all they  are interested in is being  a cash  cow."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My wife and I drove from New Jersey to try this place out. We were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the unique and creative food.  The salad bar was a great mix of fresh ingredients and well executed.  The staff was very friendly and informative.  We ordered the house made boudin balls with a side of red potatoes and crab cakes.  The crab cakes were delicious and my wife had the ribeye with ham and lobster.  Both were well made and very tasty.  We will be back for sure.  I highly recommend this place.  I highly recommend this place.  Will definitely be back.We stopped in for dinner. We were a party of four and were seated at a table by the kitchen. The menu was diverse and I was excited to see that they had a vegetarian option. However, the waiter was not attentive. The food was not what I expected. I ordered a side of broccoli and a salad"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I love the color of the meat and the crunch. I also love that they have a full bar. If you want to get your food to go, you can't go wrong with the burger. I usually get the pulled pork sandwich, which is also very good. If you have a party of 2 or more, the servers will make sure you have a seat at the bar. They have live music on Sundays and they have a good selection of beers. It's very fun to have a conversation with your server. The burgers are good, too. I haven't had anything bad to say about their food. I like that they have a variety of options. I would recommend coming here if you are in the area.I went to the restaurant for the first time and I had a great time.  The service was good, the food was good, and the restaurant was clean and modern.  The menu was pretty extensive and I thought the prices"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"BLAND, BLAND, and more BLAND!

Ordered the sweet and sour soup. It came with broccoli, yellow rice, and a scoop of the best tasting sour soup I have ever had. It was very tasty and it came with a scoop of sweet potato fries. The soup was very rich and flavorful. The sweet and sour soup was also very tasty and refreshing. 

I would definitely come back here again for my next trip to New Orleans.We were on a road trip and needed a quick lunch before we headed to the airport. The menu has a variety of options for vegetarians and gluten-free. 

We were seated quickly at the bar. Our waitress was very attentive. 

The food was tasty. I had the veal and I had the lamb. 

The lamb was tender and flavorful. The veal was cooked perfectly. The lamb was well seasoned and cooked perfectly."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"COVID REVIEW!

I have been golfing at the golf course and having a couple beers after the round for many years and it had always been fine.

Now they clearly do not give a damn about public health. They have the mask required to enter signs at the doors but NONE of the employees wear masks. I mentioned that it is the law and they said I didn't have to wear a mask if I didn't feel like it? Sorry but that is bull pucky. It is a small town and I am aware that the owners are Trumpers and they must not really give a damn if we ever get past this pandemic. If you do not want to go to a restaurant the is not following the public laws stay away from this place. On the other hand if you are a ""Let's go Brandon"" kinda person, you will feel right at home.

I will contact Public Health Dept. but I suspect there are a lot of places like this these days. I hope they are able to do something about it but not holding my breath (just wearing a good mask)."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"this place is so unassuming from outside. if i hadn't been with someone who knew where they were going i would have walked right past it.  It took me a moment to notice the little pods playing anime on the outside of the building and i was already excited.  i walked into the building and as soon as i crossed the threshold i felt like i was in a completely different space. this place is awesome.  it's colors are amazing, i love the decor.  Although i didn't get pod experience this time because we didn't have enough people i still got to taste some colors.  Red is definitely one of my favorites.  the food was out of this world.  the spring roll appetizers were amazing, the sushi was worth the price and the desert was out of this world.  i have to go back just for the pod experience.  hell i would go with 4 strangers to have it again~! a restaurant everyone needs to try before they die.  maybe i'm just partial to any high class restaurant that shows anime"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This isn't my first time at Hooters but it certainly has been a while. I went after my night class and was starving by the time I got there. We ordered some appetizers and sat around contemplating what sauces we wanted for our wings. Our waitress barely smiled the whole time we were there. She maybe smirked and answered our questions in a monotone way. 

The wings were so unsatisfying to me. They crew wanted the breaded wings and I felt it was more bread than chicken in there. The sauces were bland and almost started tasting the same. I'm not a person who can eat spicy things but the spicy sauces were very tolerable.

The loaded fries tasted like any other fries if they were to be loaded. I stopped eating before everyone else did because I didn't enjoy my meal. Our meal came out to be around 80+ from what I can remember. Not worth my money but it was dinner with friends. This has been the only Hooters I've been to on multiple occasions so I don't know if I'd want to venture to any parts of it elsewhere."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"What a wonderful treat during a pandemic. 

We were also treated to a full bar (great music, great food, great service, great atmosphere, and great wine selections). 

The only thing I wish they would change is the service. I ordered the churros and they were very good. 

I'll be back to try the appetizers.We had a great experience here.  Food was great, service was great, and the service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive.  I had the gyro, which was very good and the hummus was excellent.  The place is small and not as big as it used to be.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  The menu is diverse and I would recommend it.  I wish they had more options for entrees.  My husband had the chicken salad and it was very good.  The hummus was very good. "

There was a server who was very friendly and the food was pretty good.I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to try something new since I heard great things about it. I was not disappointed. The restaurant was clean and the service was very friendly. The food was amazing. I ordered the fried chicken, shrimp, and grits. They were all very good. The grits were definitely different than what I usually get at my other restaurants.

The poached eggs were not on the menu. I ordered the fried chicken and I was extremely"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We had a very good time. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We had to ask multiple times for water and then the server never came to check on us. The only reason we were not 4 stars was because the server was very nice.Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this was by far the best. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the fresh mozzarella sticks were perfect. Would definitely come back to try other dishes.I've been here twice, first for lunch, and second for dinner.  The food is always good.  The burgers are always tasty.  The service is always good.  The environment is a bit loud.  The tables are always dirty.  I have been here 3 times, and the food has never been as good as it was in the past.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.Very nice place."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My boyfriend and I found ourselves at Fork, with two friends (another couple), after I'd mixed up our reservation dates at another restaurant. We're so glad that I did! Fork was the right place, at the right time.

We opted for the chef's seasonal menu, and it was well worth every penny. We were presented with about ten courses - each offering a different blend of fresh flavors, from candied dandelion to venison tartar. A few crowd favorites  were the apple salad, kennett square, brown butter noodles, and the raw bar. However, make no mistake - every course gave us something wonderful to savor.

Fork has a unique drink menu, as it is categorized by liquor and flavor. We tried two delightful creations from the citrus-based section that were absolute pleasers! They were so delicious that we actually ordered a couple of each!

The service was fantastic as well. Our servers were knowledgeable, attentive and polite. I truly appreciate Fork accommodating our party with an impromptu reservation on a busy Saturday night!

We will certainly return once the seasons change, so that we can enjoy another wonderful menu, by Chefs Eli Kulp and Sam Kincaid!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"As others have said, the Rathskeller is an institution. The Rathskeller is housed in the oldest building in Indianapolis. The old, historic hall adjacent to the main bar gives you the feeling that there were people sitting there having beers in that same spot 100 years ago. The dining room has quotes from Faust on the walls. Its a cool place and full of character. Dinner is a bit expensive for what you get but the wurst platter is good and jagerschnitzel is decent. I believe the sausages they serve are from Claus's, which are delicious. The mustard is also quite good. The real appeal to this place is the biergarten. This is an authentic, legitimate beer garden which seriously looks like something straight out of Munich. The have a pretty good selection of German beer. The polkaboys concerts are fun, as is the St. Patty's day celebration but the crowds are so intense that I almost prefer tamer nights in the beer garden. Grab yourself a large Optimater, find a place to sit and listen to the music."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Was on a quest for an excellent burger and this place popped up, and boy did it delight. Specials going on for the Cards game, and the place was starting to come alive with baseball fans.
The zucchini chips were the first item to catch my eye, and they were SUPERB! Served in a crispy batter with warmed marinara sauce, the slices weren't slimy or anything, and positively amazing! Definitely ordering again. They had quite a selection for burgers, but the Swiss and Mushroom burger was the  chosen one for this afternoon. Served with bacon, i opted to include grilled onions as well, and it was just amazing. There isn't anything quite like a well grilled burger, only ate half of it (eating the other half as i'm at home writing this review!) and the fries are also seasoned to perfection. A sprinkle of salt and pepper, just a hint of flavor and don't leave your fingers all greasy.
They had other items on the menu, but the burger was simply amazing, service was quick and friendly (even as my kid threw fries and bites of burger around), we will definitely go back."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Well, just hopped, on the weekend. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We were looking forward to eating at the bar but had to wait 30 minutes for our food. We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed. I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the salmon salad. Both were very good and our server was very nice. The atmosphere is great and the food is very tasty. It is a very unique place and we will be back to try other menu items. I was looking for a new spot for pizza and this place did not disappoint. I got the tomato pie and my husband got the white pizza. Both were delicious and we will be back soon."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Went here after a long weekend of work. We decided to try a new place for dinner and we were so impressed. The food was delicious and the service was great. The only thing that we didn't like was that the wait was extremely long. This was our first time coming here and we felt like we were being rushed. We will definitely be back!Great food, great service. I had the salmon with pork belly and it was delicious. I will definitely be back for sure. The only downside is that the food was very bland and it was not hot. I'm from California and have eaten at many different Mexican restaurants in the area. I was in town visiting family and decided to take my wife here. We went in to eat. We were seated immediately and we were given menus. We ordered the spicy margaritas and the spicy chicken tacos. The margaritas were very good and we had a very good time."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My buddy and I ordered a bunch of appetizers and we all left happy. I ordered the fried chicken and it was delicious. The fries were crispy and seasoned just right. I had the seafood gumbo and it was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I had the crab cake appetizer and it was so good. I wish I would have gotten the shrimp and grits. It was all a good experience and I would come back again. Best service I've had in a long time. We went on a Friday night and we were seated quickly. The food was delicious. I had the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend had the bacon cheeseburger. The service was also excellent. The atmosphere is also very nice. It feels like a home away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. We have been to this restaurant several times."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I don't really know what the other people are talking about when they say this place isn't great, which is heartbreaking because I wish they've had the experiances I've had. I feel that this place is far better than Mikado. Their service, the decor (mind the boxes, as this place is new), and the food is all outstanding. I've never left unhappy. The waitresses are always polite, prompt and pleasant, althought sometimes you do have to repeat yourself due to language barriers (definitely not the end of the world), but at least theyre trying :) We've been there several times, and each time gets better and better. Last night a group of us went and we were given a whole sushi roll 'on-the-house'! That never happens unless the server screws up on your meal, which definitely didn't happen here. Also, they're blazing Unagi roll is superb. Honestly, before you judge this place by the reviews you've read on the net, give this place a try. It's cheap enough, and two people can eat for under $30, and be right stuffed. And then maybe you can catch a movie at the Garneau after."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"At first I was in love with Koreana, I thought it was super delicious and some of the tastiest food around. However, after eating at other Korean restaurants and going back to Koreana I realize some of the dishes are a little bland. The portions are pretty large though so I cannot say I have ever left feeling hungry at all. It is usually pretty busy and a few times while waiting for my food I was concerned I wasn't going to have a seat to enjoy my meal. If you're walking to Koreana it's no problem but driving can sometimes be a hassle. The parking lot is pretty tight and sometimes if you're unlucky there won't be a spot for you in it. As for the staff, everyone is nice and they do a good job taking orders quickly and serving the food relatively fast. They have bubble tea and some other deserts which are awesome after a spicy meal and on top of that they have some great Korean snacks. If you're looking for some quick and decent Korean food in the University City area you should definitely stop on by."

Since moving to NOLA two years ago I have really missed this type of food, but I was lucky enough to find Dian Xin a little while ago to get my fix!  The food here is delicious. There Xiao Long Boa rivaled some I had in LA. The Crawfish and Crabmeat Boa was a fun New Orleans twist on dumplings. They were yummy and was a fun fusion of traditional NOLA and authentic Chinese. The entrees and stir fry noodles were so good too. I would highly recommend everything I tried and already can't wait to go again. They also have a beer/wine selection with saki and plum wine additions. The staff was friendly and I thoroughly enjoy my trip here.  The restaurant is smaller in size, especially with reduced capacity limitations, but I joined the Yelp wait list prior to arriving and waited about five minutes. Good COVID precautions.  Clean, well kept restrooms. Street parking. Also offers take out if you would prefer to get it to go."

I am also happy to say that they have a full bar and also have a full dining area with a full bar area. If you are in the area, I recommend the New Orleans shrimp pasta and the spicy garlic shrimp pasta. The food is great and I would highly recommend it. If you like seafood, you will love the seafood gumbo!   The pasta is delicious and the shrimp pasta is to die for. I also recommend the fried green tomatoes and the shrimp pasta.

The food is consistently good, and the service is good too. I wish I could give it two stars. I don't know how I can rate them, but I do think they deserve a second star. We just went there with our group of 4 for brunch. I thought the food was delicious. The service was friendly, fast, and quick. I had the Eggs Benedict with homemade coffee and it was delicious. The portions were generous, and the food was delicious. They have a nice selection of sandwiches and salads. The waitress was attentive and helpful. It was a nice surprise to see how well the food was prepared. I would definitely recommend this place for a good brunch. We've been coming to this place for years. I was excited to try it."

The only downside is that it is hard to get a table, especially if you have a large party. Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this is by far the best. The salmon with the macaroni and cheese is one of the best I have ever had. I had the lobster mac and cheese. You really can't go wrong with the mac and cheese. I had the pork chop with the potato salad. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and was cooked perfectly. The potato salad was also very good. The Mac and cheese was a good portion and was a great portion. The potatoes were very good and the mac and cheese was very good. I would come back here again. I went there for lunch."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We ordered 2 small calzones on a Sunday night around 7pm. The online order said that it would be about 20 minutes. We arrived around 7:10pm and there wasn't a soul in the place, other than the two servers sitting at a table, the cashier girl and the kitchen staff. The total for 2 small calzones was 21 something, each is $9.99. I ordered the deluxe calzone which consists of Mozarella cheese with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. Phillip ordered the greek calzone which is Mozzarella cheese with spinach, feta cheese, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes and banana peppers.

We took our order to go. The small calzones are 10 inches in size and come with a cup of marinara sauce. The marinara sauce is pretty runny, not my favorite. I liked my calzone, but I was a little surprised that it had pineapple pieces in it. I like pineapple, but if I didn't, I would've been a little annoyed. The flavor was pretty good. I tried the Greek one and the spinach in it had a canned spinach taste which I'm not a huge fan of. Overall I liked my calzone, but I didn't love it."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My first meal out since the stay at home mandate was lifted! 

Baba ganoush - Flavor was lacking. Def could have used some spice or something to take it up a notch. I love eggplant so this is usually my go to dip at a Mediterranean restaurant. 

All entrees come with hummus and side salad. The hummus is just okay. They put some type of sour oil on it. All the plates are pretty large portions as well. Nice to share if you want multiple things. 

Half/half plate - I did chicken and beef. Flavorful. The chicken was a little dry, but the beef was fatty.

Gyro plate - super moist and flavorful. My fav out of all the dishes I tried. But, not the best I've ever had. 

Combination kabob - all the meats are seasoned well, but they are so over cooked. The meats were hard and dry. Had to ask for extra tzatziki to drown it in to be able to swallow it down. 

I don't think they make their own pita. It was dry and not warm. 

According to other reviewers, this place used to be popping. Don't know what happened."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I now know the downside of having a pizza parlor make pies for display purposes.  If you are unfortunate enough to come in for a late pizza slice lunch, you end up eating old pizza from the display, rather than anything remotely fresh.  

I learned this lesson the hard way a few days ago, when I stopped in after 2:30 for a small repast to tide me over until dinner.  My Tomato Pie was sauce without cheese (In my world it is sauce over cheese). It was okay, but basically too acidic from sitting around for many hours.  Too, the plain slice while large, had an overworked crust that proved tough and chewy rather than crisp as a cracker.  Time had not been kind to it.

I liked the gentleman who prepared my slices in the oven and brought them to the table, and it was not his responsibility to make a new pie for me.  Still, there outta be a rule that says display pizzas are dumped after being out in the open for more than 2 or 3 hours, so they are not reheated beyond human tolerances."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"While the reviews are certainly true, I thought it would be a nice place to have dinner and drink. The drinks were decent, but the food was not great. I had the seafood gumbo and it was bland and not very flavorful. I also had the short ribs with no flavor. I also had the fried oyster appetizer and it was so bland I could not eat it. I would not go back. I will try again, but will not order the food again. The service was good, but the food was not great. We had a couple of drinks and the waiter was very nice but he forgot my order. I would give this place another try. The place is very nice and the service was excellent.

I had the steak and eggs and it was a little overcooked. I just didn't care for it. I'm not sure what all the fuss was about. Overall it was a pretty good experience, but I would probably stick with the cheesesteak.I'm a huge fan of the sushi, and this place is probably the best in Tucson.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here on 2/14/16 and this place did no impress me. There was an hour wait, which was not bad due to the fact that it was Valentines Day. The most busiest day of the year for most restaurants. We gave them our phone number and they called us whenever our table was ready. 

We did the all you can eat sushi for 29.95 which is only available at the sushi bar. High top chairs with very little room to move. The service was good, and the chef was very friendly. He tried his best to accommodate us. However, I felt super bad because he was attending to three couples. You really could only order one roll at a time because he would be so backed up to assist his other patrons. 

The rolls were very basic. Everything taste pretty much the same. The baked mussels was a good appetizer, and I'm glad we could get it since it was placed under the sashimi section. The thing that sucked the most was that for 29.95 you could only order rolls. And for an additional $20 you could get nigiri or sashimi pieces. Total rip off."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Since Geno's and Pat's were right next to each other, my friends and I decided to try them both. We first went to Geno's and got a cheesesteak with provolone, and then went to Pat's and got the cheesesteak with cheese whiz. I guess if we were really doing to do a taste test contest, we should have gotten the same things on both- oh well.
In any case, Pat's was by far the better of the two. The meat was more flavorful than Geno's and the bread was soft and delicious. The peppers that they had on the side were the perfect accompaniment for the sandwich.  Their fries were also pretty tasty. 
I also thought the workers seemed nicer than Geno's.  The Geno's workers just plain scared me.  And although the workers at Pat's didn't seem all that friendly either, no one yelled at me when I fumbled with my cash (oops, I didn't have my money ready in advance... but I didn't expect a spontaneous fry order). 
Overall, as far as cheesesteak places go, I give Pat's a 4 star because it's the best of the 3 places I've been too."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"When I first walked into this establishment, we were offered a small room but looking around it was not necessary, nobody was here and our party of 5 sat comfortably in a booth. Right from the the start, it was evident that the lady who seated us also served us and also prepared our food for us. She was the one woman show. Our food arrived a couple dishes at a time, not the greatest Japanese food but for a small mom&pop shop, it was passable. We ordered assorted and the prawn tempera which was fried fresh and tasted good. We ordered chicken teriyaki which the chicken breast was abit dry and the sauce was burnt. We also ordered the Sashimi deluxe boat which included salmon, tuna, mackerel, octopus, surf clam and another fish. For the price of the boat, I expected a better selection. The one woman show who has limited English vocabulary brought us the bill when we haven't really finished eating. The lady is a very nice but would I come back here? No I wouldn't. There are other Japanese restaurants in Edmonton that are better in food quality for the price."

The food is always great and the staff is so kind and accommodating. I love their house salad, but I've never had any of their pasta dishes. I'm a huge fan of their pasta dishes and their pasta dishes are always great. It's a fun place to sit and have dinner, but I've never felt rushed or overwhelmed.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place used to be good. I believe there are new owners. It is horrible now!!! I think the new owners inherited the previous owners Yelp reviews. I went for lunch and I was the only customer there the entire time. When I arrived the waiter was on his cell speakerphone and just showed me my seat without an offer of drink or chips. He continued his conversation for about 5 minutes in the dining room then returned to the front and talked to another waiter. I walked out front and asked if I could order. He said I'll be there in a minute (yeah really). That was my signal to leave but I didn't have time to go anywhere else. I said I'm on my lunch hour. He still took his time and took my order including drink order (still no chips). Food came, still no drink. I ordered the fajitas and everything was thrown on the plate. Presentation was sloppy. Not like original in the past. There are too many restaurants that appreciate your business for me to ever return there. I had been going there for years for lunch and dinner."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,You will never find another place as awesome as this.  This is a huge food market.  There are people from all cultures and backgrounds here making food and selling goods.  It doesn't matter what you want to eat you will find it here and it will be amazing.  There were foods and cultures from places all over the world.  Not only the food but there are so many people from different cultures from the area that come here to eat.  It's truly a really awesome place to be.  There is paid street parking and there always seems to be a spot because people are constantly coming and going.  I went to a creole place and had an alligator po boy with creole mustard.  So tasty and sweet you wouldn't even know you were eating alligator unless you were told.  I also had some alligator gumbo which was a bit spicy but it was so awesome there.  I would suggest people go here or even the market in general and eat at all of the little places because each one was more interesting then the next.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Boyfriend and I have made it our summer mission to try every sandwich on the menu. So far, here's our best to worst:

1. BRISKET
Ridiculously tender, delicious au jus. Extremely flavorful - the best we've had. Probably the heaviest sandwich on the menu (as in, ""oh my god we have to wait like an hour before we try to bike home"" heavy.)

2. ROAST PORK
Everyone knows about the roast pork sandwich. It's DiNic's staple, and for good reason. This is a bit lighter than the brisket, and slightly less flavorful. As other Yelpers have recommended, I'd throw some toppings on it to liven it up a little (I like the roasted long hots and horseradish myself.)

3. PULLED PORK
This sandwich is the reason I'm docking a star. Not sure if we just got the bottom of the barrel when we ordered, or what - but the sandwich was flavorless, and OVERWHELMINGLY fatty. Just big, bulbous blobs of fat with a few shreds of lean meat throughout - it tasted more like lukewarm meat jello on a roll. My stomach was seriously unsettled for the rest of the night as a result. Ick. I'll stick to the brisket and pork."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,I stayed in this hotel for an hour and a half and it was packed. I was pretty hungry so I went inside and I got a seat right away. There was a lot of people waiting to get in and out of the room. There was a bar area to sit and have drinks and a few tables to eat and it was a pretty big place. I ordered the pork chops and I was quite surprised to see that they were not on the menu. It's very dry and not the most tender I've ever had. The sauce was very bland and it was not seasoned well. My friend got the pork chop and said it was decent but he wasn't impressed. We ordered the Italian beef and lamb and we both enjoyed our meals. The service was very good and our waitress was nice. I wouldn't say the food was great but I'm sure it will be good next time. I really enjoyed the cheesesteak and my wife and I enjoyed the salads.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is probably one of the best restaurants in the city.  The food is amazing and the staff is so friendly.  I will definitely be back!I have to say I was very disappointed. I ordered the salmon and I am extremely disappointed. I was charged for two slices of salmon and a salad. I was charged for one slice of salad and one slice of salmon. I will not be returning.Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch, but the decor is absolutely gorgeous. We sat at the bar and had a great conversation. We ordered a couple of different things from the menu. I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the bacon was crispy and the waffles were delicious. I highly recommend going here. You will not be disappointed.I really enjoyed the food here! The service was great and the atmosphere was very welcoming."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Earls is always a solid choice for a good dinner. I always love that they have a full bar. If you want a nice, solid dinner, the Treme Bar is definitely the place to go. 

The staff is always friendly and the service is excellent. The food is always fresh and tasty. I've been here several times and the food is always delicious. I will say that the service has been consistently good and the food is always hot and delicious. I'm not a big fan of their desserts, but I will say that they are always delicious. I usually get their chocolate cake and it is definitely a hit or miss. I usually get the chocolate chip pancakes, but I've never been to a place that does that. I've never had a problem with the service, but it can be hard to get in and out of the restaurant. I think the best thing about this place is that they have a very nice staff that is always friendly."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The first time I walked into the shop I was struck by the revelation that this is unique but extremely well done marriage of concepts.

And it works. Well. 

If anyone less genuinely pleasant, less enthusiastic, less INTO everything that is a coffee shop and record store tried to do this, it would be an utter failure. 

But Adam's priorities are in exactly the right place. The coffee and the atmosphere. It is the fact that this is by far the best coffee shop in Fishtown that keeps people coming. His focus on great coffee, excellent baked goods, a smile that makes it worth it to just walk in. The fact the the walls are lined by some seriously well selected vinyl just makes it better. No wading through crap to get to the good stuff. The good stuff is right there. On the wall.

A good cup of coffee and a croissant served by arguably the happiest dude in Fishtown is enough to make me keep coming to Milk Crate. The likelihood that I will walk out with coffee AND a near mint condition Al Green record just makes me... well.... feel things... glorious things... in places I..."

I'll tell you straight up, Mesa Pizza Co is one of the restaurant reasons I am sad not to live in SB anymore, I love their pizza that much! Every time I go home, I always take 2 large pizzas to carry out, one with pepperoni & one with pepperoni, sausage, green peppers & onions. 

The crust is perfect, crispy, and thicker than many hand tossed, but not a thick doughy crust by any means. The sauce is great, the perfect mix of sweet, savory, and seasonings. I wish that I could eat this pizza right now! OMG! I want my own large pizza! Yes, it will take me 2 days to finish a large, but I always get a large, always, because this pizza heats up great, even in a microwave!

I'm already looking forward to my next SB trip & enjoying Mesa Pizza Co's delicious pizza!

The sandwiches are nothing like I remembered. This time they were almost empty. We ordered the Reuben and the New Yorker, both made with corned beef and pastrami. I think the entire sandwich consisted of three slices of bread and two slices of meat. It was a joke! 

When it comes to beer they usually have a nice selection, but on this night I couldn't get an IPA on draft. I made two different selections and both were out so I decided to order wine, but the wine was very sweet. We waited more than an hour for a table and it was definitely not worth it. Between the long wait for a table, the lack of beer, and the poor sandwiches, it was a bad night.

The curry egg rolls were very good but the chicken biryani was bland and the curry egg rolls lacked flavor. I ordered the chai tea and it was very watered down and flavorless. The biryani was so bland it made me want to buy another one. I am not sure if they have a good selection of spices but it is very expensive for what you get. I will definitely be back.Great place!

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My favorite thing about this restaurant, besides the obvious (great atmosphere, interesting and well-executed menu, the fact that it's in nashville...) is how happy the vibe is, starting with the people who work there. Everyone, from the floor managers to the servers to the cooks are visibly having a good time being there. The positive vibes are palpable. That not only creates an authentically amazing experience for guests, but it comes through in the food, too. Everything was great! 
We had a group of 6 girls for brunch. 2 are gluten free, 1 is vegetarian. We appreciated how over-the-top the restaurant is about gluten free offerings. We had several questions, and could tell by how careful the restaurant was about labeling, that our two GF diners were in the BEST of hands. 
We ordered a smorgasboard of selections, from the biscuit entree to the  shakshuka to the chilaquiles. Everything was very good. Oh! And the bloody mary's! yumm!
Beyond the food... which was good... was that every detail was special and taken care of. Even the coffee mugs they serve coffee in were creative!
Can't wait to get back to Nasahville, and will 100% visit Butcher & Bee again!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Let me preface by saying I used to work with some good friends who are from India that would bring their food everyday, so I've tasted the real stuff. This place is just as good! We wanted to try it and of course the good reviews helped us decide so we placed a DoorDash order. Everything was amazing. We got the chicken Tikka Masala (an easy choice since it's common) with some garlic naan and I also got the vanilla shake that had some fruit mixed in but I can't remember the name. The tikka portion was quite large - enough to feed both of us dinner and then I still had a little left for lunch the next day. The taste was perfect and not too spicy. The naan was to die for. This place really cares about the quality of their food and it shows. Cant wait to try other things!

P.S. if you are worried about unpleasant trips to the bathroom because of the exotic spices... lol I'm about as Caucasian as it gets and it didn't hurt my stomach at all. In fact it felt like I had just had a comforting home cooked meal."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Finally got to try this cute spot this past weekend and it did not disappoint. For starters, there is a limited menu of three options of ramen. I ordered the Geki-Kara (half spicy) and this was by far some of the best ramen I've ever had. It was obvious the pork was marinated for hours and the base of the soup itself was full of flavor and amazing seasonings. Each ingredient in the ramen was fresh and carefully placed so they blended perfectly together to make a delicious soup. Next, the service was incredible! Our waiter walked us through the menu and offered different tips for what he thought we'd like and even recommended drinks that would complement the ramen we ordered! His attention to detail definitely did not go unnoticed. All of the staff was super sweet and they were so thankful for our business. Based on the customer service alone, this place deserves 5 stars. Finally, the inside of the restaurant is small, but intimate and has stunning art. You can tell each piece is intentional to the mood they're setting. It was an all-around, pleasant experience and I highly recommend anyone to try out Nomiya!"

But let me tell you- the food was amazing! Everything is made from scratch and delicious! Wish there was a better choice of on tap beer and not just the domestics, but that would be my only suggestion. For appetizers we got the baked Brie in puff pastry and the French onion soup- holy cow.
Entrees included the fish and chips (duh) and the roast beef dinner with house-made Yorkshire pudding! Both dinners were excellent, plenty of food and HOT and FRESH. The BEST fish and chips we've ever had- the batter was so light and fluffy and not greasy at all. For dessert we splurged on bread pudding and the chef's seasonal specialty, a pear poached for several days in Cabernet Sauvignon, vanilla and spices- served with house-made whipped cream and oatmeal digestive biscuit. Damn. 
We even got to meet chef Peter, who was just as friendly and welcoming as the food he made for us. This is a great little place and we will definitely be back!!"

I couldn't understand this since my previous visit was wonderful, with delicious sushi served pleasantly in a sparkling clean restaurant.

I am so glad I did. The restaurant and service were just as pleasing as I remembered them, plus our server was quick and attentive.

We were a bit tired off the same burger and chicken stops our travels had taken us. We found this spot via Yelp app and a few others. Parking three ambulances was not an easy task here and only option was a paid lot across from the restaurant. When we walked in we had to wait for a few minutes for them to get a table ready for us.

The employee was rude. The chicken crunch wrap I ordered had a black kissing bug in it. I calmly called the establishment and the employee was rude. Eventually I received my money back, but I'm sure this happens very often since the manager didn't even bother to show her face and sent the food prep employee to handle the horrible transaction. At the same time the employee' s friend jumped in and started yelling at me ( stating I was mean) when in all honesty I really wasn't. I never yelled, called names-- I just made a comment how next time when a customer brings back a contaminated meal you should probably just apologize for the inconvenience. I asked ( again ) if the employee was the manager and the first time she said yes, then the second time she declined and finally called out her manager. Sadly, I'm never going back here again. I love Taco Bell in general, but now I will try to avoid it especially this location. I'm also sending in a report to the health department, because I'm sure this must be a common issue."

My boyfriend, a local thought it would be adorable to take my low tolerance to Bourbon Street and shoe me some of the delights of the city. After corralling me for two hours this situation became a little more than anyone could handle so his brother decided I needed some greasy food in my system. Needless to say this review will be vague because it is a bit fuzzy. The atmosphere was great with a jukebox and very nice people. Our bartender was very patient as I attempted to order the entire menu before settling on a cheeseburger, onion rings, and cheesy fries, I was sharing- don't judge!  The burger was like heaven at that moment. It was thick and juicy- and calmed me down nicely after a long day of New Orleans. The number one compliment I can give this location is the next morning I was not sick. I woke up and only felt dirty from the lack of shower.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,The food was delicious. The server was nice and attentive. I will definitely come back!Very good. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked to perfection and the chorizo was flavorful. The burrito was big and had a nice amount of meat. I also got the vegetarian option which is a great option for vegetarians. They have a great menu with lots of different items to choose from. I will definitely be back!We had a party of 6 and the service was absolutely horrible. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table and we were told that they didn't have any specials. We were told that they had some specials and we could order from the menu.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Since I'm living in West Philly I never thought I would ever consider making the effort to hop on the trolley for another Ethiopian Restaurant. after all I'm living in Philly's mecca of Ethiopian food! But I stopped in Almaz to give their Hot Chocolate a try, and I might just be tempted to become a turncoat. 

I made note of it's inexpensive food options, and it's superior coffee varieties. And If I didn't stop in for brunch at a spot earlier I would have definitely stuck around longer to try them out. But the service here was unbelievable. the people who worked there really had a lasting knowledge of who a lot of their customers were (Soon I will be among them). and made a point to keep anyone satisfied even if they were 
just stopping in for a cup of coffee on the go. The hot chocolate was amazing. It might just be the best I've had in Philly (need to hit up Cafe Pier One again just to double check).

so to recap amazing service, inexpensive Ethiopian food, and incredible coffee options. throw in the free Wi-Fi, and sweet looking balcony spot that they have going and I'm sold!"
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"first time ever I wanted to open the can of negative stars. 
first off: you actually have to pay to get into the casino. not a bad scam...we'll keep over 90% of all money and charge $10.00 a person for the privilege of doing it!
of course, this is mentioned NO PLACE.  you find this out when you try to enter the casino floor and are greeted by the ""security team"" at the turnstiles. note to casino ""security"": not everyone is out to rip off the place. your the first representative the customer encounters. if you act like an ass, for no reason other than ""you can"", the customer (that would be me) won't be back for more free anal retentive lessons.
anyway, I stand in line, get the card, pay the ten bucks for the privilege of being able to spend more money...get  past the security find a machine, and the damn card didn't work. flipped it over, tried different machines...nothing.
back to the damn line.
new card.
back to machines.
card works.
it only took 45 minutes from when I walked in until my first play.

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Went here to carb-load before a race.  Left full of carbs, but otherwise disappointed.  

When you walk in, it has a dinery feel, which I liked.  Felt very down to earth.  Apart from that, my immediate impression was that it had a very strange and overall displeasing odor.  I'm not sure what it was, but it stayed the whole time and I didn't like it.  

We ordered the calamari and fried mozzarella to start.  The mozzarella was pretty good, but boring, and the calamari was bland and disappointing.  I got the Chicken Parmesan.  People are right, the servings are big - but I'd rather have it be small and tasty than large and blah.  But that's what they gave me.  Giant chunk of chicken, a very small portion of spaghetti, ironically.  I got bored eating it.  

We did order dessert and that was pretty tasty - a cannoli and a tartufo.  Both were quite good - maybe 4 stars on the dessert.  

Finally, the woman serving us was generally unfriendly.  Everything we asked for seemed like an inconvenience.  I won't be coming back here."

I would highly recommend the fried chicken, as it is one of my favorite dishes. We ordered the lunch special, and it was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the truffle fries which were cooked perfectly and cooked just right.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I attended a Colt's tailgate party catered by Ruth's Chris.  I was excited to go because I heard good things about the restaurant. 

It was some of the worst buffet food I've had.  The field greens salad was ok, but you can't really screw that up since it comes in a package. 

Next they had creamed spinach which tasted like it was not made from scratch, but came out of one of those big food pouches you cut open to heat and eat. 

Then there were the bland, dry duchess potatoes.  They really needed salt and seasoning, yet none was provided. 

However, the worst part of the meal was the one thing Ruth's Chris is known for...meat.  It was the sorriest looking buffet dish of meat I've ever seen.  The meat looked like ribeyes that were cooked to death (past well done) then left in a chafing dish with broth.   They were grey and unappetizing.  Everyone seemed to complain about the food. 

After Ruth's Chris catering experience, I will never step foot in their restaurant and pay those ungodly prices for a good steak. 

I can cook filet perfectly myself at home every time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"In my neck of the woods a sudden yearning for  take out sushi used to result in a stop at the grocery store for an uninspired version of the delicacy.  Then I saw Yoshi Cafe, nestled next to a chinese place and a dry cleaner.  When my latest craving hit, I took a chance.  Walking in, I  discovered a bland and austere interior, but thank goodness I didn't let atmosphere be the final word.

 The sushi itself was very good and, at times, absolutely delicious.   The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fish fresh, the tempura crunchy but not greasy. I don't go for a lot of the heavily sauced sushi, so this review is limited to the basic masago/ unagi/ spicy tuna variety sushi which were all delicious and traditionally prepared.  I did step outside the box and order their Outback roll with grilled beef and scallions.  It  was delightfully tasty and I would order it again, especially for those in my world who don't do sashimi.

 They are a tad on the pricey side, but it's a price I gladly pay for fresh, tasty sushi.  I'll be back."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The cozy El Salvadoreño Restaurant and Pupuseria is really excellent.  It's worth driving home from the shore on the White Horse Pike just to stop here.  Of course when eating in a Salvadoran restaurant, one's first thoughts are always of pupusas.  Happily they are very tasty here - I have enjoyed both the cheese alone and pork and cheese filled pupusas.  And the homemade curtido served in a large plastic tub is totally the bomb. The pink cabbage Curtido is always used to top the pupusas. Their Yuca Frita - another well-known dish from El Salvador -is also excellent and tasty chicharrons accompany it nicely. Meals start out with delicious and light nacho-style chips served with a cream bean dipping sauce.  Every table has bottles of the famous Guatamalan Picamas Salsa Brava to give any dish a little kick.

The prices are incredibly low for the quantity and quality of the food.  And you can eat in or take out. 

El Salvador is certainly the most interesting cuisine from Central America with its Spanish and native influences and El Salvadoreño is the best example of it in the Delaware Valley.  And of course they serve pupusas!"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Located right across from Acme, this is the best burger I've ever had. I usually order the burger medium rare, and I am not a huge fan of the bun. I love that it's a little smaller than a burger, and it's not bun-like. The fries are always a hit. I also always get the chicken teriyaki roll, which is made with chicken breast, tomato, lettuce, and cucumber. I like that they have a ton of options for your taste, and the price is a little high for what you get. I usually end up with about $10. 50 for the roll, which is not bad, but I think it's worth it. The place has a lot of fun and fun to hang out with friends. It's also a little loud, but I don't mind that. There are a few TVs on the floor that you can watch the game, and a few tables that are set up as a bar."

The hostess was very nice and told us we would have to wait about 15 minutes.  We ordered our drinks and were given our food at the same time.  

I ordered the crab cake po boy and my husband had the pork chop po boy.  Both were excellent.  The shrimp was very good.  My po boy was good but the shrimp was very small.  I think the breading was a little too salty for my liking.  The breading could have used a bit more salt.  My husband got the gator bites and he said they were delicious.  I had the crab cake and he said the gator bites were the best he had.  We had a small party of 7 and the wait was only about 15 minutes.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"As someone who loves ramen and has eaten at many places in LA, San Diego, the bay area, and lived in Japan 4 for months this ramen is gross. When you first eat it, the flavor isn't bad. However, the broth is so greasy and fatty, unlike traditional ramen at all. In order for them to get their strong pork flavored broth it feels like they just throw in as much pork fat as they can, instead of letting the broth marinate for hours to cleanly get the flavor. Their meat is really thick and comes in a large portion which people might like, but it overwhelms the dish and has too much fat on it. 
Also, despite not hating it in the moment, every time I go home I feel horrible and lethargic as if I just ate a whole fast food meal and need to take a nap. To make it worse, my friend brought her left overs home and it SOLIDIFIED IN THE FRIDGE. That's how much fat is in the broth, DISGUSTING. If you have never had ramen before, you will probably like this place. As someone who is very picky, this place is a definite no from me."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"In a normal scenario, I would've been thrilled that Branzino did not have a seat at the front of the house as I had asked during my reservation (forget the window, the entire room was packed)  The backroom with the muraled walls and chandeliers was straight out of a history book. 

Now for the but...Our table for two turned into three with a pillar literally at table-side and on my face.  Apparently our waitress forgot but we were shameless with a direct ""can we get some bread, please.""  We couldn't order appetizers ahead of the entrees. (""sorry, but the kitchen is busy."" seriously) For a table slightly larger than our napkin, you get the picture. Our dessert menu came in with, you guessed it, the entree orders. 

The food was really the saving grace with great flavors and semi generous portions. (My grilled squid was delicious; we also got the gnocchi and the snapper special. I don't think our tiramisu serving dish needed much cleaning as we wiped it clean) And for a BYO, Branzino accepts credit cards. 

Seems to be a common theme with Philly Italian places (amazing food, crappy service) Next time I'm going back to La Viola."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My husband and I took my 5 year old daughter here for an ice cream (she wanted pink ice cream w/ sprinkles). The girl taking our order was absolutely rude and had an awful attitude towards my daughter. I ordered her cherry jubilee ice cream and my daughter asked her if she could have sprinkles also, she proceeded to roll her eyes at my child. After handing me the ice cream, I asked for a milkshake which she gave me a smirk like yes I get that making a milkshake takes a little more time then scooping ice cream into a cone or cup but its her job and what I wanted. She told me that it'll take some time for the ice cream to defrost and that I'd have to wait so I said that was fine and sat down while my husband and daughter enjoyed their ice creams. Finally when it was done she yelled here and put it on the counter and walked away towards the register.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I have visited 3 out of 12 locally operated Kahwa locations - a solid choice especially if your veins bleed and scream coffee like mine do! Plus, it's obviously better than Starbucks!

I recommend:
1.) Iced Aloha Latte: 5/5
2.) Iced Lavender Vanilla Latte: 4.5/5
3.) Iced Latte + peach simple syrup: 4/5

I got a large Iced Latte with an extra shot of espresso & addition of peach simple syrup (I've grown to like the sprinkle of peach syrup - they are so good at all locations about not saturating their lattes in sugar, so the flavor of the coffee doesn't get masked and is still there!).

I sat outside momentarily where they have a couple umbrellas and helped there was also shade from a nearby tree. I was so glad to be sipping on something cold while making my way to Dr. BBQ because I was freakin' burning up due to hot temps! 

I downloaded Kahwa app where I've spent over $45. I got a $3 credit when I signed up, but fyi - everytime I use the app, it charges me a % of the total bill, which I def. do not like - kind of the defeats purpose of a loyalty program, don't you think? lol"

He put his chunky fingers in the bag and out comes a savory, crunchy, juicy cracklin....and he fed it to me....what a tease....I wanted more of it!  I knew I was going to be in a for a treat.  It was a table of about 12 of us...and Jacques-Imos spoiled us all that night.  Their house salad is this awesome spinach salad with a worcestershire vinaigrette.  They top each salad with a fat and crispy fried oyster....so good....and so different that salad.  Everything on the menu is good.

We put down our name, for a group of 5 at 11:30am, the wait was an hour and a half. So we came back at 1pm and for seating within 5 minutes. 

I had done my yelp research so I knew what I was ordering! I got the Crème Brûlée French Toast, and shared the Chicken and Waffles Benedict with my husband. Both dishes were GREAT! The chicken + waffles is what you'd expect, and the egg was great on top. Chicken was fresh and juicy and the waffle was soft and warm. So good. But the really winner was the French Toast! Our whole table tried it and walked out wishing they had ordered it. It's pretty sweet but the tartness from some of the fruit is a nice balance. Portion size is big, definitely couldn't have finished on my own.. 

I'd definitely go back and try their other French toast plates!"

I called to cancel my reservation at 9 AM, as early as possible today and finally reached someone at 10:20 am after several calls. The hostess politely said there should be no problem canceling since this was an unavoidable emergency but the manager said we had to pay $140 to cancel and showed no compassion for our situation. He even said they had a high demand for reservations! This was his reason charging us $140, because he had held that spot for us. I guess he was saying they didn't expect many customers and needed to make as much money as possible tonight. Considering the reviews I would be surprised if business was so bad!

Very cider-y with lots of warm flavors. We may have enjoyed it a bit too much given the state we were all in upon leaving the restaurant. I ordered the Spanakopita appetizer for lunch. It was light and flaky and the spinach filling was really tasty. My only complaint is that I wish it had been slightly crispier. Another friend ordered the dolmeh appetizer and was also very pleased. The sauce was rich and had good flavor. The flavor wasn't quite what one would normally expect in dolmeh, but was still very pleasant. The chef even included a cabbage roll for some variety. Our third friend had a shrimp and tomato dish with feta cheese baked on top. It was brought out still sizzling in a cast iron skillet. The cheese was addictively salty and the shrimp were full of flavor. Lunch included complimentary baklava, which was oozing with honey and deliciousness. Overall we were very pleased.

[Crabcake Breakfast] 
The crabcake was delish! It was tasted really fresh and didn't come drowning in sauce like alot of places do. I love the fact that the crabcake didn't rely on the sauce to give it flavor. It did it all on its own. The crabcake breakfast also came with sides. The biscuit was huge and fluffy! the grits was extra creamy!

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We met for a family birthday.  I was pleasantly surprised by the renovations when we walked in, truly updated.  We were a larger party and most were seated when we arrived.  I provided our last name and got a clueless stare and was asked if I was sure that was the name and was asked several other last names.  I then gave all the first names- still nothing.  No offer to look and see if we saw them- we ultimately texted a family member to please come get us as they were so unhelpful.

Out waitress was subpar at best.  In our group were 2 vegans, one with significant diet restriction.  A special menu provided including gluten free options- and an eggless pasta dish with vegetables- perfect we thought!  When the food arrived they had substituted another pasta- when questioned she said that's the only gluten free.  But it contains eggs- the dish was refused.  They should have checked prior to substitute.  The drinks were slow, the alcoholic drinks twice as slow. The other meals overall were delicious.

 Not certain we will return to this location, the service needs updated with new look to be successful."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We drove an hour & twenty minutes up from Pinellas county to meet friends here.  Against my judgement (** rating) we made the trip.

The structure itself is beautiful, & the ambiance is interesting & appealing.  The food & service needs to improve.  Both were just meh.

Three of us had the Potato Pancakes smothered w/ Beef Stew.  None of us finished our entrees, & only one of us asked for a take-home box.

If only my meal had been dished as pictured on-line, i.e. with half of the pancakes dry.  As it was they were lost under the sauce & tasteless.  The stew itself was decent.  The beef cubes were tender but uniformly dry on the surface like they had been plated well in advance of pick-up.

I even asked my waitress if I'd be happier ordering the ""Hunter Stew"" & ""Potato Pancakes"" appetizers, separately.  I was told ""NO"" (BAD TIP).  My wife's Pork Tenderloin was reasonably tender but on the dry side w/ perhaps three miniscule bits of mushroom in her Mushroom Gravy.

No soups or side salads, $22.00 for my stew & soggy pancakes, $19.50 for my wife's Pork.  Nothing (postive) memorable, of value, coupled w/ ordinary service."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've been here on two different occasions with friends. It's a very interested homage to diners, including the one that most recently housed this location, and to craft foods and drinks. I feel like this is a place where a hipster crowd feels very at home. Prices tend to run around $8 and up for appetizers and drinks. A happy hour might be a good bet- I made it here most recently and had a Hemingway/Paris inspired drink that was a cross between champagne and absinthe. Not my usual cup of tea but I was curious. I also enjoyed a fantastic hurricane which was loaded in booze. On an empty stomach, I was floating on that and some more drink from my friend who didn't finish. 
Our appetizers were a sweet potato dish with some candy- I forgot what it was, but the plate was kind of skimpy and we paid like $9 for it. But it was tasty. The plate of pork nachos was amazing.
My previous visit I ate a fried chicken burger between two biscuits, hamburger style. I think the menu here changes a lot as I recall. It's fun- I'd go back, but happy hour is more my style on my tight budget."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Buddy's is probably my favorite brunch place in the area. I always love the ambiance and the staff is always friendly. The food is always good and the portions are huge. I especially like the egg and cheese omelette which is always filled with delicious and filling ingredients. The staff is always extremely friendly and they have the most convenient location in the area. I highly recommend this place.We live in the area and love the atmosphere and the food. We always go here for lunch and it is always great. The service is great too.We went for our first time here. We ordered the lunch special and it was DELICIOUS. I ordered the truffle fries which was cooked perfectly and cooked just right. The other meals we ordered were excellent. My husband had the veggie pizza and it was incredible. My husband really enjoyed his sandwich as well. The service was excellent. We will be back again soon!What a great surprise! We were in Nashville for a week and stumbled across this place and had

I think this place is a good place for a quick bite to eat.Great experience, great atmosphere, good food, great service! 

We were seated right away, and the waitress was very attentive. I had a chicken dish, and my husband had a steak dish. We both loved our dishes! We ordered the following:

- tots
- bacon mac n cheese
- caramelized onion rings
- crispy fries
- spicy chicken

All were delicious and our waitress was very attentive. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!I've been to this restaurant many times. I always have a great time. They have a great happy"

It was a little pricey for what it is and I would recommend coming for the food. I was also impressed with the place and the atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back here again. Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch, but the menu had a variety of options for people who are just getting started with brunch. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits which were delicious and the French toast was fantastic. I would recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat. This is a great place to eat. It's very clean and the staff is super friendly. We had the Salmon, the Scallops, the Salmon Burger and the Seafood Brie. Everything was delicious and the service was great."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Instagram worthy and Claire is an amazing server! 

Suraya is super beautiful guys. Nice open space, ceramic tiles, and orange infused water. You enter straight into their bakery/cafe where you can order and sit or you can walk past a little and be seated in their restaurant. I recommend making a reservation because it can get pretty crowded. After a 10 min wait my party of 4 were seated straight away. Their booths are super comfy and bouncy! 

Claire came to us shortly after and was super knowledgeable about the menu and helped us navigate for one of our party members who has an allergy. I started with the chai tea latte- so delicious. Then got a kefta platter. Once the food came out I realized it was the kefta sandwich but Claire and the manager figured everything out straight away and fixed my order (thanks guys!). The kefta was super moist, the hummus was A1 and their fries were seasoned to the max. Though I think their tabouli could have more lemon- just my preference though. Afterwards I finished with a rose and pistachio cruller which was so light and airy. Y'all gotta try it. 

If visiting philly again I would definitely come back to Suraya."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The cashier was rude and on her personal cell phone half the time we were trying to order, she kept interrupting us when we were trying to tell her what we wanted. We got to go food and we got 3 different dips and only received Half a bag of chips. When we asked the cashier for an extra bag of chips, she said it would be a $1 even though we ordered 3 different dips and chip refills are free while dinning in. When we got home, food was wrong... we ordered chips and queso with beef and had NO beef in it, even though we paid for it!!!! And my tacos had no tomatoes on it even though I asked for extra tomatoes. Our pager died, and when we went to walk up to let someone know, the same cashier slammed the food on the table and walked away. We've tried calling the restaurant 4 different times and it keeps going to voicemail, no one is answering the phone....

We are unaware of the cashier's name and the receipt said ""cashier 1.""  She was wearing a red shirt with longer shorts and had her hair up in a bun. We came on 1/30/2021 at 6:20pm."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I had high expectations walking into this restaurant. From the classy décor, upbeat music and incredibly friendly and welcoming staff I was ready to be impressed.

I ordered an in-house brewed root beer (middle of a work day though an alcoholic beverage was tempting). It wasn't bad but not the best I've ever had. Next was a standard house salad. By far my biggest disappointment. The lettuce was obviously from a bag and most of the leaves were browning around the edges. I ordered it with a bland blue cheese dressing.

For my entree I was looking forward to a delicious sounding lobster and shrimp mac and cheese. I asked the server if it was good he said yes but very rich. I ordered it fully expecting a creamy and rich cheese on it. It was mediocre. I expect more flavor from New Orleans cuisine and this place didn't deliver. The only redeeming quality was the shrimp. Cooked perfectly!!! 

If you need somewhere to eat a quick lunch or dinner and fund this place convenient I would try it... Otherwise I would recommend going to a different restaurant for more flavorful food. I feel for the quality of this food I was grossly overcharged. 

The service was awesome though."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I became attached to Cafe Du Monde after a friend recommended it.

The food is good.  The drinks are good, but the food is not great.  I had the seafood platter and it was good, but nothing special.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good.  I also had the crab cakes and they were good, but nothing special.  I guess I'm used to the experience of eating at a good restaurant, but this was definitely not the case.

Overall, I would definitely come back, but I wouldn't necessarily expect it to be a good experience.

They have some great specials, but I'll be going for dinner and dinner, not to mention for dessert.I was looking for a new spot for pizza and this place did not disappoint.

It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it.  I'd come back just to try it out.I ordered a pizza for delivery and it was awesome. It had all the ingredients I needed to make a pizza with a perfect crust and flavor.  I had the dough and the sauce.  I loved it.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.Good food, great service. Had the mushroom soup, which was delicious and was cooked perfectly. The waitress was attentive and helpful. It was a nice surprise to see how well the food was prepared. Would definitely go back.This place was good. The service was good, and the food was good. I was expecting more of a relaxed atmosphere.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Caffe Caffe is a very nice place to go if you're in the mood for a chill, casual atmosphere. The drinks are also a must try, the food is delicious, and the service is excellent. The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent. The staff also works hard to accommodate your needs and keep you satisfied. The food is always delicious and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I highly recommend this place!I have been here twice and both times I was very disappointed with the service. I ordered a gyro, which is supposed to be gyro meat but it is mostly meat. The meat was not as flavorful as I had hoped. I did have the fish, which was delicious. The service was also poor. I had to ask for water and water glasses several times. I hope this place stays open. I would definitely return. I really enjoyed the food here! The service was great and the atmosphere was very welcoming. The service was very friendly and attentive."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"i'll touch on the high and the very few low points:
-great service, all staff is friendly, hostesses could be a little more outgoing, seemed like they were just board.
-parking sucks...this restaurant is in a large mall. there is some valet parking. otherwise, be prepared to walk a bit.
-make sure you have a reservation. we went on a thursday night and this place was packed. we made out reservation on their website
-food is fantastic. i wish they offered more steaks choices other than just filet mignon, which i typically am not a fan of, but i ordered the surf & turf any way, upgrading to a larger cut of meat for an extra $5. it was one of the best filet mignons i have every eaten, like butter, perfectly extra rare and so flavorful....i usually like steaks with a bit of fat on them, like strip or ribeye, but this steak was fan-freakin-tastic!!!
-i think their dessert choices are lame.....they're just a collection of shot glasses filled with various styles of dessert. yeah, i get it, you may be full from dinner, but maybe i want something larger than just a shot glass of pie or cake.
-overall, a great restaurant, especially for a chain, which i usually try to avoid........"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My critique mirrors so many of the others I've read.  The concept is is a good one, while the execution is a disappointment.  

There is clearly a lot of money behind this venture.  The structure itself is a clever design, creating discrete areas (a bar area, two formal dining areas, a lounge area with couches and coffee tables, a coffee bar, even bowling lanes) underneath one open and magnificent superstructure.  Everything is anchored by an enormous copper square bar at the center if it all.  The design is clean, inviting, and somehow intimate despite its size.  If you appreciate craft coffee, there is a beautiful marble Crema coffee bar toward the entrance.

Despite the impressive building, the food struggles to live up to the expectations created by the environment.  I dined at lunch, ordered the tongue reuben with cauliflower salad for $13, and was sorely disappointed by both items.  Ordinarily I'd write this place off as all looks, no substance.  However, having read other reviews and having seen the cocktail menu, I'd be willing to return and give the bar a chance.  So much potential for this place, but upon my first impression, it's remains to be only potential."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Ashamed to say that I've lived here forever and frequented downtown Indy and the food scene, but never been to Mesh! Devour Indy week hit, and it was time to make it happen! First of all, I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Classy, chill, with an upscale feel, but not so stuffy that you feel like you're out of place in normal clothes. The devour menu included 3 courses for $35. The lobster bisque was absolutely amazing, definitely one of the best I've had. I chose filet for my entree and it was cooked exactly like I ordered, great flavor, and very tender. Dessert was a chocolate luxury, so rich and decadent, definitely a calorie splurge but worth it! Dinner was worth a five star review, I only removed a star for service. Our server seemed very preoccupied with the tables around us, at one point we waited over 30 minutes for her to return while we watched her visit others multiple times. She was short and acted as though we weren't as important as the others. It was disappointing, as the staff that greeted us at the front was awesome and friendly and set a much different tone. I'd still recommend Mesh, as the food was insanely good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"So my husband decided to go with the Ribeye. It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of the Chicken, which is what I was expecting. The sauce was nice and creamy and the meat was good, but nothing special. My husband got the Roasted Duck with Roasted Red Beans and Rice and it was good but not amazing. I think the bread was a little dry for my liking. I think it was just too salty for me. I think if they had a little more salt on the menu, I'd definitely get it again. 

I'm glad we found this place, because it was a nice find. I'm not a big fan of the other places in the area, but I'm glad I tried them. I would recommend it for a casual lunch or dinner.The decor is nice, but the food is very good. I had the BBQ shrimp which was really good. I thought the meat was a little under cooked but that's how it was cooked. I would give it another"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Was in Metairie today and saw a great deal on a Togo deal for a small order of fries. I had the Chicken Bacon Burger and my wife had the Bacon Burger. We both enjoyed both burgers. The Bacon Burger was a little sweet and cheesy. The Bacon Burger had a nice sweet taste to it. The fries were good and I think they were the best I've ever had. I was happy to see they had all the toppings for the burger. I would definitely order the burgers again. I'm not sure what the hype was about this place, but it's definitely a good place to try if you're looking for a quick, healthy meal. I'm a huge fan of this place and I've never been disappointed. I have been coming here for a while now and I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great! I highly recommend this place. Best Thai food in Tampa. We went during the lunch rush."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken.  However, I was pretty impressed with the quality of the chicken, and the sauce that was offered.  I would definitely go back.  It was good enough to keep me coming back.  I ordered the blackened chicken, which was very good, and I'm pretty sure the white sauce was the same.  I was quite surprised with the portion size of the chicken, because it was pretty large for the price.  I would definitely order the blackened chicken again, since I was quite hungry.

Overall, it was a good meal, and I'd probably come back.  It's a bit pricey, but I'm sure I'll get it again.  I'll definitely come back again and again.Went here for the first time recently and was very happy with my experience. I was on a late night run and was greeted by a friendly server. I ordered a sampler of 5 of their small plates and the order was ready"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday.  Apparently, unless you have a large group, you can't be seated around one of the cool outdoor tables with the fire pit in the middle.  So we were fortunately able to enjoy the fire (which is actually slightly dangerous... especially when you order wine and/or try to share entrees).  We shared the appetizer platter among 4 or 5 of us, which was both fun and tasty.  The flavors here are standard to any other similar Middle Eastern restaurant - but that is a good thing!  I love the sauces and contrasts between hot/savory and cool/cold/refreshing.

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table, which we later found out when we got the bill, was half off! (every Monday) If we had known this, we might have ordered more wine!  So good to know for an early week out-to-dinner treat.  I shared the lamb skewer/basmati rice dish with a friend, and it was definitely a sufficient amount of food for both of us.

The atmosphere is great, the service was friendly, and the food was satisfying.  A great place to try in Santa Barbara!  Parking can be a little tricky though."

I contact the front desk and the lady working is incredibly rude and non helpful. She tells me the heat pump needs to be worked on and she will send engineering. My wife was undressed and she just attempted to take a shower and we had dinner reservations to make. I called back and said that wouldn't work and we need another room, they reluctantly agreed and I took time to come down and deal with registration all over again. Now we get back from dinner and the new room has no hot water!! We contact the front desk and Kara is extremely rude again and refuses to move rooms for us and says our only option is to sit around at 10:30pm and wait for engineering like that's how we want to spend our time and vacation in Reno.

I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the dessert.  I liked the way the crust was mixed together.  I liked the texture of the crust and the way it was made.  I will say that the bread was not very good.  The bread was very soft and very chewy.  I liked the taste of the bread.  I would definitely go back.  I was a little disappointed by the bread.  It was okay, but I would have liked to get it less sweet.  The waitress was a bit on the slow side, but she was very friendly.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"First, parking is a nightmare.  Go in between lunch and dinner, maybe you'll find a spot to park. Second, no one greeted us when we walked in .  
Looking at the menu I really wanted to try the Baja fish tacos but I'm fussy and was afraid I wouldn't like them so I got a soft chicken taco and a crunchy beef taco with all the fixings.  Made it a meal with rice and beans and Diet Coke.  Hubby got the Baja fish tacos.  My meal was fine, nothing to shout out about but ok. I liked hubbys fish tacos a lot, and will definitely order them if we return.  I'd say my meal was one step above Taco Bell.  
I LOVE what this restaurant looks like inside. Think contemporary meets Tijuana! Concrete floors, crazy colorful murals painted on the walls, plenty of seating, and a good sized sauce bar. It was very clean as well.
Service was great and workers very friendly. Lyla (sp) the girl that waited on us was a real kick. I just wanted to take her home, lol! 
You could go across the street to Taco Bell for less dinero but you wouldnt get the ambiance or fish tacos!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Meh.....
Date night! We  decided to support local establishment rather than drive into STL.

We really wanted to like this place, and really looked forward to trying it out.

Pros: both my wife's filet and my portobello chicken were both very good. And that is about it.

Cons: called and made a reservation for 7pm, when we got there there was no hostess, and the staff was like umm just sit anywhere.  Downstairs decor was nicer but there was a live band so we went upstairs where we thought it would be more intimate.  Wrong choice.  The acoustics upstairs were so loud you could barely hear each other.   Decor upstairs was far from the edgy/modern look some have described here... I've seen nicer McDonalds.

As others have stated the Food took over 40 minutes to come to our table, while good it was just too long, waitress was a little inattentive and barely knew the menu.

After she delivered the bill she disappeared for another twenty minutes before she came back to get our card. 

Tip: At the Seven ""sushi"" restaurant next door you apparently can order from the full menu, and has better decor, if we were to go back we would sit there, but we won't be back."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"If I could give 0 stars I would. My friend and I were looking for someplace to eat and it was between Smashburger and Azian. We decided to pick Azian and we were severely disappointed.  When we walked in there wasn't a hostess so we stood there for a moment until someone came by. As we were about to be taken to our table, the server answered the ringing phone, even though there were plenty of other workers. After we were seated we noticed there was NOTHING on the menu for the BBQ part of the restaurant. 

After about 15 minutes of servers walking by and not even taking a drink order from us (keep in mind there were about 5 tables seated so not busy at all) and all the other people around us being served we decided to leave. As we were leaving the girl who seated us yelled ""Bye, thank you for coming in."" To which I preceded to yell back across the restaurant ""Thank you for not even bothering to serve us!""

We went to Smashburger instead and order and we were served in 5 minutes delicious burgers. Morale of the story? Go to Kimchi Time down the road, authentic Korean food and way better service!!"

I opted to create my own burger, however I'm a vegetarian.  They had a veggie burger option and said it would be no problem to substitute.  I ordered, specifically asking for a veggie burger.  The waitress confirmed this with us and that I wanted a veggie burger with no meat.  My burger came out, while the toppings were correct, it was a beef burger (no biggie, this happens all the time to me), so I sent it back to be made with a veggie burger.  The burger comes out the second time, no burger of any kind just a pile of jalapeño and mushrooms...what?!?!  So I send it back again, the waitress played ""dumb"" saying she didn't understand, but confirmed I wanted a Black Bean Vegetarian Burger, not a beef burger at the time of order.  Despite that, the garlic fries were dynamite awesome! And the veggie burger, when I finally got it, was delicious.

Would've given higher rating if it wasn't for our service."

Austin,the bartender, made my wife one of the best manhattans that she has ever had and also made me an old fashioned that was a step above.  We were so impressed that we returned tonight for a whiskey flight and dinner.  We ordered a charcuterie board for a starter which did not disappoint. It included house made mustard, cured meats and locally sourced cheeses and honey comb.  DELICIOUS!  For dinner we shared a bone in rib eye with tallow butter,collard greens and mashed potato purée. We finished with the flourless chocolate cake.  We have traveled all over the country and Deacons has moved to the top of our list for favorite places to visit.  The best part of this experience was the staff at Deacons.  Austin at the bar made us feel right at home and his suggestions for both food and drinks were spot on. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Nashville. If your are a local consider yourself lucky that this place is in your backyard."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is my favorite in the area. My boyfriend and I meet here for lunch almost every Friday. We usually sit at the bar and Gina is the best bartender/server. She's always super friendly and a blast to talk to. She knows our order and will put it in as soon as we sit down so we can get in and out. We get the Il Bel Lago Burger EVERY time and it is absolutely delicious. Gina is always happy to make adjustments to our order because we have some dietary restrictions. Cannot recommend this enough.
Today we stopped by on a Saturday around 4:30 and realized after we were sat that they didn't even open until 5. The fact that they were more than happy to serve us even though they weren't open yet is just one example of why this place is a must. The waitress we had was more than happy to let us order the burger even though it wasn't on the dinner menu. She let us know it would take a little longer than normal but it ended up coming out in less than 20 minutes which was more than fine. Amazing service, awesome outdoor seating, and AWESOME food.

He said it was ok but I did not think it was worth the price. The bbq chicken was good but the sauce was a little too spicy. My husband thought the ribs were ok but the flavor of the sauce was not very good. I was not impressed with the service. There was a very long wait for our food and there was no other option for us to eat."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"If I could write a better review, I would. I will admit that I have been to the other locations in the area and have had good experiences, but this one is definitely not that. The staff is extremely rude and I am extremely disappointed. This location is still in business for the last two years and I have to say, I can't believe it is still so bad. I have never had a bad experience here. I am not sure what all the hype is about, but it is definitely not my favorite location. I will most definitely be back.Worst service ever. We went here for a birthday party. The wait staff was slow. We waited over 30 minutes for our food. The waitress was a bit on the slow side, but she was very friendly. We didn't get the dessert, but it was delicious! I'm not a fan of regular chocolates, but this one was really good. I will say that the service was very slow. The service was very slow.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"If you are interested in a place that does not try to be anything more than a local restaurant, go to Biscuit Love, you won't regret it. This place is amazing!  The staff is so friendly and the food is absolutely delicious!  The food was brought out quickly and was very tasty!  I had the Beef and Rice and it was so so good. I will definitely be back!I was there for brunch and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  I got the french toast and it was really good!  The French toast is a big portion and it's a little more sweet than some of the other places I have tried. The only thing I would change is I would prefer it to be a bit more sweet and less sweet. My boyfriend got the bacon cheeseburger and it was good but nothing special. I would go back just for the french toast!I've been to this restaurant many times. I always come here on a busy Saturday night. The food is very good."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I was in the area for a day and had to have some Philly food.  This place was a great find!  I was there at lunch time and they had just sat a table of 6 or 8 in front of me.  I thought uh oh, I'll never get served.  No worries though, the server came to me in a short time and got my order.  My drink was served in no time.  I ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a chicken cheese steak.  It was a great lunch.  The pizza was what I expected, philly style.  Nice sauce with a fine tomato flavor and the cheese was melted and stretchy, like Philly pizza ought to be. The chicken cheese was great too!  On a nice Italian roll, fresh veggies and served hot.  It was a great eating day back in my home town.  The server was very nice, especially as busy as she was.  Friendly and smiling and she didn't short me because there was crowd across the dining room.  I even met the owner on my way out.  It's nice to patronize a real family restaurant where the family actually is there running things."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"This place is horrible. I visited his location due to my flight being cancelled. I walked in to place my order no one acknowledged me. A few minutes late a girl come up smacking gum. The biggest piece of gum blowing it in my face. I placed my order  a burger, fries and drink. She couldn't hear I had to keep repeating myself. Ugh. After I placed my order it took 20 minutes to get my food. FYI NO ONE WAS IN THE PARKING LOT or RESTAURANT !! They had all these workers and this one employee is walking around talking loud. ""Imma have to leave because I gotta take my daughter to the hospital. So y'all going have to cover my shift, but I don't know yet"" really?! That type of stuff should be discussed in the back office. A few minutes later this other girl is screaming my name like I'm not the only person in the restaurant. I get my bag and realized it's super light. I wanted 20 minutes for just a burger. It wasn't even hot?! I just walked out, because the hotel shuttle waiting on me. Soooooo. Do not eat here. Don't waste your time. Food not good and the wait definitely isn't worth it."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"My friends and I went here this week because one thought it was ridiculous that I had never eaten here before.  Fortunately I was not disappointed. 

I was skeptical - a Chinese food joint that tries to do other asian cuisines can truly be hit or miss.  That being said, I was warned not to order anything but Chinese food.  Apparently their Thai and Korean dishes aren't good at all.  

I ordered the roast pork egg noodle soup with vegetables.  I was told that this soup is prepared very authentcally and is probably the best thing on the menu.  It was delicious!  For $6 it was loaded with big pieces of pork, lots of egg noodles, and lots of bright green, crisp broccoli rabe.  It felt like I was eating a comforting homemade soup and not something loaded with fat and MSG.  There was so much of it that I could only finish half of it.  Of course, that could be because of the banana and strawberry smoothies I had with it....  

Definitely check out this place, but be wary of what you order. Also, be patient; the service is kind of slow (and hence the 3 stars instead of 4)."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Given the other reviews, I'm not sure why we decided to go back. The food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but the food was good enough to take it back to go. We ordered the salmon, which was very good. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I had the pork chop, which was good but nothing special. I liked the grilled salmon better. I think it was on the salty side, but I think it was just me. My boyfriend's salad was okay, but he was not impressed with the pork chop. We will probably try the shrimp and grits again next time we come. We were a party of four and we were all in a rush. We went in to the counter to order our food and it was already taking a while. My boyfriend got the chicken tenders and said they were pretty good. I got the half chicken tenders and my boyfriend got the half shrimp and grits. The chicken tenders were very good. The sauce was very good."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"*1st time (month or two) and the food was just ok. 

The food was good. 

If you are looking for some good Italian food in a very small town, this is the place to go.I came here for lunch with my family. The staff was great. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. The food was so good. I had the grilled salmon with pork belly. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the pork belly was very juicy and flavorful. My family also had the gyro plate. They were very generous with the portion size and the meat was very tender. The rice was soft and the spicy mayo was a great compliment to the salmon. The salad was also very good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be coming back.We went to this restaurant with our group of 8. We had reservations on a Saturday night. We were seated right away and service was good. My husband ordered a shrimp and grits and my husband had the duck and chicken."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I didn't think I could eat it, but it was good. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the fries. The fries were okay. They were pretty thick, and had no seasoning. I also ordered the gyro meatballs which were also pretty good. They were a bit small, but had a good amount of meat. I'd rather get my gyro meatballs from a place that has a good meatball sandwich, so I can eat them all. Service was friendly, and they had a nice selection of beers on tap. I definitely recommend this place, and I'll be back!I stopped in here for lunch and was immediately impressed by the delicious menu and the service. My sister and I had a great time and enjoyed ourselves. My only complaint is that we were a bit too full for our meal, but that was not a big deal. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great lunch spot."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Coaches is what I'd consider your standard sports bar, minus the TVs. They do have pool tables, dart boards (the dart boards are in a god awful spot though), a few arcade games and a shuffleboard table, so there are activities other than gambling, which is nice. 

Staff is friendly, depending on who is working, but the service can be super slow if you're not a regular. Biggest issue with the staff is they have no idea at all how to make basic drinks outside of 2 ingredient cocktails like a run and coke. Asked for a whiskey sour and got something that was red. Bartender said it was her own version, which isn't what I ordered. I had to explain how to make the drink in order to get a (still very poorly made) whiskey sour.

Food is pretty good, I've never really had anything bad there, but nothing I've had is memorable either. Really no complaints come to mind.

Bar still allows smoking, and the ventilation system is laughable, so if you're a non-smoker, the haze and smell may be a deterrent. It's too bad when 2 or 3 people can hurt the experience for the other 20 there because they way to chain smoke. 

Pros: 
Location
Food
Activities 

Cons: 
Smoke 
Can't make drinks

What a great way to start 2015, one of my top 3 all-time favorite burgers, The Banzai Burger here at RR.
In no particular order, my top 3 burgers are, The Banzai, The Cheesburger Supreme from The Good Steer in Lake Grove, N.Y. and the Cheeseburger served at the Travis Bowling Alley snack bar, Travis AFB, Ca. The Juicy Lucy at Square One is a solid #4 but hasn't cracked the top 3 yet.
Recalling my younger days when the 5 hour flight to Waikiki was a weekend trip for airline employees based on the west coast, slammin down what were called Teriburgers was all we needed. Served at all the beachside snack shops the teriyaki burgers were heavenly with that slice of grilled pineapple in there. I just had one and I want another. Red Robin's Banzai is remarkably close. With it you get endless fries which are of the steak cut variety. This time the fries were a bit undercooked but I didn't care, not when a Banzai is sitting next to them. 
I know it sounds weird, pineapple in a burger but then ham and pineapple pizza is awesome. Tired of that same old burger? Get on over to RR and put down a Banzai, wake up those taste buds. RR, yum."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"First time eating at the Carrolwood locator and it was a nice experience. Wednesday nights there are special shrimp deals and specials so it got pretty busy and our server took a while until he greeted us as well as getting us drinks. But other than that he did well to take care of my date and I. 

We ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp, Scallops & Shrimp skewer, and the Swordfish & pumpkin ravioli special. 

The bang bang was not as spicy as I've had elsewhere but still yummy and well sized. 

My shrimp and scallops were well cooked and prepared. 6 big shrimps and 4 small- medium sized scallops. Quality vs. quantity seems to sum them up. They tasted great with the new line tomato garlic sauce. 

My date got the swordfish and pumpkin ravioli special and she loved it (first time having swordfish and eating at Bonefish)!
I enjoyed it as well. It was topped with a butter shallot sauce and feta cheese and the fish melted in my mouth. The pumpkin ravioli is also not too strong with pumpkin flavor, but rather a nice subtle taste as well as brown sugar. 

Overall good service and excellent food! The decor and ambiance also made the experience one to make me come back."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We rolled into Clearwater in search of a good dinner. I saw a lot of reviews on Yelp. We decided to try it. The place was busy, we got seated quickly and it was pretty quiet. We ordered a couple appetizers (salsa and shrimp) and the shrimp was very good. I got the red fish taco with the rice. It was really good. I got the salmon taco and it was pretty good. The shrimp was a little salty for me but it was still pretty good. The shrimp taco was really good. I got the duck taco and it was pretty good. It was definitely a bit salty for me. The only thing I didn't like was the sauce. It was a bit on the salty side for me. It was good. My husband got the chicken burrito with rice. He said it was pretty good. The chicken was pretty dry, but not too salty. Overall, this is a good place for a quick bite and a quick meal. I would recommend it to anyone."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I went to Boathouse hoping that it would be a good experience. 

The food was good.  The drinks were good, but the food was not great.  I had the seafood gumbo and it was bland and not very flavorful.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good.  I also had the crab cakes and they were nothing special.  I just went there with my friends and we were really disappointed.  We won't be back.  

The service was good.  I would definitely go back, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I have been here many times and have not been disappointed. The food is good and the service is great. However, I have not tried the food yet and I am not sure what they have to offer. My family is vegetarian and we have never had any issues with our food. They always have fresh produce available and I have never had anything that was not fresh. The service is very friendly and the staff is always on top of their game"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I wasn't up for dining here. The food was ok but nothing special. The service was horrible. We waited for over an hour for our food and the manager never came to check on us. The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the lack of staff. We felt bad about leaving because the food was good but we felt bad because the manager didn't take care of us. The manager should have been more attentive but he didn't even bother to check on us. I would not recommend going here.I've been here several times, and I usually have a great time. They have a great selection of beers, and some great specials. I love their location on the beach and the patio area. I've also tried their sandwiches and their seafood platters. All of the food is great, but I've had some of the worst service. I've had a bad experience with the wait staff and management. They are very nice and attentive, but they don't take reservations unless you are in the mood for a date night."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I found this restaurant on Open Table because I wanted somewhere close that I could have a reservation since it was a Friday.   I get there at 7 for a 7pm reservation and our table isn't ready. The host was rude. No apology for us having to wait.  10 minutes later I inquire about an empty table and am gruffly told, ""that's going to be a 4-top.""  After we wait for a couple to finish coffee and watch our table get reset we finally are seated. The rude host still does not apologize but mutters something about ""we shouldn't have been allowed to make a 7pm reservation.""  Hmmm. Blaming the customer for poor front-end management is never going to sit well with me.  In spite of the rudeness the chicken liver appetizer was good. The rest was just OK and in Philadelphia OK isn't good enough for an Italian meal. 

A couple next to us finally gets up to get a glass because no servers would stop at the table. They said they frequent the restaurant and it's the worst service they've ever had. I told them it was my first visit and because of the service would also be my last. This was Friday, Nov. 16, 2018."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"I came to Wendy's do to my VW Passat is at Custom Concepts Tinting. I ordered a Organic Strawberry Passion Fruit drink and French Fries. I waited over 15 min. Now there was a line in the drive thru. Inside where I was there were two customers in front of me. The 15 min was the wait after I ordered. I finally went to counter to get my ""large"" order only to be told they were out of the organic drink I had ordered. It was 11:30a. I decided to go with organic Mango drink after being told the other was out. The French Fries were on the cold side of lukewarm. I had a thought of asking for fresh fries but I didn't know how long it might take. Now I am a patient man. I only writing review after seeing how slow the other orders were. I believe future customers have a right to know about the service. I know employees can have a bad moment or day. I can always let that slide. Service is very important in a large company like Wendy's. Management needs to be reviewed at this location."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I recently went to Emeril's on a saturday to celebrate my wife's birthday. I have to say that the service from start to finish was first class! I have been to world class restuarants all over the world, but I have to say that there is something to be said about Southern hospitality + chef Emeril's standards in his restaurants. We started off the night with the Chili Butter Glazed Lobster Skewers (the creme fraiche, nice touch). We got the syrah by the glass. We usually drink Croze Hermitage/Hermitage, but Emeril's Syrah had a nice clean finish. Tasty wine. We then went into our main entrees. I got the Andouille Crusted Gulf Drum (Fish) and my wife got the Char Grilled Louisiana Beef Ribeye. This was my first taste of drum fish, and it was excellent. The ribeye was one of the best I've had in awhile. Obviously, my wife and I shared our entrees, but the food was superb. To finish it off, although we were full, we just couldn't leave without trying the chef's Banana Cream Pie. First of all, the pie had REAL BANANAS! excellent! We will definitely be back to New Orleans, and we will definitely be back at Emeril's! My compliments to the chef! Thank you for the hospitality!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Pleasantly surprised and impressed by this place. We decided to try a few different things and the staff was so friendly and accommodating. We also ordered the Tuna melt and it was sooo good. It was served in a bed of rice and veggies and it was so flavorful. The only downside was the service was very slow. We had to wait for about 10 minutes for our drinks, but it was worth it!  We will definitely be back!We have been going to this restaurant for years, and have been going to this restaurant ever since. I have never had a bad meal here. The food is always good, and the service is always good. The reason I am giving it 5 stars is because it is not the best food in town, but it is the best food in town. My family is from California and we all love this place. I love the location and the decor. It is very clean and the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."

We waited over an hour for our food and then the manager came to take our order. He came back and said we were out of the food. I was very disappointed. The manager also came to take our order. I did not want to be rude to him but he acted like I was bothering him. I felt bad for him and his manager because I felt like I had been bothering him for quite some time. I will not be going back to this place again. I hope other restaurants are more aware of their customers.This place is amazing. They have a wide selection of sandwiches, salads, and sandwiches to choose from. I went here for the first time and I had a great time.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is a must visit if you are in the area. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. The food is delicious and the drinks are tasty. The only downside is that it is hard to get a table in the drive thru. This is a great place for a quick lunch. The service was great and the food was great! The owner was so sweet and made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be coming back. This is a great place for a quick bite to eat, quick service, and great prices. We had a great time here and we will definitely be back!I love the concept. We were in the mood for some wings and wings to start with. We went here for the wings and I was a little disappointed. I wish they had the wings with the sauce on them. They weren't good at all. The wings were a little dry but I didn't get a good bite of the sauce. The wings were small and just ok. The sauce was very spicy."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here for Father's Day/ Birthday dinner with the family for the first time and honestly the  last time too. I was not impressed by this place. The wait staff seemed all over the place. My sister, who has a year old baby, had to ask our waiter three times for water for the baby. Everyone  at the table got salad except me. I got the minestrone soup. It tasted decent, almost tasted like Spaghetti O's. So maybe that is why I liked it. My sisters baby loved it. When our food came I had the Veal a la Zozo with spaghetti instead of the mashed potatoes. The plate looked like everything was just thrown on. The spaghetti was over cooked and the sauce was very bland. The Veal was chewy and over cooked. But being $23 I didn't just want to waste it. I was 3/4 the way through the Veal when I bit into a hard bone. After that I was done. More then half my food was left on the plate. Not worth taking home. After dinner we all discussed our meals and everyone was unimpressed. Something we all agreed on is the sauces were under seasoned. Giving them a 2 based on the minestrone alone. Will not be back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Amazing!! Tried this gem for breakfast and we loved it! You can always tell good food when the line is long and people are willing to wait outside in cold weather for a seat. Fortunately we only had to wait about 15 min. They are famous for their eggs Benedict and now i know why! They looked so delish, I decided to try 2 different ones: sausage gravy egg Benedict and corned beef hash egg Benedict. Both were so dang flavorful I savored each bite. Their biscuits would be delicious alone as well, which is what my eggs were served on. My friends each tried a fried chicken egg Benedict and fried green tomato egg Benedict...they all cleaned their plates as well. They also tried a creamy vanilla latte, which looked Uber yummy. The waitress explained that they make their own mixture of cream and milk and vanilla to come up with the creamy part. And even though we were all beyond full, we had to have something sweet, so we decided to share white chocolate pancakes. We were all so full, we thought we would each just take a bite, so not to waste food. Those pancakes were so good we devoured them. If you are ever in NOLA make sure your stop here!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came in here at noon during the work week with four other people.  It was packed!  Our waitress took drink and food orders quickly and then....we never saw her again.  The service was AWFUL.  It was my first time here but the people I was with were regulars.  They assured this was the worst service even they had ever experienced so this may be a fluke of a review.  We never received the spring rolls (asked for them when our food was brought out, luckily they gave us a TON, awesome), two people never got their drink orders, and once our drinks were emptied we had to waive down whoever we could to get refills.  It was ridiculous.  Luckily, the food was awesome.  I ordered the lunch special pad thai with chicken.  Only $6.50 and the serving is huge!  I loved it, it was everything I hope for when I go for thai food.  We got the spicy plate to add a little kick to our dishes, yum yum yum.  I so wish our service wasn't so bad.  Hopefully I will get a chance to come back and update my review to a better, because I really did love the food."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I've been here twice now. Both times the food was just ok. The first time I ordered the chicken fried rice. It was overcooked. The second time I ordered the chicken fried rice. It was okay. It was bland. The last time I ordered the chicken fried rice. It was overcooked. The chicken was the most flavorless batter I've ever had. The noodles were dry and just tasted like they were sitting out there for a long time. It's very disappointing. The service is friendly, but I'd rather have a meal out with my family. They just need a little more work on the kitchen.I absolutely love this place. They have a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, and sandwiches to choose from. I went here for the first time last week and it was a great experience! The service was very good and the atmosphere was nice. The bread was delicious! I recommend their potato salad and the chicken sandwich. It's pretty good too. I ordered the Greek salad and it was good. The bread was very soft and the Greek salad"

The only reason we were even in a place to eat is because of the manager. He seemed annoyed that we waited so long to receive our food. The food was good but nothing special.We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed.  I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the salmon salad.  Both were very good and our server was very nice.  

The atmosphere is great and the food is very tasty.  It is a very unique place and we will be back to try other menu items.I was looking for a new spot for a quick bite to eat, but I was not disappointed. My husband and I stopped in for lunch, and we were not disappointed! The service was quick and friendly, and the food was delicious!

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I was only in NOLA for a short weekend and decided to try this place out. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was very dry. The chicken was a little dry but it was well seasoned. The waffles were good. I would come back to try their other items. They also have a good beer selection.I had the crab cake with a side of pastries and my husband had the pork chop with ham and bacon. I don't know if I'm being generous or what, but I'd definitely order again. 

We were not disappointed. We enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. 

I would definitely come back here again.This was our first time here and we're so glad we did. I got the sandwich and it was delicious. My husband got the steak and it was great! I'm a huge fan of the chile relleno and the cheesecake! The service was great and the atmosphere was very laid back. We'll be back soon!So delicious! We got the roasted cauliflower,"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We've been to Meskerem 2 or 3 times, and have ordered the Meskerem combination each time. We went most recently this past Saturday. They brought the combination out quite quickly, but it turned out to be the vegetarian combination. Having them trade it out for the meat combination took a little longer. (I hope they didn't throw out the vegetarian combination, as we literally hadn't touched it. In hindsight I wish we would have kept it, as I am curious about the vegetarian combo now.)

The food was good, although perhaps not quite as good as I remembered. Having the egg with the chicken leg in the middle is interesting. We also ordered the Ethiopian honey wine, which was strong and sweet.

Meal was very satisfying, but then we made the mistake of ordering dessert (only choice: baklava). I never recall being dissatisfied with baklava before. This was a rather large piece of baklava, perhaps to make up for its mediocrity. It also had chocolate sauce drizzled on it, which seemed odd. The texture of the baklava was all wrong, sort of like it was on the soggy side. My wife suggested maybe they took it out of the freezer. I suspect she was right. Taste was disappointing too.

Bottom line, I recommend the combination, but avoid the dessert."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I ate dinner at 5pm. Now it's 1am and I still can't move. =/ If you love bbq and can eat a lot, coming here on a Monday for their all you can eat is worth it. They offer a pretty good selection at the buffet bar including many sides and lots of different meat choices.

Of the sides, my favorites were the mac 'n cheese, corn bread, and the baked beans. They also had macaroni salad, potato salad, coleslaw, collard greens, and mash potatoes. If I really wanted to, eating just the sides alone would've stuffed me!

Of the meats, my favorites were the baby back ribs, beef brisket, and pulled pork. They also had pulled chicken, shrimp, hickory smoked salmon, pork ribs, and some beef tenderolin? All I know is that there were A LOT of meat! 

Now to top off this ultimate comfort food menu, they had pretty good desserts too. Cookies, bread pudding, and ice cream. You really can't go wrong there (unless you ate too much like I did).

I'd definitely recommend checking it out. It's $18.95 + tax and buffet is from 5 - 8:30. They also accept credit cards. Also, on regular days, they do have a full menu of different bbq stuff you can buy by the pound and so fourth."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If I had to choose one thing to eat for every meal for the rest of my life, it would be the easiest decision ever because I would pick Saffron Cafe's mussels hands down, every time, with no other competition. I have literally never tasted anything so delicious in my entire life. The creamy saffron sauce is to die for, and so worth the little bit of yellow stain your fingers may take on (if you're eating them right). Not to mention the warm, fresh French bread served on the side to soak up all goodies. It has a perfectly crusty crust with the softest inside, it's truly God's gift to us left on Earth. The mussels are enough for an entree for one, but what's the fun in that??

There is nothing bad to say about this beautiful hidden gem a little bit north of the heart of downtown Indy. You know it's a well run and close knit business because almost every time I've been there the chef has come out to talk to us, and I've only ever seen one waiter serving there. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy, perfect for splitting a bottle of wine and any of the tajines cooked to perfection, but make sure you get your own order of mussels"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This review is based on the food and drinks.  I will say that the food was pretty good.  The drinks were decent, but the food was not great.  I had the seafood gumbo and it was good, but nothing special.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good.  I also had the crab cakes and they were good, but nothing special.  I guess I should have gotten the crab cakes because it was good, but I don't think I would go back.  The service was okay, but it was not bad either.  I think it would be good if they had a good crowd.This is my favorite breakfast place in town. The food is always good and the service is always excellent. My husband and I have been coming here for years and the food is always good. I have never had a bad meal here. I recommend this place to anyone who loves good breakfast.This is the best Philly cheesesteak ever. The crust is good and the bread is very soft. The staff is so friendly and"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Be very careful when doing this. The food is just ok. The service is pretty slow and the atmosphere is not very pleasant. The food is not worth the money. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I am from San Francisco. This is my first time here and I have to say I was disappointed. I ordered the crab cakes and they were so bland. They were just ok. The fried shrimp was pretty good. The shrimp were a little salty for me but it was still pretty good. The fried rice was really good. I would have liked to have ordered a side of the pork. The rice was okay, but the pork was not very flavorful. The only reason I gave it a 5 star is because of the service. It was not very attentive at all. I wish they would have started with a different waiter for our table. The waitress was pretty rude, but not the best. This is my second time to this restaurant. The first time was a Saturday and the food was delicious. The second time was for the buffet."

Overall had a lovely experience.  We clearly focused on trying different dishes this trip.

We were shown our table upon arriving, menus and an ice bucket and water were brought right over. We discussed a few menu items ensuring they could adjust the spice levels.  Spicy foods no longer agree with us, unfortunately :(  but we don't want to miss out on flavor.

We started with the Thai Dumplings, asked for steams vs fried crispy, each dumpling is filled with ground pork, bamboo, and black mushrooms.  A nice mix, good flavor, however, we felt that mix was too tightly packed and felt heavy.  We love light, delicate Thai food selections.

Next, we had the crispy puff which was quite nice, light and fluffy.

For our entree's my wife had the Mussaman with chicken, nice think pieces of white meat chicken with veggies in a very light, tasty broth like curry sauce.

I had the Talay Tong- a mix of seafood (muscles, squid, shrimp,  in a nice light flavorful sauce.  The presentation was a work of plating presentation art.  

Fab night, great tasty food, all fresh colorful ingredients.
Angie was awesome.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This is my goto place at work.  I need to find a goto place at home this good!  Nice restaurant, free parking, good service and great food!  I go here at least once a week.  I don't do seafood, but I love the teriyaki here, both the steak and chicken.  What steals the show for me is their delicious Ginger dressing.  It's so good I asked for the recipe and was surprised that it is mostly fruits and veggies blended into a thick and delicious addition to any salad!  Also good is their house brewed ice tea, give it a shot and tell me you don't agree!  Finally...They have really nice bathrooms...I'm sure George Costanza would agree!  

Great place for lunch, the prices are amazing.  I believe there is a constant price war with other local Asian places, so you can get some amazing lunch specials here for under 10$. The staff is great, very nice, and the owner is quite knowledgeable about food\nutrition.   

Props to David G who nails it in his review: 

""Quiet competent service, outstandingly presented super fresh sushi, pleasantly elegant decor, generous portions, flawless tempura, clean and well appointed bathrooms...""

That sums it up nicely, stop in and see what you think!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Our party of four was seated immediately and the food was quickly delivered. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The drinks were also very tasty and reasonably priced. We had a very large group of six and it was a good size group for one. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and my daughter had the fish and chips. The food was very good. We will definitely be back for sure.Love the food here. Food is always fresh and hot. Highly recommend for vegetarians and vegans.Best burger I've had in a long time. 

We went on a Friday night and we were seated quickly. The place is small and cozy. It's a bit loud but that's okay. I don't mind if you're in the middle of the night and it's a bit loud, but it's not the loudest I've ever been. 

We started with the cheeseburger and my wife had the burger with a side of fries. We both ordered the fries and they were delicious. The burgers were nicely seasoned, juicy and seasoned well"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Drove several miles to pick up a pizza. We waited for a table and ordered. We waited for the server to bring out our pizza. He didn't take our order. After we had our pizza we walked out. The manager came out and apologized for the wait. He said it's not a good experience and will make sure we have a better experience. I asked for a refund and he said he would give it to us. He didn't even offer a refund. The pizza was good, but the manager never came to our table. He was very rude and rude and completely ignored us. We left. I don't know how they managed to get this far to close to my house. This is the only pizza I've had at a pizza place and I'm going to give it another shot. The food is very good, but the service is not the best. The service is slow and the food is not that great. The manager was very nice and offered to make sure everything was ok."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food was good but not great. The service was awesome; she accommodated my picky roommate (whom I love - she also acknowledges that she's particular lol) with a smile and everything came out correctly. She also let us hit up the 2 for 1 Bloody Mary deal even though we got sat at like 9:02 and it ended at 9:00. 

I also liked how you can mix n match with the eggs Benedicts and try two kinds - I got the fried chicken and pulled pork (yah I'm full right now). Didn't realize the mix and match doesn't come with a side of potatoes although it costs $2 more - kind of a buzz kill. Also it wasn't hot. And the hollandaise I think was from a can/mix. It was decent but didn't have a fresh, lemony, flavor. That being said it was still pretty good. I liked the pork and the chicken. 

This is my second time here and the time before was about the same in terms of food quality. It's pretty good but I think Elizabeth's is better (although a bit more expensive). 

Like the space; like the vibe. The manager (maybe owner, some person with authority) also checked in on us and was very sweet. So for all that I will come back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Friday night. Sat at the fireplace tables for 25 minutes, many servers looked at us but not one approached us. Finally my husband went to the hostess stand to see if wait these tables or if we had to get our own from the bar. He was told our waitress would be right over. She served drinks to the table next us but never glanced our way or at the people sitting on our other side. As my husband approached the bar another server that was serving the dining tables took our drink order and delivered our drinks. After we finished our drinks, no our waitress never came around we went to the hostess stand to put in for a table for dinner. We were seated right away on the far side of the restaurant from the patio bar. The music was completely different and nothing that resembled a Mexican establishment. Our server was quite good, Brian was quick, efficient and friendly. The food, blah. Nothing to write home about as far as Mexican goes. The drinks weren't great either. Again average. $102 later the 2 of us had average meals with average drinks and no service for the first 25 minutes. There is much improvement to be had here. We won't be back. Another blah BayStar experience."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"The Turkey Sandwich. It's not a turkey sandwich. It's a turkey sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. The turkey is thick and crispy, and the avocado is crisp and flavorful. The sandwich is covered in a creamy dressing that is reminiscent of tomato sauce. The turkey is perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of flavor. I love the decor of the restaurant, and the service is top notch. The restaurant is clean, and the staff is friendly. The prices are fair, and the food is consistently good. I'm not a huge fan of the prices on the lunch menu, but I have to say that it's not bad. It's not bad, but it's not great. The turkey sandwich is not bad, but it's not great either. It's better than some of the other places I've been to. My only suggestion would be to not order the ""cheese fries"" or the ""chicken breast. "" They are not very good either. The fries are good, but they're not amazing."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure of stopping in here for a drink and a bite. I had the Chicken Salad with a side of Tater tots. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. The Tater tots were good, but not great. The chicken salad was a bit too sweet for me. It was a little bland. I was quite surprised to see that the chicken was on the smaller side. I think that is why I wanted to try it, but I will probably stick with the chicken salad next time. The service was good. I really liked the decor. They have a nice outdoor seating area. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Tucson. I was looking for a new spot for pizza and this place did not disappoint. I got the tomato pie and my wife got the white pizza. Both were delicious. The pizza was very fresh and had good flavor. We both ordered the Greek salad and the red pizza. Both were very good. Our server was very nice and attentive."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Our server came Kiara was clearly @ the end of a long day & it showed, she sat down to take our order. Like in the booth with us.She attempted to memorize our order w/o writing it down. However, she ended up coming back to have part of the order repeated. 
We ordered the presidente margarita and cape cods w/ appetizers.... My margarita arrived in the same type of glass as the cape cods. The appetizer (egg rolls) were a little overdone, but we said nothing. Our server did apologize for the drinks taking so long. 
For my entree I ordered the fajitas (chicken & shrimp) and my bf ordered the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich.  The fajitas came out with the signature sizzle sound but lacked the steam and overall ambiance of usual.  My lettuce, cheese, pico, and sour cream all came out heaped together in the corner of a greasy dinner plate. The meat appeared wet & soggy not very appealing.  His sandwich also overdone, and with out the ranch dressing, we asked for it however she never brought it out.  I could go on however I think my point was made. We did not complain and even left a generous 15% tip. However Chillis we are done thanks for making sure of that."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I ended up here Saturday night after attending an event at PAFA. The general wasteland of north Broad Street was a rather daunting prospect in the chill and snow of the evening, but luckily one of my friends remembered that Prohibition Taproom was rather close. 

I'll start by echoing some of the other reviewers here - the staff is friendly, honest and down-to-earth. The same can be said for the food. The homemade potato chips (which, I think, were a special that night) barely touched the table before they were gone. I ordered the grilled cheese, the contents of which rotate often, which was just cheesy enough, without being greasy, on hearty, toasted bread. The draft selection was thoughtful and had something for everyone at my table. 

The only thing that threw me off was the room/atmosphere. The bar, which was large and dramatic, completely overpowered the dining tables opposite, which is where we were seated. It felt like we were forcibly divided from the more vibrant bar area by the sheer difference in size and a gulf between the bar and the tables. I'd like to see the place install high tops, so the dining area will feel more connected to the bar. At least we'd be on the same level.... 

I'll be back, and bring my friends...."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is by far the best place I've ever been to in Reno! The food is awesome and the service is very good. The only negative is the parking is a little difficult to find. They are still busy when I'm in Reno. If you're looking for a good Mexican restaurant and a fast service place, I would recommend this place!Delicious food and service! I will definitely be back. The pork belly was my favorite. The shrimp and grits were soooo good!I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. I was disappointed with the bread pudding. It was nothing special. I really liked the bread pudding. They do have a decent breakfast buffet but I would have liked to have had more variety of options for the food. I would recommend this place.Went here for the first time recently and was very happy with my experience. I was on a late night run and was greeted by a friendly server. I ordered a sampler of 5 of their small plates and the order was ready in under 5 minutes. I had a large order of red beans"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Dinner tonight was amazing, from the flavors and the food. I will definitely be back!Very disappointed. We had reservations for a Sunday night.  The hostess was not very attentive and we had to ask her to be more attentive.  We ordered the gyro and the chicken sandwich.  The chicken sandwich was ok, it had a very rubbery crust.  The gyro was good.  We also ordered the gyro and the chicken sandwich.  The gyro was very salty.  The chicken sandwich was good.  I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.Excellent food, and reasonably priced.  A must-visit spot.  Friendly staff and a good beer selection.  Parking is a little tight, but I've never been disappointed.This is a great find!  The food is very good, with good portions.  The service is excellent.  They always have fresh fruit on the menu and their smoothies are tasty.  I highly recommend the espresso martini and their delicious bread pudding.  They are BYOB so you can take"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Constitution Yards is how you'd hope Wilmington would be perceived and experienced, especially on a warm spring evening. It's spacious, safe, clean and has one of the best vibes you can find in the area. To top it off? They pour some absolutely amazing beers -- the ""best of"" microbrews. Your biggest problem will be choosing which one to splurge way too much money on for a pitcher or two to share with friends. They also serve food and have a text service to let you know when it's ready so you can get back to your friends while ensuring your order is fresh and hot! 

Great for large or small groups and since it's outside it is very Covid friendly. Also great for those who want to bring their kids OR those who want to leave them at home. They have a variety of games available and the space is broken up into several different areas to let you choose your crowd. Bathrooms were clean, even though they are in an outdoor trailer. 

They had the Phils playing on the tv while I was there - think an opportunity for improvement might be to add just a few more TVs to really kick this spot up a notch in the sports division. That's probably my only constructive feedback. 

Go."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Bought 2 tickets off Groupon as the wife wanted to visit the Mississippi River and check out the Chamlette Battlefield.

So we went during the day and payed for the buffet on the ship.
I can say the seafood pasta was awesome my wife only complaint was that the pasta was slightly under-cooked. Everything else was decent and the view from the ship was amazing. 

The tour guide who spoke over the loudspeaker given explanation of a brief history of the river and New Orleans was very informative and also quite funny.

When we arrived at the Chamlette Battlefield entrance by a dedicated dock for the Creole Queen we were met by a US Park Ranger.

From there we walk towards the visiting center with the Ranger and when we arrived there he explain would that the route we past by shows a large portion of where the British and Americans battle lines were during the Battle of New Orleans.  

It was a very informative explanations of what happened and visitor center also serve as a historical museum containing the uniforms and weapons used at the time.

Then we all returned to the ship to take the journey back to city.

If you can find the time while in New Orleans I highly suggest you to go and take a trip with the Creole Queen."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"4.5/5 stars. This location opened up a few years ago and has continued to improve. I have ordered takeout from here several times since then. The food is consistently good. The portions are huge. The staff is always friendly. I am always pleased with my food. I recommend this location.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant after a quick lunch. I ordered the chef's special, the pork chop with ham and the chicken with white rice. The pork chop was pretty good, but the ham was a little too sweet for my taste. The chicken was good, but the ham and pork chop were pretty salty. The bread was not great, but it tasted fresh and I enjoyed it. I would go back if I lived closer.I've been coming to this location for years now. I have only ever been for lunch and dinner. I've been here twice now, both times the food was great. I've never had a bad meal. I always get the beef and broccoli plate and it's delicious. The prices are very reasonable, it's"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Allow me to begin with that it was an experience. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty good, but the food was not great. The creole rice with the shrimp and the shrimp shank was very salty. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I did get the crab claws and they were a little salty. I didn't get the clam chowder which was ok. The shrimp and grits were not very good. I had to take a bite of my boyfriend's shrimp and grits, which was a little too salty. I would say that the food was decent but the service was not. We did not get dessert which is a nice thing to see. It was a nice surprise to see how they have a good menu and a reasonable price. I would probably go back again.This place is awesome. We had the chicken biryani, chicken naan, and chicken tikka masala. We all loved the food and the service. The naan was so flavorful, it was like it was sitting on"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I wish I took pictures during our experience but my meal was so good it didn't last too long!

We got into town on a Thursday and had made a reservation at Butcher & Bee for our first night in Nashville. 

If you don't know where you are going, or if your Uber driver doesn't know where it is (it's relatively new), it's hard to find at night. There is white on white writing on the building and no signage that sticks out. Just be aware of that when arriving. 

The ambiance definitely has a hipster vibe. I loved the open kitchen bar concept too. 

We started with the whipped feta and honey which was AMAZING. We also ordered the beef tartar. Wasn't my favorite. 

For dinner my boyfriend got the hanger steak which was pretty fun of the mill. I got the gnocchi. Let me tell you. This gnocchi was the best gnocchi I've seriously every had. It melts in your mouth and the sauce was perfect. Probably one of the best dishes I had while in Nashville. 

We also had the gingerbread whoopie pies. Pretty good as well. 

All in all it was definitely a good experience. It's a little over priced for what you get and the food is good. But I'd definitely be back for that amazing gnocchi."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We thought everything was amazing today! Our first time here and as you can see from my profile I am definitely a serious food judge! LOL. Anyhow my husband had the seafood fettuccine and the chef knows exactly what she or he is doing. The scallops are cooked to perfection and very clean, the shrimp was also perfect  as was the lobster! I got the fish and chips which the chips are actually steak fries that I absolutely loved because they weren't soaked in any type of fried oil! They may have even been baked but either way they were delicious and definitely hand cut. I forgot to mention we started out with the calamari and cheese sticks and both of those were very good my husband opted for a cup of New England clam chowder and they use some type of cooking sherry or some thing it had the most amazing distinct flavor ever! And they put fresh belly  clams in there which they have on the menu!  The server was amazing his name was Jeremy!! We cannot wait to go back I don't think that driving there from Homosassa is too far at all!!!  We are looking forward to you leftovers tonight because they give you such a ton of food and our next visit"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Dalessandro's is officially my cheesesteak go to, and it is good enough to make me a regular. The meat is always crisp and the meat is flavorful and the flavor is spot on. The only downside is that it is a bit on the pricey side for what you get.The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the lamb gyro and it was excellent. I also had the chicken tikka masala which was delicious. The portion size was perfect and the price was right. I would highly recommend the tikka masala.This place is great!  We had a great meal here.  The food was amazing.  The only thing we did not like was the sauce on the fish, but the service was excellent.  The service was also top notch.  Our waiter was very helpful and attentive.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.This place is a must visit for any traveler! The service is outstanding and the food is amazing!

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I have always wanted to go to the restaurant and try out the brunch menu, but I just can't get over the lack of food.  The chicken was dry and the sausage was dry.  I ordered the French toast which was very good.  I also ordered the short rib with eggs.  The short rib was cooked very well and the potatoes were cooked very well.  The potatoes were cooked very well and the eggs were cooked very well.  The short rib was very juicy and very tender.  The eggs were cooked very well, but the potatoes were not seasoned well.  I had a hard time picking out the potatoes because it was not my first time.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars was because it was not my first time at the restaurant.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Went there for lunch and the place was filled with smoke.  Ordered 2 sandwiches to go.  Cashier said it would be 10-15 minutes.  Asked about my order 20 minutes later and they said 10 more minutes.  Came back in 10 minutes and it still wasn't ready.  They said they would bring it to me as I waited outside.  Ten minutes later I noticed other people who arrived after us getting their food.  Went back inside to check on the order, they asked my name, and then realized they gave my order to somebody else.  The guy ran out the door to flag down the customer, grabbed my lunch and brought it back inside to me with no apology.  I said he needed to get it together.  The place was filled with smoke, the food prep area was a disaster, orders were being filled out of order, taking a long time, and given to the wrong customers.  He said I shouldn't say such things and asked me to leave.  I was like, really?  No apology, no attempt to admit your shortcomings, no empathy, no thanks for the customer's patience, nothing.  He said something about his nationality as I was walking away.  Like it trumped all reasoning.  Unbelievable."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm a little conflicted about this location, it's named partly after the old Melrose Lanes bowling alley which closed after sixty-three years of service to the community. I've watched too much of old Nashville sacrificed for the upscale dinning/shopping/living space, gentrified places are no longer affordable or welcoming to work-a-day folk. I have very little patience for the bourgeoisie.
I never bowled at the Melrose Lanes but I spent many an hour drinking beer and playing shuffleboard down there. (The lanes were downstairs below the old Sutler.) They made a wonderful chili dog topped with fresh Vidalia onion. No more, no more.
Anyway, I enjoyed the Corned Beef Hash, a sauerkraut potato hash with corned beef brisket, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. Even though the sauerkraut wasn't very evident, (that might be a good thing,)  it may be the best hash I've ever had. Addictive even.
The coffee is another reason to go to Fenwick's. I really liked the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. After all, this IS a Bongo Java joint.
The decor sends mixed messages. It's trying to be reminiscent of a homey feeling (exposed brick) diner but with over-elegant lighting fixtures and unforgiving stools and hard little chairs. It's not the most comfortable place to eat, but the food is good and I'll overlook a lot for good food, even a small amount of pretense."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I still love this Hooters. We have been there many times and it's always a fun time. The atmosphere is great. The staff is always friendly and the food is delicious. I love that it's a little smaller than other Hooters locations. If you're looking for a good lunch with friends, this place is a great option.I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami. It was amazing! I can't say enough about the atmosphere. The staff was super friendly and attentive. My only complaint is that I would've loved to have gotten a coffee to go instead of a dessert but the staff is so friendly and it's worth it. We'll definitely be back!Was looking forward to this place to finally get a chance to eat here. I was a little worried that they wouldn't have the best looking menu, but I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the Salmon, Houseplant, and Veal Relleno. All were delicious. The Salmon was cooked perfectly and the Veal Relleno was just right. The Salmon was cooked perfectly and the houseplant was delicious"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I had flashbacks to my time in the French Quarter. I visited this place for the first time. It's not the best I've had in the city, but the food is pretty good. The fried chicken is amazing. I would come back for the wings. I ordered the blackened chicken with fried rice. I ate most of the food, and it was a solid meal. I liked the grilled chicken with fried rice. The fried rice was good, but I would not go back for that dish. It's not the best I've had in New Orleans, but it was a solid meal. I would say this place is a decent place for some great food.I stopped in here for lunch and it was a nice surprise. It was a cute little restaurant and I had a nice view of the water. It was very clean and the staff was nice. I ordered the fish tacos which were very good. The fish was very fresh and had good flavor. The taco was a little on the small side but worth it.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Atmosphere is whatever. Would be a good place to go to watch a game, and have some drinks, etc. Food:

Ordered the sweet potato and conch fritters which were pretty darn good. It's not hard to make something fried good, to be honest, but the flavors went well together and it definitely tasted like more than just a fried ball. I'd recommend these. I wasn't too hungry so I only ordered one taco: the scallop taco. Was probably a bad move in hindsight. ya know, how good could their scallops be? Well, the scallop wasn't the problem it was the add-ons. The caramelized onion jam was way too sweet (it's all you could taste), and the fried leeks added nothing. the scallops were fine, but other than that, the taco just wasn't good. I had a bite of a fish taco that was pretty good. The coconut mango rice was pretty awful. tasted like it was made that morning, and sat in a non heated pot for 12 hours. That's all I ate, but I can just imagine based on the fish taco, and the size of the menu, that they don't do anything REALLY well, but do a bunch of things ok. I'd say you could get better food somewhere else for the same price, but if you're into this kind of place, try it out."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I am torn!  I do like the taste of their pizza and the price.  A very good value and it is eaten hot and fresh out of my oven.  I fed an army of teenage boys with the family size 5 meat stuff crust pizza. I They raved about my culinary talent and I thought it was quite tasty

My complaint with this visit (and loss of two stars) comes in the on-line ordering.  I ordered on-line and was offered a 25% off coupon for the order.  I tried to enter the code and was rejected repeatedly.  I sent a note with the order requesting the discount when I picked up the pizza(s).  The web site states that the credit card is NOT charged until you present the card at pizza pickup, so I figured I was safe to get the sizable discount.  When I picked up the pizzas I was told the discount was impossible as the card was charged at time of order.  Credit card mischief by the company!  A pet peeve of mine.  The manager did offer a ""free side"" to ease the pain but I was told the fault was mine for not entering the code correctly.  Really?  Three attempts?  Good thing the pizza was delicious...."

I got the veggie burger with fries and a side of avocado. It was so delicious and super filling. It was definitely a hit or miss for me.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Found this gem after a kayaking trip at Marsh Creek State Park (just around the corner). 
The food is fresh and served in a timely manner. 

Roast beef is sliced fresh, none of that prepackaged salty muck thats been sitting in a pan for god knows how long. Wawa doesn't have anything on these hoagies. Quality meat, cheese and veggies all the way.

The staff is A+ on service. Friendly, open and even went so far to double check we had everything we needed and that the food was good -All that and we were sitting outside. Yes, he came outside to make sure everything was on point and I'm pretty sure he wasn't the owner. 5 star service I haven't had seen in a while.

The shop has an array of cheese (I wanted to buy it all), meats, olives, frozen goodies and pasta stuffs. What appeared to be fresh baked rolls for sale. Piano in the corner (Is that worth noting?) 

Seating is adequate for couples or groups if need be. casual and open.  Out door seating is nice and they have a neat little garden and chickens off to the side so I'm sure that's where part of their freshness comes from.

Parking is plentiful. 

I highly recommend you stop in to abandon your false wawa gods and partake in a real hoagie."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Came here once again with my family friend, and was totally impressed! Most of the food is vegan friendly as well as organic! Their menu is actually quite large and is filled with salads, soups, sandwiches, waffles, and pastas for dinner. The first time I came I ordered the Beautiful BLTA served on naan with the fruit bowl as my side. They offer quinoa salad, chips, and a fruit bowl with each entree. My aunt got the veggie sandwich with vegan cheese and the fruit bowl. I'm a big fan of meat and dairy but I've got to say that veggie sandwich was delicious! My BLTA was so flavorful and yummy. I came a second time a couple of days ago and ordered the Bedazzle Liege waffle and it was DELICIOUS. The waffle has sugar crystals baked into the waffle and it's actually made from a dough, not a batter! It was topped off with cheese, bacon, and a sunny side up egg and although it's a pretty small portion, the waffle itself is quite rich and amazingly delicious. My boyfriend had the wild alaskan salmon sandwich with the quinoa salad and was delicious! The staff and owner are very friendly and efficient. They also allow you to sign up with your email to receive special offers and discounts for coming in and eating!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Normally, if you'd ask me what I wanted to order, I'd say that I'd order the chicken. The chicken is definitely a solid choice, but if you're a fan of chicken, it's hard to get a flavor from this dish. This is a great choice for a special occasion. I did get a free appetizer (which was a really great deal), but I had to ask for a second to go. I ended up getting a side of the spicy garlic bread for dipping, which was a really nice touch. I was just a little disappointed with the bread. I really liked the bread, and I could have eaten it for lunch. The waitress was really nice. She helped me choose my order and helped me choose a drink. She also gave me a sample of the following drinks:

My husband got the mahi mahi and he said it was amazing. He also got the baklava and said it was good. I got the roasted vegetable sampler platter."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Ate at Clementines Stable Cafe last night and the food was good. The cheese steak was awesome. The Brie fries were a bit dry but the flavor was good. The only thing that was disappointing was the server's attitude. I don't think she was very friendly. I think she was just the most annoying person. I think I will come back. We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed. I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the salmon salad. Both were very good and our server was very nice. We will definitely come back!I love the concept of this place. It is a must for any diner in Santa Barbara. I went here for the first time and I had a great time. I started with the special with the Brie. It was delicious and had a nice spice to it. I would definitely order it again. My husband had the beef and cheese plate and it was delicious. He had the hash browns and eggs.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Perfect lunch for the hot and sour soup. 

We will be back!Very good. Very friendly service. The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside tables were dirty. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place.The food is good, but the service is not. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken sandwich. It's very dry. The sandwiches are very good, but the sandwiches are too small for me. 

I usually go for the lunch buffet. It is mostly healthy food, but the prices are not very high for the quality of food. I usually get the ""raw"" salad, which is a salad of lettuce, tomato, and a mix of tomato, cheese, and dressing. I usually get the regular salad and the salad of fresh vegetables. The salad is very fresh and the veggies are tasty. I normally get the beef and broccoli salad and it's good. However, the salad is not so good that I don't eat it every day."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place had a great vibe to it. Me and my friends came here before a concert at the Hi-Fi. Once you enter, it's pretty dark and moody, but then it leads into the bar and patio area, which is huge! Did not expect it to be as large as it was. There was a tiki theme fully decked out in all beach stuff. The drink menu had a lot of inspired tropical drinks to make you really feel like you're somewhere tropical. The food menu had a good selection of different tacos and chip and dip options. They also had a lot of burger options with fries. The only thing I wish you could do it mix and match tacos. Each taco order came with 2 tacos but you can't get 2 different kinds. They are a little pricey too, in my opinion. I ordered the pork tacos, which were dry. My friend had shrimp and we split. The shrimp tacos were great! Highly recommend those over pork. The servers were nice but the service was a little on the slow side. Also, our waiter didn't inform us that napkins and other sauces were at a station near the bar, which would have been nice to know. We didn't even realize until we were halfway done. That probably would have solved my dry taco problem."
Restaurants,1.5,OR,"We are new to the area and wanted to find our new go-to pizza joint. This was not it. I ordered 3 pizzas, 2 orders of wings and the garlic knots to be delivered through grub-hub at around 630-640 pm because we would not be home until then. The delivery guy called me at 6 to ask if I was home because he was there already. I was not, so he took the order back to the restaurant, then brought the same order (now over an hour since making) back around 650 pm. Needless to say, the pizzas were cold and greasy and did not taste good. I am not sure they would have tasted much better fresh either simply because I could literally hold them up to the light and see straight through the slice of buffalo chicken pizza. Additionally, when he returned with the food, we were missing one of the orders of wings. When I called to let them know, the girl who answered had to call the manager to ask what to do and there was some guy in the back ground yelling like he was angry. She called me back and was able to refund the price of the wings we did not receive along with about 25% of the total price of the order. We will not be back."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We really appreciated the owner reaching out to us directly. It was enough for us to give this place another shot. We've been back a few times and service has been pretty good. We definitely did not experience anything like our first visit. 

The kids meals are great - I appreciate that broccoli is a side option.  Last night our meal was fairly good. We all loved the jalapeño corn and the mashed potatoes were decent as well. The only exception was the meatloaf. Let me tell you, I LOVE meatloaf. What they served last night seemed like it came from a frozen food service package. It was more like frozen Salisbury steak from the Kroger freezer aisle than actual meatloaf. Regardless of whether it was a frozen prepackaged product, or if someone actually made this from scratch, it needs some serious work.  I'd be happy to share what real meatloaf looks and tastes like, just like my momma and granny make. Please make some adjustments to this dish or scrap it all together from your menu. 

Now that my meatloaf rant is over, I will say that I think you guys are doing a good job with this place. I'm hopeful that you'll keep up the positive changes and this location will never again turn into the dump that was Bella Vita."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My partner loves a cheap, tasty, and filling burger.  We also have the local beer.  If we had to choose, we'd get the Taurus.  It's a burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles.  It's a great burger.  We also order the spicy tuna and it's fantastic.  The tuna is a little spicy but it's just right.  I love the spicy tuna.  I like that they have a ton of options for your burger.  The burgers are a little too greasy.  They are usually a little too salty but the burgers are great.  The fries are also great.  We love their location.  They have a patio to sit and watch the game.  It's also a great place for a quick bite.  My partner loves the hamburger.  It's good, but not great.  I don't think I'd order it again.  My other burger is a little on the salty side but it's good.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for a burger that's more on the salty"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Was looking for a low key place to go to for a quick dinner, and I was disappointed. I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was just okay. It was a bit on the salty side for my liking, but it was definitely flavorful and a bit sweet for my taste. I would definitely go back just to try the bread pudding. It was a bit pricey for what you get, but it was well worth it. We had a party of 6 and the service was absolutely awful. We had to wait for a table for 15 minutes before we were finally seated. The waiter was not friendly at all. It took forever to get the check and the food was cold. We had to ask for napkins and our water was empty. Our waiter was not very nice. I don't think we will ever go back. Very cute little cafe. Very friendly staff. Food was amazing. I had the panini with a side of spinach and mushrooms and it was delicious. The s'mores was amazing. The staff was very friendly and attentive."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Pho...the food that everybody turns to after a night if drinking. But just letting everybody know when I went it wasn't because I'm dehydrated and need soupy stuff. I actually come here with my family often. My sis and my parents love the fresh chicken pho. The chicken isn't too fatty and the meat is tender.  On this Sunday I went with my friend, her daughter and my nephew. I ordered a pho deluxe and she a chicken rice dish. I had forgot my nephew kids food scissors to cut up his food and the waiter brought the restaurant's pair for kids right over. I was impressed that the waiter was so tentative for such a cost friendly place. 
I have ate at a lot of pho places in and around the area of Philly and I must say many places over load on msg in their soups. You can't tell this by the amount of water you need to drink afterwards. But this place goes easy on the msg. Their noodles and apps are goods and served quickly. The service is great not only because they had scissors but I told the waiter to give my nephew the ""you better eat look or timeout"" and my nephew started crying, The waiter comes over and said to him I was just kidding :) awww haha"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My friends and I have had a standing reservation at Han for about two years (give or take, seems like forever!). Each week we are greeted by the staff, who by now we consider as our friends, and are seated almost immediately. We've had everything on the menu and some items of the secret menu!  Since some in our group are vegetarian and/or muslim, we special order all the time.  No pork, no problem, you can still have the awesome Dan Dan Noodles!  No meat, no problem, most of the dishes can be made with tofu!  We haven't had a bad dish yet!  Can wait until Han gets back from his trip and shares all the new things he learned!

Some pointers for newbies:
Make a reservation.  You don't want the table of shame by the door.
Its no longer BYOB, but you can BYOB but be prepared for steep corkage fees.
Be prepared to share. The food is served family style, so order appropriately. 
Good rules for ordering for groups...order one Dan Dan and one other app, order one less entree than people in your group, order at least one veg (the cabbage or eggplant are excellent pairs with most entrees). 
Don't ask for soy sauce, or duck sauce, or for a fortune cookie...you'll look like a moron and rightfully treated as such!"

I highly recommend this place.I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries. I like their chicken wings, but it's kind of hard to tell. They're cooked to perfection and the sauce is sweet. I've also tried their fries and I've had a few bites of their fries, but it's not the best I've had. The fries are pretty small, but not too soggy either.

- Nevada is still allowing indoor dining (late December 2020)
- Old register lady had a surgical mask on, but pulled it down to talk 50% of the time or had one ear loop off 
- Happy chatty man had a cloth mask on, but also pulled it down frequently and would forget to pull back up
- Kitchen staff, I can't recall with precision, but I remember how the scene made me feel, and that's what sticks at the end of the day.

In terms of handling COVID, this place is not the best. I understand that this is NV and not CA, but it's hard to show support for businesses who don't take the current safety measures put in place for this pandemic as seriously as possible.

Food Review:
My partner and I ordered pho with everything in it. The broth is probably the most important part of this dish IMO. Next would be the meats. I found the broth to be lacking in flavor, which was disappointing as hell after a day of skiing. The meat was decent enough to just fill my stomach and get me through the night.

Maybe their soup noodles are not their strength?

They're definitely very nice people. I just wouldn't come here with high hopes of having that bowl of pho hit the spot on a cold and long day.

Will not be returning."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Really bad last night. Arrived at 7:45 with a group. The 2 people aHEAD OF US IN LINE finally GAVE UP AFTER WAITING a long time. Their food sat waiting for the toppings and getting cold. The first position set up some of our orders and then disappeared. There were 5 people behind the counter but no one in the 2nd position. So the beginnings of bowls and burritos just sat getting cold and soggy. There were plenty (5) of employees standing around. We asked for a manager, got atittude. There are 3 managers here. Well could someone step up and make our food? No I'm on the chip station. But all the orders ARE BOTTLE-necked before the chip station so you have nothing to do. Yep, she didn't budge. Finally, someone stepped up and started making our food. After it sat for 10 minutes. We would have left too but one of our group had gotten her food before the entire staff quit working. Cherry on the top: at check-out, the chip lady who hadnt moved asked one of my group ""Do you have a problem with me, I think I saw you roll your eyes at me?""  Thought a fight might break-out in Moe's because we had the audacity to expect the crew to prep our orders. And the food was gross and cold."

Restaurants,2.5,OR,"This used to be my favorite subway to come to, but after today, not so much. This place used to have some really great girls working here, who were super friendly. The manager/owner is still nice, so I appreciate that at least. I got over charged when I was paying for my food, so I tell the girl who was ringing me up, Keiry, that I've never been charged this much before. She shrugs her shoulders and takes my money. No explanation or break down of the charges. Gives me my change (which was the wrong change), and again I have to ask about the total because it seemed like a lot. Turns out she charged me for a sandwich I didn't get. She refunds that. Then I have to go back to point out that she gave me the wrong change. Not once did she apologize, or even really acknowledge that it was her fault. If it wasn't for me saying something twice, I would have paid more than I was supposed to. And I get that mistakes happen, but why the attitude? It wasn't my fault that I was over charged, or given the wrong change. I'm a paying customer, and it's not my fault if you don't like your job. I suggest finding a different job, because customer service probably isn't the place for you."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Rio bravo suffers from what a multitude of ""Mexican"" restaurants are suffering from, an addiction to serving texmex style food, everything covered in cheese and sauce while being so under seasoned you could literally be eating a shoe and it would taste the same. I'm a fan of supporting local joints especially during covid so take this review as constructive criticism and not an all out call to close down. Change up the menu guys, you're not serving Mexican food your serving cheese with a side of bad beans and bland rice. Change up the crockery, work on presentation and for the love of all that is Mexican please cook real Mexican food that's full of flavor, spice, color and brightness. Nothing is more depressing than ordering a platter of your specialties and then when it arrives I don't know what's on my plate because it all looks like a monochromatic cheese soup. Visit some of your competitors and pick up tips from them. You could do so much better. I can't recommend going here to eat but I can recommend having a few beers and munching on the chips and salsa that was the best part of my experience here. Try Casa Vieja if you're looking to eat Mexican, it's a big step up from Rio and it's close to this location. Pls Rio fix your food."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The only redeeming thing about this Marriott is location.  Definitely not worthy of the Marriott name.  Easy walking to French Quarter, Warehouse district and street car to garden district.

We stayed at the 25th floor but we can hear street noise from people, street car and etc.  We were several doors around the corner from the elevators and I could hear the 'ding' from the elevators.  It 'ding' on every floor as it went up and down excessively.

The worst part is housekeeping.  We stayed eight nights.  We were out the entire day and usually not back until after 6p and there were not one day that our room was made when we got back.  We called and they said they will let housekeeping know but nothing happened for 2 hrs.  We went down and complained like 5-6 times and housekeeping finally showed up at 9:30p.  Seriously??  My kid was asleep by then.  It was the same thing the next day.  We asked to talk to the manager and they didn't seem to care.  Out of the 8 nights,  we only have 1 day of housekeeping service and that was after we complained and complained.  We gave up after that.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Went here on Saturday for a birthday party, and at first I was excited to go. When we got there, it was located in a dark alleyway off of South street and you had to be buzzed in to enter the restaurant. The staff had managed to squeeze 17 people into 2 tables, which made it very awkward to try and eat. 

The first course was marinated vegetables which you use your pita bread to scoop up. This wasn't such a hit with the party. The second course of an egg/meat pie was better, but not by much. By the time we saw the chicken come out, we were all hungry & excited. We all dug in happily, & then we started to chew. The chicken was so dry & overcooked! When the lamb kabobs came out, they were so salty and the sweet lamb dish was gamey. A complete fail all around. The only thing that made up for the bad dinner was the fruit course with the side of baklava, the mint tea & the birthday cake (which we had provided)

The belly dancer also only came for about 5 mins. We had pre-tipped her, but she still came with a $5 tucked into her skirt, as if she was asking for more money.

I'm sure this is a great place, but maybe not for such a big party."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,I was in here on Friday night. We were promptly greeted by a polite woman who took our name and set us up with a pager as there was a 25 minute wait. We found seats at the bar while we waited. The bartender quickly greeted us and gave us a beer list and drink menu that also highlighted their happy hour and daily specials. I ordered the Game of Thrones beer they had on draft which was a stout. My wife ordered a rum punch cooler. The bartender told us about their happy hour appetizer specials which are all half off. We ordered a crab cake to split while we waited for our table. The crab cake was delicious and mouth watering and came with a generous side of sautéed spinach. This was unbelievable for the half price special of $5.50. When we were seated we were greeted kindly by our server who explained the weekend dinner specials. I had the lobster stuffed with crab meat which was a Mother's Day special but available all weekend. I did expect much from such a special but it was incredible. I wish this was a permeant entree! My wife opted for the veal parm which was served with a generous side of spaghetti with a flavorful sauce. I had an amazing night and will definitely be back sooner rather than later!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?  Or in this case, Zim Zari or Surf Shack?  Either way, and despite the fact that the menus are 95% identical, I prefer Surf Shack.  Why?  Because at SS, the service is more friendly, and the food was prepared a little better.  I will give Zim Zari props on speed though.  Our tacos came out super fast.  It was busy for Taco Tuesday, so we sat outside (frist come, first serve) to avoid the 30 minute wait, but we couldn't help but feel ignored out there.  We were never asked how the food was, nor were we ever asked if we needed refills on our drinks.  Big customer service flops, IMHO.  The one major plus at Zim Zari was a taco that we do not get at Surf Shack, the chicken tinga taco.  Very good, and should definitely be incorporated into the SS menu!

Zim Zari is located at the corner of 54 and Little Rd. in a very busy plaza, so parking can be tricky.  I saw a lot of people duking it out over parking spots while we were eating.  So if you're planning on hitting Taco Tuesday, come early (before 5 PM), or late (after 7:30 PM).

All-in-all, the visit was OK, but I'm not sure I'll return."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Like many people, I came to Block 1912 while waiting for a movie showing at the Princess Theatre. Aside from the hipster and pleasant vibes of the cafe, the free wifi and tons of ample seating, the food and drink are average, but the service is pretty lackluster. 

My boyfriend and I ordered a blueberry cheesecake and London fog, having worked as a barista, the London fog was well done, and the cheesecake was ok. However, I ordered their cream of spinach soup an hour later, and the soup took about 20 minutes to arrive, the bowl it came in was really dirty, and the bread tasted stale. I inquired with a worker there who apologized and sheepishly admitted that she overmicrowaved the soup so it splattered outside the bowl, she must have seen my disappointment because the long wait combined with the disheveled state that the soup came in was  definitely not worth the money. The girl whom I talked to about the soup later offered me a take-out version of their soup as an apology--while that was a kind gesture and I really appreciate it, but I turned the offer down. This coffee shop definitely isn't awful, but the bad soup and the slow service despite not many people inside has me thinking twice, so I'll probably check out another coffee shop nearby next time before Block 1912."

I think this place is going to be a regular stop for me. I will most likely be going back to try the other items on the menu.My wife and I went to the restaurant last night with our son. We got a table outside and had to wait a few minutes for our waitress. We ordered drinks and appetizers. The waitress was very nice and the food came out really fast. We ordered a ""fine"" appetizer and it was good. My wife got the bbq shrimp. It was a lot of shrimp and sauce and the sauce was not my favorite. She said the sauce was good. I had the crab fries and they were very good. I think I would go back next time we are in town.I always order the ""Thai Sushi"" with pork, spicy tuna, and rice. The pork was very good. The spicy tuna was ok. The spicy tuna was not spicy at all. The rice was very good. The spicy tuna was ok."

The server was a bit lazy. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I had the pork chop and it was good but nothing special. I liked the atmosphere. The service was good and the food was good. We will be back.We had a party of 6 and the service was absolutely awful. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table and we were told that they didn't have any specials. We were told that they had some specials and we could order from the menu. We were told that they were going to have a pizza with the specials and the manager would have to make it up to us. We had to go to the bar to get our pizza and they did not even have the specials. After being told that they didn't have the specials, we just ordered pizza. After waiting another 10 minutes, we decided to go to the bar. They were told that the specials"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My experience at Dawson's on Main took place on a Friday lunch. The staff was friendly and greeted me as soon as I came into the door to kick off the small town feel for the visit. It was close to Fat Tuesday so servers wore Mardi Gras beads to be festive (ta-tas stayed in). We had a great server. She greeted us promptly and was able to accurately take our orders without writing anything down, a method which I view as something you can do with experience. She was friendly and seemed happy to be at work. 

Let's get to the main attraction, food. I chose to get the black and bleu sandwich on this visit. It was really good. Instead of a traditional hamburger patty, it was shaved prime rib. There was a creamy sauce on the sandwich that had horseradish on it and it was delicious. I caught myself licking my fingers like I was at a bbq eating contest. The fries were good too, they weren't anything super special but they were good enough that I made sure I finished them all. 

Atmosphere: Dawson's gives a classic American restaurant vibe. Most dishes are classic American cuisine and some might have a little bit of a flare. Space in the restaurant is comfortable and amble to accomidate larger groups. 

Street parking is free (with the exception of race weeks)."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Went to Burger King 3/10/2021 10:35pm. Ordered a #6 Whopper jr , with extra onions and heavy Mayo with onion rings and a coke. Also wanted a 2nd Whopper Jr the same way. I paid $8.46!
I received my meal and drove away back home near largo mall. Once I pulled in my driveway I noticed my Whopper jr was nothing more then a cheeseburger with Mayo only. Both sandwiches were the same. I drove all the way back to get my sandwich's fixed!! I called ahead of time and spoke with blk male manager on duty, and he said they will be fixed and ready when I got back there.
Upon getting back he apologized and said that he took the order but didn't make it. He said Mario the manager in training made it. So the manager gave me my new sandwiches and said to check them before I left . To both our surprise, both sandwiches again were only meat, cheese, bun, and Mayo .... The manger got upset and told me to give him the burgers back. 

At this point I just wanted my money back and would never return. That wasn't an option!! After about 5 more minutes wait , he brings me a bag of 2 more sandwiches. 

Now I'm afraid to even touch it, let alone eat it after having it returned twice.

This place needs serious help!!!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Well this was my first time here and the food was good. The service was good. The place is small and small, but the food is very good. The only thing I would change is to have the service to be better. I would come back to try the other menu items. Delicious food and service!  We had the grilled salmon with pork belly and it was delicious!  The prices are very reasonable for what you get!  I'm going back soon!I love this place! I love the atmosphere, and the food is always delicious! The staff is super friendly and accommodating. We love coming here, and I highly recommend it to everyone. I've been here several times now, and I'll be back!Went here for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised. We were seated right away, which was very nice. The food was very good. I ordered the spicy tuna roll, which came with a lot of avocado. The roll was very crispy, and the avocado was well seasoned. The tuna was very tasty, and the roll itself was very tasty."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I was treated to lunch here last night with my family.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.   The place was packed and the staff was friendly.   The food was good and the service was good.  The food was prepared with care and the staff was attentive and helpful.   I will return and try the chicken teriyaki ramen.  I will say that the portions are a little small for the price.  It's very filling.   I had the chicken teriyaki ramen and my husband had the ramen with pork.   The portions were a little small but the food was good.  We were there for lunch and I would recommend going to a place to eat.  I would recommend this place for lunch or dinner.Went here for the first time recently and was very happy with my experience. I had the veggie pizza which was really tasty and my husband had the meatballs. We both ordered the Greek salad and the veggie pizza. Both were very good.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"First of all, let me say we have been going here for a few years. We keep going back because the food is good, the price is decent, and the servers are usually very nice, which is the only reason they get 2 stars. 
However, today was the last time we set foot in there. We went there specifically because we have some gift cards we wanted to use, and it had been a while since we went in for the breakfast buffet, which is suppose to be over at 1130. We got there a bit before 11 and were disappointed to find the breakfast replaced by lunch, but we stayed. When it came time to pay we realized they were not only charging us the lunch buffet, but they REFUSED to take our gift cards. Stating they couldn't be used during the buffet. GIFT CARDS, not coupons. We talked to two waitresses and the manager, and they refused to budge. Ended up paying over $40 instead of the $20 some I was suppose to pay out of pocket, and now I have $20 worth of gift cards I'll never get to use. Needless to say, THIS CROOKS WILL NEVER GET ANY MORE OF MY MONEY OR BUSINESS. And I'm upset because I've recommended them to a few people. Now I will try to make sure everyone knows how good they are NOT."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This gem of a restaurant just gets better and better.
It's been over a year since we've had the opportunity to dine here and I was really looking forward to our return. Thought it was incredible the last time but   found that the chef has impossibly managed to raise the bar yet again.
Everything about the dining experience at Fork is stellar. The server is downright enthusiastic  about  explaining the unique menu offerings. This restaurant is so proud of their chef, as well they should be. I also  love being greeted by the owner who stopped by our table to ask how we were   enjoying our evening.
And we enjoyed it immensely. We ordered the 4 course prix fixe  and everything was delicious. Highly recommend the Roots starter and the ""chick pea"" pasta that we shared. Husband had the smoked char and I ordered the Colorado lamb as our main dishes. Both were delectable. Everything  was so flavorful in a ""multilayered""  way ,for lack of a better descriptive term. The lamb may have been the best I've ever had.
The pacing of the meal was perfect. The staff was highly attentive without being intrusive through out the 2 hours we were there.
Kudos to Fork for offering a different menu every time we've visited and for making this one of our top choices for dining in Old City."

I would give it another shot but I will definitely not go back.This place has some of the best burgers in town. I always get the shrimp and grits.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Acme Oyster House is a very popular casual table service restaurant in The Vieux Carre' just a 1/2 block from Bourbon. It's been around for a long time and is known for fresh shucked oysters and other seafood meals. In a town that's full of seafood and Cajun/ Creole restaurants it's their Peacemaker po boy that keeps bringing me back here.

There are many good po boys in New Orleans (Parkway Bakery & Tavern, Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop, Johnny's, Felix's, etc.). After all its just good French bread with seafood or meat and then being dressed with lettuce, tomato, etc. Acme's Peacemaker is different in that they use a Tabasco infused mayonnaise that really adds a nice flavor to the sandwich with the fried shrimp and oysters inside. That's exactly what I had a couple of weeks ago while in town and I added cole slaw as a side.

It was very tasty as usual. How can you go wrong with shrimp and oysters in a po boy? The mayo spread made it even better with that slight Tabasco kick. The cole slaw was cool and refreshing making it an excellent palate cleanser. 

The only problem with coming to eat here is it's popularity. The restaurant isn't that large inside so a line outside forms often. I would wait 15 minutes to get inside but not 30 due to all of the other nearby dining options."

I prefer to patronize independent businesses whenever I have the opportunity. I do not watch stupid reality tele as I live in the real world I do not see the need to watch it. But, I also do not watch much tele. That being said, I did not watch the Cupcake Wars but I do think it is an honor that a St Louis cupcakery won the first show. 

I usually enjoy the cupcake I purchase, but I did not this time. Root beer cupcake. You could definitely taste the root beer, but the cake was dry. Too much icing, for me. I took it my AMVETs Post and several people took a bite....or 2. 

My Grandmother very much enjoyed her 24 Karat cupcake, and loved how sparkly it was. We returned a few days later and purchased a Reese's cupcake for my Aunt's birthday. Now, my Aunt is a peanut butter freak, so unless it was rancid, she'd love it. And did!! I do wonder where she gets some of her ideas...Chicken & Waffle Cupcake.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Round two of Great Full Gardens was a much better experience than the first! Now that more covid restrictions have been lifted, this was an opportunity to return and try out their dine-in service and see if they can redeem themselves from our last trip.

We ordered the Grilled Portobello Deluxe ($14.50) since it came loaded with mushrooms, avocado, pea shoots, vegan cheese, and grilled onions. They also used a different vegan friendly spread for us instead of their garlic aioli. We got it with a side of their quinoa salad which was refreshing and tangy. Loved this burger overall and would definitely get it again since it was packed with so many greens.

Our other dish was the Jackfruit BBQ Sandwich ($13) which was shredded jackfruit in a sweet and tangy sauce on a sourdough ciabatta. Oh, and there was also supposed to be a house slaw on the side to include, but unfortunately that never came. As we were eating the jackfruit, we felt like something was missing from the dish. We didn't realize we never got any slaw and thought... welp, we just finished the sandwich so we can't just ask for it now.

So while it was a better experience this time around, from both times I've been here, they've forgotten a key ingredient in a dish that makes it whole. Definitely make sure your dish has everything on it before you leave/start eating."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Neat interior tables are different themes.  Ours was dedicated to cars.  It seemed appropriate since once of our party was a recent automotive engineering graduate.  It has some really cool art work for sale inside the restaurant.  It is near the garden district.  

I had the Miga which was great. The grits were awesome.  Eggs were perfect.  The biscuits were ideal.  The gravy however was kinda strange.  It had both mushroom and sausage in it.  I was not really felling the love.  I enjoy both kinds of gravy and on paper it sounds great, but executed it was not very good.    

Some members of out party got the boudin and the bacon.  These were life changing and this is spoken from a Southern Illinois pig farmer dedicating his life to making pig an endangered species.  

The Banana foster french toast was huge and delish.   I am more of a savory breakfast guy.  But this was spectacular.  

The Banana pancake was the size of the platter.  Probably 5 pancakes across and 2 thick.  It tasted like banana bread.  This would have been awesome with ice cream, syrup and whip cream for dessert.

He liked it, but I didn't. The rice was a little salty, but he was still satisfied with his meal. The chicken salad was good, but I didn't really like it.

This place is disgustingly filthy, the trash in the cooking area was overflowing and workers were stepping on trash. 70% of the tables were dirty!

I've eaten here before and was sat in the front room which is darker and more cramped, but we got a table in the back this time around which was much better. Our group was throwing a surprise party here and the staff was extremely accommodating to us.

We were able to get a deal for $45 that is similar to their restaurant week deal. It included a salad, pasta, entree and dessert. I got the Beef Carpaccio which was very good and perfect for a starter to an Italian meal. For the pasta there was only one option which was the a ravioli in a white cream sauce that was excellent. For our entree we had a choice of the branzino, chicken or pork chop. I went with the chicken but was able to try all 3 and not one of them was a disappointment. All 3 had their own distinct flavors and cooked perfectly. The last part of the meal, the dessert was not so great. Again we had 3 choices, the tiramisu, a chocolate cake and a flan. The best  of the 3 was the cake and the other 2 did not have much flavor nor didit really  taste good at all.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Came here for a date and spent over $30 (including tax) on two burgers. The portions and taste were not worth the price. I really liked the parmesan truffle fries ($1 extra with a burger; burger normally comes with regular fries) but the burger...Never in my life have I been so disappointed by a burger. All these hyped reviews made it seem like an experience, but I ended up being really disappointed.

They say hunger is the best spice, and the Nook burger was the first thing I'd eaten all day. But after I took one bite of it, I literally didn't want to take another. It wasn't terrible like it tasted bad. It just wasn't flavorful, or the flavors didn't really stand out. The patty seemed flavorless and it wasn't cooked to medium well like I'd specified (more like medium). The bun got soggy pretty quickly. The only thing I really tasted were the pickles and maybe the bacon jam if I concentrated hard enough. One redeeming point is that the patty wasn't lumpy in the middle, which can happen when it cooks and puffs up. 

Anyway, I ended up saving the rest of my burger and putting it in the fridge. It didn't taste any better reheated. To be honest, it tasted exactly the same-- that is, disappointing and pretty tasteless.

The atmosphere of this place is pretty great, but I wouldn't come here for the burgers."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I don't know if this is a review based on nostalgia since my parents have taken me to this restaurant since I was a kid, but hopefully this review does not come off as overly biased.

I've tried many Vietnamese restaurants in Philly and the surrounding areas and I love Nam Phuong, which is also my first recommendation if anyone asks me for a restaurant that specializes in dishes other than pho. 

For an appetizer, I would usually pick either the lotus salad or bo luc lac (country style beef cubes). Lotus salad is always on point and I would recommend it. The beef cubes are pretty good as well, however, I have gotten overcooked beef cubes at times. 

For an entree, I recommend canh chua which is the vietnamese hot and sour soup. Get this with fish and rice/noodles (whatever you prefer). Canh Chua is one of my favorite vietnamese dishes at home and Nam Phuong makes it pretty good.

I've only had pho here a few times since I'd rather order dishes that you'd probably won't find in the more common vietnamese cafe establishments. From what I remember, the pho is good but I prefer a broth that's more clear/transparent. Another reason I do not get pho is that Nam Phoung is best when served family style so I would order to share with whoever is with me.

Overall: Great food. Good service. Good location and relatively easy."

Now don't get me wrong, I don't hate children.  I just lose my patience with parents who don't take the time to teach their little ones how to behave when they're in public.  I know some would recommend coming here later.  Well how about parents either taking control over their kids, getting a sitter, or going to Chuck E Cheese or some other family oriented restaurant?  When you dine out, you're not just paying for food and drink, it's the ambience as well.  I didn't sign up for a romper room.  This place serves alcohol...unless they need a drink to put up with the whining and screaming, I don't think this is the type of environment for tots.  Okay, now that's out of my system...let's get down to business.  The menu isn't vast, but the food is satisfying.  The service can be hit or miss (the servers are probably too busy trying to avoid dropping piles of plates on children running between their legs).  The noise level gets a little loud so it's not a spot for an intimate conversation.  If your a parent or a lover of naughty kids, here's your haven.  For everyone else, look elsewhere."

Luckily they had food runners so I proceeded to order a Stroganoff Burger (with lettuce and tomato that you have to pay for), sweet potato fries and a corn and black bean cup. Everything was cold. The burger was supposed to have caramelized onions on it - it didn't and the fries were cold and mushy. The corn and black bean cup was fine. It's hard to screw stuff up that comes out of a can.

Horrible service, cold food and people who work here need to know how to provide attentive service and not just pass by and half ass say ""you good.

The shrimp were cooked to perfection, which was a nice touch. The grits were also perfectly cooked. The only negative was the amount of meat on the dish. I think the portion was a bit small for the price. I think it could use a little more seasoning, but overall, it was a decent meal.

Service was friendly and prompt. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal in downtown St. Pete.I can't say enough about the food here. I've been to a few different restaurants in St. Louis, and I've had a few different cocktails here. The drinks here are really good, and I've never had a bad drink here.

The food is just okay. I've had some pretty tasty things here, but nothing that I'll order again.

The service is pretty slow. I've had to wait a bit for food, but I've never been in a hurry. And the food is always good."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"For dinner, I ordered asparagus as one of my sides. It tasted fine - just okay, not great - but was literally $1+ for each stalk of asparagus. I get that it's a fine dining establishment, but damn!

Cheesecake was great, as always. Even though the slices are $7-$8 each, it's a nice treat once in a while.

The menu is insanely big, so everyone - even vegetarians - can find something they like.

The service is hit or miss. They have never been overly friendly, but I haven't had awful service, either. One thing that bugged me about this last visit was that they serve espresso, but literally 5 staff members looked at me like I was speaking another language when I asked if they could make me an iced mocha.

It's an iced mocha, it's not that hard. So, I proceeded to try and tell the girl how to pull a shot - she did it wrong, but whatever - and then had to walk her through the process of ... okay put ice in the cup... now milk.. no, more milk than that... yes.. okay now stir the chocolate and the espresso together... yeah... now pour it over the milk... therrrre ya go. Thank you. 

The iced mocha ended up being alright. Not great but it's better than Starbucks or McDonalds. 

P.S. Seriously, train your people on espresso. If I'm paying $6 for a drink, it needs to be good."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The food is really good and you'd be hard pressed to find similar quality without paying a lot more. That being said I took off two stars because of how inconsistent it is. Some days I finish my six bowl and couldn't eat another bite, other days I feel like I could eat two of them. Portion sizes are definitely not consistent.

Seems like there have been a lot of new employees recently. Not sure if a bunch of them quit or were fired or what but the new ones don't really seem to have any idea what they're doing. Most recently they ran out of two types of protein at the same time, during dinner rush, on a weekend. Inconvenient, but I understand it can happen from time to time. I asked the guy serving them how long it might be before they're ready and he said ""it'll be a while."" Oookaayyyyy...

Anyway I ended up asking to speak to the manager (yeah I'm one of those) just to let them know what was going on about the food shortage. Turns out the manager on duty was the same person wiping down tables outside when I walked in. Seems to me that the manager would be inside making sure there is food to feed the customers and delegating table cleanup to one of the other employees. But what do I know, I just eat here.

Please bring back buffalo chicken asap"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We recently visited Catch 23 and had the pleasure of trying the shrimp and grits. Both were fantastic. The shrimp were seasoned perfectly, and the grits were tasty. The gumbo was just as good as the gumbo I had last time. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and it was as good as the one I had last time. If you haven't tried the gumbo, you will! I highly recommend it! The service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. My only complaint is that the food took a while to come out. I had a chicken dish, and it was definitely overcooked. However, the chicken was very tasty. I'll be back for sure!This place is my favorite pizza place in the city. I've had a few pizza's and some pizza's and they have the best crust ever. I've had the spaghetti and meatballs and the cheesesteak.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Pretty disappointing experience. The atmosphere was a little too loud. I will not be going back.The best Mexican food in the area. The food is always fresh and tasty. The staff is always friendly and attentive. It's a little pricey for what you get but worth it.Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this is by far the best. The food is very authentic and it is always clean. The prices are very reasonable. The prices are comparable to other Mexican restaurants in the area. I highly recommend this restaurant.I was looking for a lunch spot in the area and was very disappointed. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was very bland. The chicken tasted like it was frozen. My husband ordered the beef samosas and it was very dry. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was not very good. I was expecting more of a spicy flavor.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The last time my husband and I were here was six years ago.  I remember it being more lively and fun at the piano bar back then.  Maybe it's because of the songs that were requested.  A lot of the songs requested this time did not get the audience involved but we did enjoy listening to the two ladies playing the pianos and singing.  When we walked in to the Piano Bar we went straight to the bar to order our drinks.  While my husband waited for the drinks I went to get us a table.  There were plenty of seats available although it's very crammed with all of the chairs...I'm surprised this doesn't break any maximum occupancy or fire laws.  Shortly after I was seated a male server stopped by and asked if I needed a drink.  When I told him I already had one coming he was a bit rude and just walked away.  Later I realized that many people were being brought to the tables by the servers, but I guess you can also seat yourself.  It wasn't clear to me if we should have waited to be seated.  If it's your first time in New Orleans you'll want to check out Pat O'Brien's and mark it off your list, but I don't feel like this is a must go place for me if/when I return."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"If I could just order a giant tray (TRAY, not pie, I'm from Scranton) of the Farmhouse Flatbread pizza, I would.  Buttery with apples, bacon, and cheddar, it's to-die-for.  Really, that's the only reason it has 4 stars.  Without the pizza, it would be 3. 

Meal was still decent, though.  Arugula salad with goat cheese and candied pecans and vinaigrette was great, cocktails are always made fresh (cucumber, gin, cracked pepper drink reminded me of summer).  I can't remember what  my boyfriend got, I think some type of steak and asparagus dish and it was cooked perfect, just kind of lacked in seasoning.  I got an open faced bison burger with a yogurt sauce drizzled over it.  It came with roasted potatoes in a tomato sauce and green beans.  Very homey and stick-to-your-ribs kind of dish, though it didn't all seem to go together in taste for me.

The bison was awesome and if I could have had just the meat and yogurt sauce with a different type of vegetable and no potatoes on the side, that would have been just fine.

Even though I couldn't move after the baseball-sized bison meatball, I still ordered a delicious mixed fruit crumble for dessert, perfect for the season.

Overall, I get the whole yuppie ""locally grown, organic, free range"" hype and the food was all very solid, but I'm not entirely sure it's worth the price."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We went in to try something new. Our food was pretty good but we ordered a chimichanga and it had cheese wiz covering it.  Because of this, what was supposed to be a crispy tortilla was like mush.  We also did not care for the salsa, bit that could be a matter of taste. 
The number one thing that gets my goat is our water! Most of us in the party ordered water.  We asked for water refills and they brought out a decorative bottle with a cork.  We thought the was a nice touch instead of a pitcher.  A bit later, we drank this bottle and asked for another water refill.  We got another bottle. We got to pay the check and my dad says we had been charged $3.95 for each bottle of water!  Seriously?!?  It was only tap water!  The cork on the bottle was not sealed to make us think it was anything else.  Wow!  Well, we inquire about this, and they insist this did not happen.  (We were a party of six so there were many things on the bill).  We left, drove two hours back home and look at the receipt again, and yep, there it was!  We will never go back here for the fact they treat their customers this way.  If you go, be careful when ordering water."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The state slogan for Louisiana, for those who don't know, is Sportsmens Paradise, a little counter-intuitive, but what isn't around here.  If your idea of a sport is one that requires nothing but sitting around and kibitzing and putting unhealthy things in your body, nothing could be more accurate, though, as we are a paradise for that.

The donuts are tastee, you cant have a name like Tastee donuts if they weren't. The coffee is typical donut shop coffee, the fritters are fritterlicious and for those who prefer to think of themselves as culinary explorers, let them nuke up a few castle burgers for you...our local generic version of White Castle, and as delicious and mysterious as the originals.

What makes the place stand out though is that its still an old style donut shop, with donut shop stools and a donut shop counter. If there is anything more pure America than that, I cant think of it. Its a friendly place, locals lingering while waiting to show up late for jobs they wont work very hard at when they arrive. Easy to talk to whoever is there.

Worth making a special trip out for if your visiting the city? Maybe not, but if you are taking a nice bike ride up Esplanade to City Park, stop in, get a sugar high, and a feeling for just how nice it is to live in a place where the feeling of friendliness is standard."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This review is 100% for the food and the service. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was pretty bad, but that is the only reason I give 4 stars. I came here on a Tuesday night and it was about 15:30. I ordered the churros and they were just ok. I also ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was just ok. The chicken was not seasoned well and the rice was not all that good. I will not come back here again. I would recommend trying the food, but not the service. I would probably stick to the food from here instead.This place is amazing! They have a wide variety of sandwiches and salads. The cheese was a bit on the dry side, but the sandwich was awesome.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I came here with my dining companion for Valentine's Day. The atmosphere was amazing -- they set up heart-shaped balloons and really V-Day'd it up for the occasion. The best part is that we couldn't make it out until Saturday and all the decorations were still up! 

The place is not really good for huge groups of more than 8. It's super quaint. I'd make a reservation just to be safe. The service was okay, but the owner was super sweet and made sure we were having a good experience -- which I really appreciate. 

As for the food, maybe it's because I didn't have wine, maybe it's because I'm not a connoisseur of real italian food, but I found it subpar. 

We ordered lobster ravioli for our appetizer and that just was not very good. The lobster just wasn't buttery enough to have much flavor. 

For my main dish, I ordered a creamy pasta. I'm usually a fan of creamy pasta and sun-dried tomatoes and prosciutto, but my dish was a little too creamy without much flavor. It was way too heavy, imo. My dining companion enjoyed his mussels, however. So maybe I just made a bad choice with creamy pasta?

For desert, we got the ricotta cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. The ricotta cheesecake tasted a little like tres leches, like soggy cheesecake, and I was not a fan. The red velvet was okay, not phenomenal.

Overall, my experience was ""a-ok""."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Stopped by this place on the recommendation of one of my friends with the expectation of long lines but delicious foods. I wanted to go on Friday morning when I knew there wouldn't be too bad of a line, but we wound up going on Saturday morning. We got there right before 8 am and we were part of the first group waiting outside the door. It wasn't too long of a line - probably about 20-25 minutes before we were seated. 

We ordered once we were seated and our food came out relatively quickly. I ordered the silver dollar pancakes since I know that I can't eat 5 huge pancakes on my own (otherwise the blueberry pancakes would've been on my plate). I also got the hash browns since they were what brought us here. The pancakes were pretty good - fluffy and cooked well. The syrup was light and thin, which just meant that I had to use less. It was delicious as well, and since it comes out warm I was a happy person. 

The hash browns, though - those were good. Crispy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside. I would definitely get these again if I was in a mood for hash browns. 

Overall, I was very happy with the total experience. I would definitely bring my friends back, but I'm not sure if I would brave the lines in less than ideal weather."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The best breakfast in Reno hands down no question. Proportions perfect, NOT greasy at ALL, service was also good.  The potatoes are almost like german pancake-ish so like mashed grill cooked and lightly browned on either side. So nice to have breakfast potatoes that don't make your heart want to stop. The Canadian bacon was so lean it wasn't even funny, absolutely fantastic meat like Boar's Head brand and not typical Cisco restaurant garbage. My wife and I have tried nearly every breakfast restaurant in Reno and nothing even comes close to this place, they have two new fans for life. We left feeling refreshed and satisfied instead of leaving feeling sluggish and bloated like at a normal breakfast place. And the best part is we only spent $27 on two breakfasts and a coffee. 

And to the spoiled brats giving this place one star because you had to wait around to be seated, please do the World a favor and delete your yelp accounts. We didn't try this place earlier because of people like you driving the star rating down because you had to wait to be seated and because no one came up and gave you a free mimosa while you waited. It's arrogant narcissistic clowns like you that screw up the rating of a place like this that should be SIX STARS food-wise. You had to wait around....? Yea, at good restaurants this is usually the case. Get real..."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I have been starting to fall back in love with Marriott's Renaissance thanks to their re-branding. While it takes awhile for all of the hotels in a given brand to update, I was happy to see that the Nashville Hotel has finally been updated. That being said, I really wouldn't  categorize this Renaissance like others in the brand as it is more of a convention hotel. 

Pros:

+Location- Attached to the convention center if you happen to be attending a convention, and it is conveniently located within 2 blocks of Broadway

+Starbucks- Some times you just need caffeine in the morning to function and luckily there happens to be one in the lobby

+Staff- They seemed really friendly and nice, especially the doorman and concierge. They were able to provide excellent dining and activity suggestions.

+Beds- they were extremely comfortable

 

Cons:

-Location- Outside of Broadway, you needed to drive to other areas of the city, i.e. Westend, East Nashville/Five Points, the Gulch, etc.

-Noise - On the weekends, this hotel attracts a lot of bachelorette parties and during the week, you can get some louder guests as well. The walls are paper thin like others have mentioned and this can get annoying. 

-Lobby/public space areas- There really doesn't seemed to be smaller than some of the other ones I've stayed at in which you could gather to work with coworkers if need be. 

-Elevators- They took awhile to call and go up or down to your selected floor"

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food at Dawson's is fantastic! My husband and I have been there many times.  It is a great place to go to have a variety of choices - you can't go wrong with anything.  

I gave this restaurant 3 stars due to the service.  Service and management.  Out of the many times we've been there, we've only had good service a handful of times.  

Here are a few examples..

1.  When Dawson's gets busy, they can't handle it so they stop serving carry out.

2.  One time I picked up carry out and they never returned my debit card.  I realized when I got home and then called and they swore up and down they didn't have it.  I then went back to the restaurant...they claimed they looked for it.  The next day they called and said they had the card.  I went to pick it up and they did not give any sort of apology whatsoever. That is very bad customer service.

3.  One time we were given the wrong pasta dish. The waitress just said sorry.  We were hungry so we didn't want to switch it out so we just ate it.  The meal was not discounted or comped.  Any other restaurant that I have ever been to would have apologized and comped the meal. 

So all that being said, go for the food but don't expect good service."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was craving Chinese food for lunch on my birthday, so we checked out what was in the area. We found Hunan because of the other great reviews, and they definitely delivered on those! The service was quick and not a mistake was made. The food came out in courses, salad, egg rolls, then main meals. The salad was not your typical Chinese food restaurant salad - it actually had dark greens! And the dressing was great. The egg rolls were incredibly good, with small full shrimp, and a savory pork sausage filling along with the veggies. They came out piping hot, so we had to wait a bit to eat them, but it was very worth it. 

The main dishes came out pretty quickly - my boyfriend and I got beef dishes, and we were impressed by them both. He got the beef and broccoli and I got the orange beef, which I would recommend 100 times over. It wasn't terribly spicy, the beef was tender, and there was a great flavor to the whole dish. Bonus: you can get brown rice! And the orange beef came with freshly steamed broccoli! All in all, a great lunch. I'd love to go back for dinner, maybe try some of their appetizers, definitely get another egg roll! And I can't forget the lovely chocolate dipped fortune cookie that cause me to ask, ""Why doesn't EVERYONE dip their fortune cookies in chocolate?"" It's a valid question."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Nearly a year ago I checked in at Dade City Wild Things on Facebook (I live in Southern California) and within seconds a friend texted me and told me I had to try On Q before leaving town. He went to college nearly two decades ago at St Leos and said On Q was one of the better BBQ spots (and the best place to eat in this area). We took his advice. 

On Q does impress. In a region where awesome BBQ doesn't grow on trees this place stands out. It's a small, affordable spot that takes bride in offering good, consistent BBQ and some wild dishes, like turkey ribs. The turkey ribs are true turkey ribs and the turkey slides off the bone, literally. It's an odd dish that I haven't found anywhere else in the country that has this item, and I've literally been to 100s of BBQ spots across the country. Try it. Its a unique item that some will love. Others are too freaked out to try it. 

The rest of their BBQ is pretty darn good, and we sampled just about all of it. The only drawback is the pulled chicken is too dry. Otherwise, the pulled pork and beef brisket is cooked well and packs flavor. The sides rival the dishes, too. This is a pure BBQ and a secret spot, per say. Many of the locals who worked at Dade City Wild Things didn't know about it!"

Bar tender makes the friend hanging out a drink but not the guy who came in with 12 other people.The blonde (Kris) behind the bar was to busy attending to her girlfriend and drinking the profits to notice. She was pretty close to keeping up with us as far as drinking goes. So our buddy went and got a drink from the other bar next to the pool table. Orders a drink and this bar tender says single or double? When ordering a drink wouldn't you say double if you wanted double? To the dude in the corner saying ""dude it's Saturday night"" after buddy orders a single.....have a great walk home! So there was a tab for all 12 people except guess who? Yup!! The same guy!! Everyone else on one tab and buddy who she finally serves has a tab. If he walks in and talks to the 12 others all night long then he is probably with the others. To the owner of that place do yourself a favor and send in multiple secret guests of different height, age, weight, color, gender or whatever just make sure their different and see how your people react.

I also like that the seating is limited.  The seating is limited on the inside and the tables are spaced apart.  It is very convenient for people that want to try something new.  The decor is modern and very modern.  I usually don't like to go into a restaurant with a very loud music, but the service is always great.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"First time on a cruise and it was an experience. I will say that the food was pretty good. The service was good. The food came out quick and tasty. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the wine was on the cold side. I would recommend coming here if you are looking for a quick and tasty lunch.I have never had a bad experience here. They have a great menu with lots of different items to choose from. I always get the shrimp dumplings with garlic butter and a salad. The food is always very fresh. I recommend this place to everyone.Just found this place on yelp and it was not only good but delicious! The location is great and the food was amazing. I had the shrimp tacos which were very good. My husband had the chicken burrito which was very good. I had the buffalo chicken wings and they were amazing! They were served with a side of fries and a side of salsa. We will definitely be back! The service was good and we had a great time!Great place for a quick bite! The food is great! We had the crab cakes, the shrimp po boy and the scallops. The po boy was good but the"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"So my husband and I have been to Angry Crab in Tempe a few times and we really enjoyed it. We were excited about about the location here in Tucson. My husband and I are both from Louisiana so I was nice to have lil taste of home near by.  My husband went about a month prior and he had catfish and gumbo. His seafood was good but he warned me of the gumbo tasted nothing like one in Tempe. So my note is here.... lacking consistency. So we went back last week and was told the gumbo was not the same as the one in Tempe before I ordered. Hopefully they will get this together soon. 

So for good news... the boiled seafood was good as usually. I got some shrimp (trifecta, mild heat, with some Cajun seasoning on the side to dip my shrimp)... I like spicy but I like to control my destiny.  
I like the French fries!! They are really good.

My husband deviated from his norm (fried catfish) and opted for BBQ. I will just say that he willl never be ordering BBQ from here again. He felt that is was lacking seasoning... if you like it bland this might be BBQ for you. His pulled pork was dry. Our waitress was nice and took the pork off the bill   husband didn't touch it.

Our service was really good. Our kept our drinks full and provided the needed condiments"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Someone told my husband about this place and insisted we try it out. I usually cannot find much to eat at places like this, being a picky vegetarian. However, he really wanted to go. The first time we went, they were closed due to an electricity outage. The next time we went they had the food closed because it was a Sunday and the food closes down early. Finally, time 3, we went and ordered our food. They took my husbands order first and gave him his food then took mine. He went to the register and let them know my food wasn't out, but he wanted to pay for both. When mine came out we were looking for a drink and the people working there were staring at us like we were stealing. I became anxious wondering what was going on. At the register, as we paid for my drink the person working accused us of getting dessert and not paying. My husband let them know we did not order dessert and that he asked to pay for my mozzarella sticks when he paid for his meal. They appeared very frustrated and accused my husband of trying to get away without paying. We paid and left. There was nowhere to sit in this place so we had to drive home. The cheese sticks were bland and dry with no marinara sauce and his cuban he described as slimy. I definitely will not visit here again."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Delicious! Five stars cause the food is amazing. We ordered the shrimp and grits, the crawfish and shrimp mac and cheese, the mussels and the shrimp and grits. The crawfish and shrimp mac and cheese was amazing. The mussels were very good as well. The grits were a little tough to eat and I would not recommend the crawfish and shrimp mac and cheese. My husband had the pork chop and it was very good. The prices are very reasonable for what you get. My only complaint is that the service was lacking. We ordered a coffee and tea and it took about 10 minutes for the coffee to come out. Overall, great experience!I stopped in here for lunch and was immediately impressed by the delicious menu and the service. My sister and I had a great time and enjoyed ourselves. My only complaint is that we were a little too full for our lunch, but that was not a big deal. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something different than the usual Chinese food in the area.Great local place to grab a quick bite to eat! My son and I were hungry and the service was great. I loved it! They have some great draft beers on"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"VACATION WELL EARNED!!!!   We will be back!!!!  

Thanks for the great experience.I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little tough to chew and it was very chewy. I think the chorizo was just a little too salty. 

I will be back.This is a great place for lunch or dinner. The service is great, the food is delicious, and the prices are very reasonable. The portions are generous, and the food is not too spicy. We ordered a side of tortilla chips and they were delicious. I ordered the cauliflower tacos which were good, but a little dry. My husband had the veggie tacos, which he enjoyed. We also ordered the guacamole and the pork tacos. The guacamole was delicious, the pork taco was very flavorful and the guacamole was just right. The tacos were large and the portions were generous. The tacos were very filling, and the portion sizes were very generous. I would recommend this place if you"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"As your wait person will tell you, they make everything (salad dressings, condiments, etc.) from scratch here and they use local or community farms for their produce. Their menu changes daily based on what they have. They had a whole pig the day we were there so a pork tenderloin sandwich was on the menu.

The have a very nice patio area that is set back from the street. They also have a parking lot across the street. 

I am not a big burger person, but I do order them when I know they are made with really good meat. Bluebeard's are made with beef and lamb and are cooked so that they are pink in the middle. The Royale burger has tomato, pickle, garlic aioli, coarse mustard, and bacon. It was delicious, juicy, messy to eat, and maybe the best burger that I've ever had. I thought about it all afternoon. My dining companion had the pork tenderloin and said it was very good. Two sandwiches, diet coke, and iced tea came to $35 before tip for lunch.

Service was friendly, informative, and attentive, but the kitchen was slow. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since our order went in right behind the order of a large group. If this is their typical lunch speed, it would be a pinch to eat here on an hour lunch break. In spite of the slow kitchen, I'm still giving them 5 stars because my burger was THAT good."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"It has been quite a few years from my first review and this restaurant has changed hands since then...therefore, time to update.  I am shocked to see the 3.5 star overall review.  This is much much better and deserving of at least a 4.5 star for a restaurant in this category.  Believe me, I am picky, and I travel a great deal therefore I have a lot to compare it to.  This is our local ""go to"" Asian fusion restaurant.  We stop in often.  We have tried many dishes and everything has been delicious, dependable, generous portions and served in a timely manner.  Servers definitely want to please.  My favorite dish is the sweet and sour shrimp.  I highly recommend that.  Sushi is also fresh and excellent.  It is a cute, very clean, comfortable and modern style restaurant.  Has a small sushi bar in the back.  It is not a large restaurant but we have never had to wait for a table.  The small strip mall is unimpressive.  We try not to do take out as the food is always more crisp and better in the restaurant but that could also be bc we are about a 15 min drive.  It is a great value as prices are in line with the portions.  Even the combo dishes are large enough to share. Don't forget to BYOB!!  Overall...I highly recommend."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is the only fair comparison to the other chain restaurants I have been to in the area. The food is not the best I have had and the service is not the best. I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to enjoy it with a friend. I will say that the food was pretty good. I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and the ginger chicken wrap. I would definitely order the chicken shawarma sandwich again. The interior of this place was really cool. I really liked the decor. It's kind of like a breakfast place but I like it more. I also really liked the fact that they have a bar. I will definitely be coming back!This is a very cool place with good food. I've been coming here for years. The service is pretty good and the food is always good. My favorite is the shrimp and grits. They have a lot of different sauces and you can't go wrong with anything. The prices are very reasonable, I always get the seafood gumbo, which is usually pretty good. They have some pretty good drinks too."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Ordered through Grubhub, so can't comment on the food, but I will say that the food was pretty good.  The burrito was a bit small, but we got the same thing and it was good.  It was a little pricey for what it is, but it was good.  We will definitely come back to try the other things on the menu.  I've heard great things about the tacos, so I'll try it out.I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries. I like their chicken wings, but it's kind of bland. It's not like I'm eating it at a fancy place. I like their soups. They have a lot of variety. I also love their home fries. I don't like their fries. I like their home fries, but their home fries are just so salty I don't like them. I really like their sweet potato fries. They have a lot of variety. I usually order the sweet potato fries and it's always hot and full of flavor. The fried chicken is also very good, I've never had anything that isn't."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went here last Thursday (party of 2) and were seated right away. Our waitress was extremely helpful and just the right amount of attentive--We were able to place our orders and get served in a timely fashion without being hovered over. They have a really funky atmosphere, somewhere between fancy and gaudy, but I like it (big plus: gaudy chairs=super comfy). They have plenty of seating and space, so you don't end up crowded.

The portion sizes here are pretty big, way too much for one person, but not family style like Palazzio. I got the ravioli sampler. The cheese ravioli with marinara was pretty average, I don't really care for sausage, so the ravioli with that in it wasn't my favorite, either. The pumpkin ravioli was good at first, but it became a little overwhelming flavor-wise after a few bites, so I definitely wouldn't recommend a full serving. The gorgonzola ravioli was on the better side of average. The only ravioli that was extremely tasty was the mushroom ravioli, it was subtle, not too mushroom-y, with just a touch of sweetness. I don't remember what my friend ordered, but that was really good, it was something with red onions, bacon, chicken, and garlic-cream sauce. Blackberry italian soda was REALLY good.

Overall, I prefer Palazzio--Pascucci isn't bad, but the flavor is slightly superior and the prices are slightly more reasonable at Palazzio. However, if you don't want to wait a good chunk of time for your food, go for Pascucci."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I have been going to Kabob House on a semi-regular basis over the past year and I am happy to say that i like the place even more than I did when they opened.

The Rib Kabob is my favorite plate--they grill the lamb to perfection (cliche, but true) and the cilantro chatni is a superb sauce for the already well-seasoned lamb.

The Sambosas are fried, golden packets of delightful potato, lentils, and ground beef/lamb.  These have been around culturally since the 10th century, and for good reason.

The Ashe soup is an appetizer, but in reality an entire meal.  This soup is exotically spiced, yet still comfort food.  It works particularly well as hangover-recovery food.

The service is perfectly marvelous.  Once, we had an out-of-town visitor whom we absolutely HAD to take to Kabob House.  We got back from traveling just before the restaurant closed, yet with ten minutes left in their business day, they let us in and treated us as honored guests.  I got to sit in the low couches and devour late-night lamb and sambosas chased with Baltica beer.  Our guest was knocked out by the quality of the food and the hospitality.  Don't worry--we tipped accordingly.

If you live in west Boise (or elsewhere) and you are thinking of going to the new Jack in the Box, Five Guys, or Firehouse subs change your destination and try Kabob House.  You will not regret it, though those other places will."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I found this place through yelp and it was pretty good. The waitress was nice and we sat down.  The food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside tables were dirty. I would come back to try the food.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised to see the menu and live music.  I had the ham and cheese soup and it was delicious!  The service was very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was very clean and had a nice vibe.  We will definitely be back!A must try if you're in the area. We were in town visiting and found this place and we couldn't pass up the chance to eat here. I had the veggie pizza with the fries and the veggie salad with the tomato sauce. Both were good. I had the mushroom pizza with the coleslaw and I could tell it was homemade. I was expecting a bit more of a pizza than I got in my house. The staff was friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend it.Had lunch here and I loved it.  The service was excellent and the food was very good
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Went there this morning with a group of friends and it was a nice place to sit and eat. We had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked to order and the chorizo was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the chicken burrito with no onions. He liked it and I liked mine. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The burrito was very filling and filling. The burrito was filling and flavorful. The chorizo was very tasty. It was very crispy. I liked the fact that it was not just a big burrito, but a burrito that was loaded with rice and beans. We were very pleased with our meal. The chorizo was very good and not too greasy. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner.We have been here several times over the years. 

We have always enjoyed the food, service, and service. 

The last two times we went, the waitress forgot about us for about 10 minutes, and then another waitress came over to ask if we were okay, and we were. 

We have not been to this location many times, but have never had a bad experience"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This is an interesting concept - a Vietnamese/Japanese restaurant. They offer all things that you would typically find in either food genre. Because of this, the menu is large and can be overwhelming.  A few of us stopped here after watching a movie. A couple of my friends had been here before and said that this place serves really good pho and the portions are huge. 
My friends ordered a couple sushi cones, the chicken pho and the teriyaki chicken bowl. I wasn't feeling like pho so I ordered the tri-color sashimi bowl - I should have ordered the pho. Not that my sashimi bowl was bad but it wasn't great. And for the price of $16.95, there were only 6 pieces of sashimi (2 salmon, 2 tuna, 2 red tuna). This was disappointing since the dishes that my friend's ordered were massive and full of good food and for a much better price. The sashimi was nothing to write home about. It was on the tougher side and the cut of it was odd. On a lighter note, the presentation was pretty and colorful with the added touch of having a small orchid to finish off the dish. The service was also good. No complaints there.
If I were to come back here again, I would stick to the pho or the teriyaki dish. I think that the idea is neat to serve both types of food, but it makes it more challenging to be excellent in both."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Last night (11/12/2016) me and two friends went to go watch the UFC fight. It took us 10 minutes to get a drink which is understandable, even after the bartender ignored us and was cutting limes. I understand because fight nights are busy. It was about 12:35 am and the bartender, Ashley, who had brown hair and was wearing an Ohio State Jersey with B. Miller on the back, asked us not once but twice within 10 minutes to pay our tab so that she could get everybody closed out before 1 am. The main even had not even happened yet! She ignored us to cut limes, yet rushed us to take our money?!?! AWFUL!!! She shouldn't be a bartender! 

I would like state that I am also a server and that I know how frustrating and annoying it is to have people after close lingering in the resteraunt when you just want to do your cashout and go home. 

HOWEVER this comes with being the server or bartender in a resteraunt, and you should know that you're not going to get out at exactly closing time. 

It is NEVER ok to rush a patron into paying, especially 25 minutes before close. I have never been so disrespected at a resteraunt and I absolutely abhor putting reviews up  ,  but I'm going out of my way this time to do it. 

I plan not coming back to Buffalo Wild Wings, and possibly taking this up with corporate."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"What a great addition to the area and the food is good. 

The only thing is that the service is a bit slow.  The server was not attentive at all and was just a little overwhelmed. 

I will be back.  I know it's not the best Thai food in the area, but I'm glad I made it to the restaurant.I love this place! This place has a nice atmosphere and they have some great specials. I got the sweet potato fries and they were delicious! The service was really nice and they were quick with the orders. We will definitely be back.I have been going here for over 10 years and it is the best Italian restaurant in town. They have the best Italian menu in town. My favorite is the gnocchi. Also the staff is very nice. I have never had a bad meal here.This place is a must visit if you're in the area. It's right on the water, but not too far from the beach. It's small, but everything is so fresh. The staff is friendly and the food is so good. The owner, Steve, is very nice and gives great recommendations for all of the dishes. The only downside is that the location"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"DO NOT STAY HERE. I WILL NEVER BE BACK. Very good food. Service is excellent. The food is amazing. The eggplant parm was tasty. The sausage and cheese with the mushrooms and the eggplant parm was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend. Great food, great service. We had the lamb gyro and it was excellent. I also had the chicken gyro with pork and it was good. The owner was very nice and it was a great experience. The menu has a lot of options for you to choose from. We had a couple of beers and some wine and they were all very good. We would definitely come back here again. I'm a huge fan of this place. I've never been disappointed. I have been coming here for years and the food is always top notch. My favorite is the chicken salad and the fries. The service is always great and the atmosphere is great. My family and I visited St. Louis and this is the best place we have been to for Chinese food. The food is always fresh and hot. My family and I will always be back. We have eaten here on several occasions and have never had a bad experience."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Our experience at Zama was disappointing. While the fish itself was quite good (great quality), we found the specialty rolls to be overpriced and lacking flavor. We started with the seaweed salad with octopus, which was only OK. The seaweed was chewier than usual and the octopus had absolutely no flavor. Probably would've been happier if we had ordered sans octopus. Our favorites of the night were the toro and scallion and eel and avocado rolls, which were also the least expensive. The surfer roll (which came out fried, without any indication on the menu) was OK, but didn't have much flavor. And we explicitly said we didn't want anything tempura, so to find our roll fried was quite a bummer. The lobster wasabi roll was OK, but had no flavor of wasabi! The lobster salad on top was mayo-heavy as well. All the rolls had 6 pieces, and I could've easily had another roll or 2.

The service was very good (though we did have to ask for water refills) - we sat in the bar area so the bartender was our server and he did a very good job.

Again, the fish itself was delicious and excellent quality. But it just wasn't worth the price for us. Maybe we would've been happier if we had just ordered simpler rolls that highlighted the fish quality, but we thought Zama was known for specialty rolls. Seaweed salad with octopus, 4 rolls, and 2 drinks was $90. And I definitely didn't leave full."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"There is a reason why I avoided this place all these years, almost 15 to be exact, but I eased up on my inhibitions because my friend Chris wanted to go. I tried to convince him that better seafood could be had at a steakhouse, but he kept telling me that this place would ""pleasantly surprise me."" ""I heard their seafood is still frozen, even their lobsters,"" I said, but when we arrived he assured me they were not, pointing to the fishtanks full of live lobsters. Unfortunately, what we ate did not include these beautiful beasts all snuggled up against one another. No, no, these lobsters were reserved for those who could pay for them by the pound just like other more reputable restaurants that also charge by the pound but masterfully prepare them a whole lot better. Five or ten minutes makes a big difference with seafood and this is where Red Lobster fails just like Joe's Crab Shack. Everything is cooked a bit too long so it all tastes overcooked and rubbery. My Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops was abomination. It was sustenance and nothing more. I could get better seafood at a diner.I've been to Red Lobster twice before. The first time I got a whole lobster that was overcooked and rubbery. The second time I got the dish with three preparations of shrimp. Both times left me feeling cheated of my money. Three strikes and you're out is the old adage. I won't be back."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I'm excited! Why? Because Oro Valley has the best food in Tucson. 

The food is always delicious and the service is always great. 

I think this place is going to be a regular stop for me. I will most likely be going back to Oro Valley once I'm back in town.The food is good, but the service is not. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken sandwich. It's all good. But it's not worth the money. The sandwiches are really, really good. I think I'll give this place another try.A must try if you're in the area. We were in town for work and were looking for a place to eat. It was close to the airport and we had a great time. We went on a Saturday night and were seated right away. We were greeted by our waiter, who was very friendly and attentive. 

We ordered the spicy tuna roll, the spicy tuna and the spicy tuna. The spicy tuna was very spicy and the tuna was well seasoned. The spicy tuna was very good. The spicy tuna was the best part of the dish. The spicy tuna was not spicy at all but was very salty"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"My family are no strangers to this place. We've been here a few times and each time we've had a very enjoyable experience. We have ordered the Tuna melt, the Shrimp and Grits, and the Crab Rangoon. All very good. If you have the time to spare, this is the place to go. The service is always excellent and the food is delicious. The only downside is that there is a small parking lot with a long line so if you want to park, be prepared to wait. You can find a spot at the bar which is a great option. 

I have had some of their dishes and have not had a bad experience. I highly recommend the fish, the crab Rangoon, and the crab Rangoon. 

I can't wait to come back and try some more of their other dishes.Very cute little cafe. I got a strawberry milkshake and a cup of coffee. Both were delicious! The espresso was fresh and sweet. The coffee was hot and smooth. The strawberries and blueberry milkshake was very good. The coffee was warm and creamy. Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast!This is a great place to have a nice lunch,"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This was my first pick of sushi in the neighborhood for a while until now. I've gone a handful of times since COVID and the wait staff has always been super fast and attentive. Last night we went to dinner, sat down, placed our order and were chatting when the manager came to 'check' on us. 
He asked how we were doing and stood there awkwardly for a second when finally said he had ""already reserved this table (which the waitress sat us at) for another party and we'd have to move.."" we asked to what table and he looked around and said ""ummmmmm..."" it was pretty awkward for a minute then he said to follow him. 
We had to GRAB ALL OF OUR OWN DISHES AND DRINKS, and walked through the busy restaurant while the rest of the people dining stared. We walked clear across the restaurant and then he abruptly turned around, bumping into me and spilling soy sauce all over my food and the ground. He finally sat us down, and ran off. We had to re-order all of our food because we now had a new waiter, who was great and brought our food out quickly, but the manager never apologized, checked on us again, offered a free drink, or even a little discount or something for the hassle and humiliation of that whole situation. I hope 2 The Joint can make this right, otherwise I'll return to Tokyo Sushi, a great alternative right down the street."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Both times I was here, once lunch and once dinner, the food and service were excellent. The speed at lunch was super fast, but not rushed. Our dinner service was a hair slower, but still reasonable and the place was WALL TO WALL PACKED. we did have a 15 minute wait and you do have to practically buy a parking spot on a Friday night...Now food: I had Der Rueben both times. This is the only place I will eat a rueben from. Awesome. I love the pickles, they are half sours for those that know their pickles. I also had some of my companions food. The Jaeger Schnitzel was great. Tender and moist. The Hunter gravy was good, huge hunks of mushroom! :)  The Pierogies were excellent. Slightly small serving on my opinion (5? I think) but the sauce was a pleasant surprise. The Matterhorn sandwich was a huge hit with my husband. He had way too much fun sampling all the mustard choices on the table. Finally, the Potato Pancakes were OUT OF THIS WORLD! I am a dedicated sour cream girl, but I tried them with the applesauce they come with (on addition to sour cream) and I loved them both ways. Stand alone they were great as well. Both trips were very reasonable in price, and I WILL be returning often, just not on a Friday night if I can help it. It's just too busy for my taste. Also, Jason was our server, Kudos Jason!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Delco's Original Steak & Hoagies (Cheddar Steak and Grits) is the best one. I had the Chicken, Steak & Grits. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the Grits were perfect. The best part was the fries. The fries were crispy and crispy and the chicken was juicy and tender. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the Grits were great. The Grits were seasoned perfectly and the chicken was well seasoned. The sauce was spicy and the chicken was very crispy. I'm not a fan of the prices but the food was good.

We have tried several different food trucks, all of which are great.  The food is always good, and the service is always friendly.  The best thing about this place is that they have a parking lot in front of the truck and a few parking spots at the back.  They have a lot of options, but I recommend getting there early, because the line can get crazy quick.  I've had a few different burgers here, and the ones I've tried have been great.  The fries are pretty good, too.  I have had some of the salads here, and they are really good.  The beer selection is good.  The atmosphere is always nice and they have a good live band.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Disappointed by this place. I travel a lot and restaurants with 4 stars are usually pretty solid. This place is NOT 4 stars. First, there is a hand written sign on the door saying Please Do Not Seat Yourself. That's fine, but there is no host station. When I entered here were 7 people lingering waiting for someone to help. Wait staff kept walking through without making eye contact. Once I'd had enough waiting, I went to the sushi bar and asked if I could sit there, and was told I could. I placed my order with the sushi chef and it seems like I was served much more quickly than those seated at tables, so that was a bonus. I ordered a spicy tuna roll, an eel and avocado roll, and a white tiger roll. I've never had a spicy tuna roll with pickled radish in it, so thought I'd try it. I get what they are trying to do by adding some texture, but it didn't work for me.  The eel and avocado roll was fine, not really noteworthy either way. I was most excited about the white tiger roll, but it was just a hot mess. It was almost soupy inside, very strange texture. Finally, the phone rang at least 20 times when I was sitting at the sushi bar and nobody ever answered it. It just kept going to an old school answering machine.  I have to believe there are better sushi experiences in St Louis."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Nashville!  Can't believe I'm just now getting around to reviewing it!!  AMAZING!  We've been twice now & had stellar service & food both times.

On our first visit we had the pan roasted crawfish w/ preserved lemon.  Oh WOW - so good!!  I've had crawfish before but it didn't come close to being this delicious.  Also had the crispy octopus & limas.  Freakin yum.  We had the pizza margherita too - it would have been better if we'd eaten it hot, but by the time we finished the crawfish it was all cold.  BOOO.  But not CH's fault!

Second visit we had the octopus again - fabulous as usual - and my husband tried the house cured salami.  He said it was really tasty & you could just taste the care that went into it.  Also had the pizza with lima puree - so yummy!  I guess I was expecting whole limas but it was the puree instead, and it was soooooo freaking yummy.  Would never have thought of that!

Oh yeah, and we didn't have a reservation either time we went.  The first time we sat at the chef's bar, and the second time we sat outside (only because it wasn't 100 degrees out there).  You need to make reservations a week or so in advance!  But we still had a great time. We'll keep going back again & again!"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"Do yourself a favor and go to The Wildflower. It's a lovely little spot to eat.I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo. The burrito was cooked perfectly and the chorizo was fresh. The chorizo was excellent. The chorizo was a little spicy but the flavor was good. The burrito was a little bland but it was just what I expected. I would go back.I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the red beans and rice. They have a great selection of beers on tap. I love the outdoor seating, but I wish they had a patio to sit outside. There's a lot of parking in the back.I love this place! It's very clean, with good food. I've been here twice now, both times the food was great. I've also had their shrimp and grits, and both times the food was good. The atmosphere is very nice, and they have a large outdoor patio. I would definitely recommend this place.I've been here several times now and I've enjoyed everything on the menu. 

I have tried the chicken, ribs,"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Someone dropped a menu off and asked if we wanted something else. She didn't even ask how we wanted anything. When I told her the menu, she said, ""I don't think it's in the name. "" Then she told me I had to order something else. I ended up going to the bar and got the corned beef burger which was served with a grilled onion rings and a side of fries. I couldn't finish my burger and left hungry. I'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner, but I'm looking forward to it. Good food, great service. Had the mushroom soup. We were in the mood for some mushroom and cheese soup, so I ordered the cauliflower soup. It was good, but not great. We also ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes. It was good, but not great. Our server was very friendly. I would definitely come back for more. We'll be back soon. This is my go to spot for Chinese. The food is always fresh and hot. It's always fast and I always get my food within 30-45 minutes. I've never had a bad meal."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was in town for work and although I'm from STL, I'd never been to Katie's before. Needless to say, it will probably be the last time I go to Katie's. The food was nice although the balsamic vinaigrette on the fried artichoke salad was a bit much. The service however was T.R.A.S.H. The server was polite but he pretty much ignored us the entire time. We had to do far too much to get his attention. He was falling all over himself to accomodate his other tables while barely giving us a passing glance. It was annoying and embarrassing. What could have made us so easy to ignore? Perhaps it was because we were the only 2 Black women in the ENTIRE restaurant that made the difference. I know you're probably not used to seeing Black people in lily white West County but we do exist and occasionally we like to eat pizza, pasta, and overdressed salads. I guess I should just be glad our presence didn't warrant a call to 911.
I'd hate to think that the color of my skin was the reason for such incredibly lackluster service but as a former server, I'm very cognizant of the biases that servers have and how rampant racism and sexism are in the industry. Regardless of the shitty service, I still left a tip far larger than your server deserved because I'm a good person. On positive note, the busser/ food runner was very attentive. Give him the tip I left your server."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Third time in a row that Lebus has let me down! First meal there back in April was great, but all three meals after that have been less than favorable. 

Went in October with friends twice. First time had soup and salad. The soup was cold and Winnie's wouldn't do a small side salad, so I was presented with a very large plate of greens. Didn't really resemble a salad too much, tasteless as well. Second time I went for lunch, and the Thai Salad was terrible. Again just a lump of lettuce on plate, nothing that made it stand out as Thai Salad. Tasteless and the dressing was not good either. Very disappointing. 

Went there two nights ago for dinner. Both my friend and I got a beer and a hamburger. Neither of us finished the burger, and the beer tasted watered down. My burger tasted like an overdone meatball, and was mostly bread from the overized bun. My friend's was exactly the same in taste...blah. I ordered a side of greens instead of the fries. Apparently placing a nice side salad on half the plate is too much for Lebus because next to my hamburger was a large chunk of over cooked broccoli. It was so sad that the over cooked broccoli actually tasted better than the burger. 

Winnie's looks so inviting and the menu isn't bad, but the food turns out to be a few steps below sub-par. Unfortunately, I'm done with Winnie's for a while. Taking my business elsewhere."

The pizza was cold, the cheese was okay, the sauce was okay, but it was so hard and stale. I would have gone elsewhere if I could.The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the lamb gyro and it was excellent. I also had the chicken tikka masala which was delicious. The portion size was perfect and the price was right.

I like that they are open late, which is nice.  The service is always great and the food is delicious.  

I have never been disappointed with my meal here.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich and the cheesesteak.  I've had both, and I've always enjoyed both.  The fries are always delicious.  The prices are fair for the quality and quantity of food. 

They also have a great beer selection.  I've never had a bad beer here, but I've had a few that I really liked."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I've seen Longhorn Steakhouse for almost 20 years, but I've never been to this one near University Mall.
My go to steak place was Temple Terrace Outback. However, I feel like the food quality there was gone down a bit.

Longhorn is on the surface similar to Outback. It has a dark wood look and similar cuts of steak.(They have the bloomin' onion renamed to Texas Tonion.)

Service: Great. I've been 2 times in the last 6 months. Both servers were affable and good at bringing out the food quickly.

Food: Im a creature of habit. I usually get a 16 oz prime rib with mashed potatoes. It was juicy, and cooked to medium like I requested. Probably not the best steak of all time, but for the price Its good enough.

Misc: It is a small thing, but I love that when you ask for A1 sauce here, they bring you a whole bottle. I dont know if its Outback policy now, but they just bring you a ramekin with sauce and you have to pester them to bring more. Is it a cost-saving feature? Lame. A1 sauce doesn't have gold or platinum in it last time I checked.
For prime rib , in addition to au jus, they have a nice creamy sauce that sort of tastes like horseradish-based sauce. 

Negatives: I ordered a Mango Margarita, but it was pretty weak. It tasted like Mango Lemonade from Genghis Grill. It was pretty at least.

Overall: A good choice for a moderate priced steak meal for the New Tampa/USF area."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Okay so first off, heres a heads up: this place is new. They are still working out the kinks of new employees, atmosphere, etc so do your best to keep an open mind and give them a chance.

I tried this place on a Sunday afternoon. It was busy and quite clearly (based on the tables that hadn't been cleaned), understaffed. Upon walking in, we were directed to a table and told it would be a few minutes. About 10-15 minutes go by and no one has come by to wait on us.
The fellow who sat us at our table originally, Stephen, came over when he saw we were still waiting and helped us while profusely apologizing for the delay. He explained that unfortunately they were understaffed for the day and he appreciated our patience. Right away thats a gold star in my book. He was respectful and appreciative of our patience, something that is ridiculously rare these days.

The food came out super fast! It was pretty good and overall reasonably priced. The kitchen definitely had their A-game on when it came to time and quality.

Normally this would have been a 3 star experience for me. The food was good, but the wait at first always throws me off. Tables needed to be cleaned pretty badly, which is something that MUST be fixed. However, Stephen's kindness and attentiveness has brought it up to 4. I would love to be able to go back on a different day and update this review to a 5 star."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The food was very good and the service was very friendly.

The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food was good but the service was not great.I was so excited to try this place. I was extremely excited to try it since it was so close to my home. I was also disappointed because I was expecting to enjoy it with a friend. I will say that the food was pretty good. I had the chicken wings with a side of fries. The wings were very crispy and juicy. The fries were really good. I got the Cuban sandwich which was a huge portion and tasted like Cuban bread. The bread was kind of cold and tasted a bit like flour. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Tampa or the area. I would recommend it for a quick bite to eat.The decor is nice, but the food is very good. I had the BBQ shrimp which was really good. I also had the fried shrimp which was really good. My boyfriend had the BBQ shrimp which was good but he didn't like it so he ate it. The service was great. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and very attentive.

We have tried several different food items on the menu and each time we have enjoyed everything. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always friendly and quick.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place makes you love being in Philadelphia.
We have gone here on numerous occassions. My humble belief is they have the best Cheesesteaks and Hot Roast Pork in the entire city, hands down. The only down side is the really limited hours, basically business hours. If you go, get the large, you will be full for lunch and dinner. The Roast Pork is excellently spiced, its just a little spicey which is great, its well gravyed, and the bread actually holds up, which is surprising. The cheesesteaks are just as good. I've had them with provolone, and they give a healthy portion of meat and cheese. This is really a side of the road kind of place. You get locals, passerbys, out of towners and business people all sitting at the same chipping red paint picnic tables outside. This is a guilty pleasure where we stop by on a day off and drop $7 for large sandwich and don't need lunch.

Take your friends for a fun, sitting outside, kind of picnic outing. Just don't expect to wash your hands your use the bathroom... because there isn't one. Be prepared to step in, wait in line for maybe 5 mins, and order pretty quickly. If you don't know what you want just say ""Steak with Cheese"" or ""Pork with Prov"" and you'll get something you like. Try the Port with the Spinach on it, its really good. If people say ""Pats and Geno's"" are the best in philadelphia, they don't know what they are talking about."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Yiros to order, love it.  
New spot in Roxborough serving great Greek fare at a reasonable price.  They provide quick service, a quality product and their delivery is really well run and very quick.  Have ordered from here multiple times now both on delivery and dine in.  You can choose from beef, pork, chicken or falafel as a yiro (gyro) sandwich, or choose from skewers both as is or served with salad or rice.  
The pita is excellent, fresh and well made and a perfect compliment to the yiro meat.  All of the meats are hand sliced fresh from their cooking spits, very authentic, it reminds me of the Schwarma places i went to in Israel.  I prefer the beef and pork, get it with the onions and tomato toppings and your choice of sauces.  The fresko, tzatziki, spicy tzatziki and spicy feta dips are all amazing paired with the sandwiches.  Their fries are hand cut and always hot and fresh, not as much with delivery but that is reasonable and to be expected when ordering for delivery, if you order them greek style it comes with feta and seasoning on top, really tasty.  
They are running quite well for a newer spot and hope they sustain their style of operations and can continue to function and provide the same great food and service.  Hoping to see expansion for this group and excited.  Great option for a quick and very reasonably priced dinner."

I ordered fries to go along with that so my total would've been around 2 dollars and some change. I have my paypal linked through my chick fil a account and I just use  whatever the balance is on there however at the window the lady said I had insufficient funds which wasn't correct. I had to pay with an actual card and they charged me 9 dollars instead of 2 something. I didn't find this out until I was half way home. I called and the guy there wasn't polite at all. First of all he hung up on me then I had to call back and he said either I drive all the way back or they give me the sandwich again as a treat. He didn't apologize for the inconvenience , he didn't even  try to see what might've happened. PayPal will probably charge me a fee because of this company's negligence.  I am still stuck on the fact that this guy was rude seeing how the people there are normally really nice smh. He probably needs more training because his customer service skills are lacking.

Today is that day.

This was my first trip to Hank's. And it will be my last. 

I walked in and ordered a bowl of Brunswick Stew for takeout.

That's it. Pretty simple. I'm a TV/Radio broadcaster and speak rather clearly.

For some reason, it took way too long to get my order. That's odd on its own when it is literally a bowl of soup and there's nobody else behind me.

What did I open when I got home? Gumbo. 

Gumbo was also on my receipt. This means the cashier was absolutely not paying attention.

I do not eat gumbo and there are ingredients in it to which I'm allergic.

Nice job, Hank's! What the hell are you doing?

I will be immediately returning to your store with this receipt, the gumbo untouched and a firm request for a refund.

No. I don't want any food from you, not your Brunswick Stew or anything else for my troubles. Save that free food for your next Yelp Elite event when the freeloaders show up and give you five stars because they didn't pay for anything. All I want is my money back for wasting my time coming into your store. 

Let this be a lesson to cashiers who are not paying attention to the customers. We're are simply tired of you not listening to us. Please pay attention or find a job where you do not have to interact with people."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I wish I could have taken a picture of the food but it was so bland I couldn't even finish it.  The duck was also very dry, and the greens were very bland.  The only thing I'd say is that they need to re-evaluate the menu.  I don't think they have a single option to make the chicken right, but I've heard great things about their other menu items.I used to love this place. I always feel very welcome. The food is always great, service is quick, and the prices are very reasonable. I just wish that they would have a menu like this that doesn't have a lot of options. It's a shame that I don't think this place will ever become a regular spot for me.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I feel sorry for the Yelper below who had a bad experience waiting for a very long time. I went there about 10mins after they started the operation but still, I had to wait. Very correct about the cashier doubled as a server. 

Myself is not a vegan but have attempted to be one previously. Therefore I do know the struggle Vegans have to face for being Vegans in New Orleans. It is not a very Vegan friendly city at all. When I saw Midnight Noodle on Facebook page, I decided to go check it out one day because I appreciate their effort to accommodate Vegans in our community. 

We gad steamed dumplings and smoked baos. The food was alright but I think I have a suggestion to make the dishes better even thought it might be just a personal opinion, of course. 

1. For baos, lower the amount of sugar in caramelized topping and add some sort of wet/thick consistency sauce on it; it can be regular sriracha or hoisin sauce. That way, it might balance out the blend taste from rice bun and tofu. What I am trying to say is that it is missing that good punch. 

2. For dumplings, swap the chili oil for that sweet soy sauce you had underneath the buns; it just soaked up the bun and did not work very well but I feel like diluted soy sauce would pair fantastically with your steamed dumplings.

Overall much appreciated for their great intention to support the vegan community therefore thank you."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Really disappointed with this one. I love German food, but I've had Army cooks prepare schnitzel better than this place. Schnitzel is usually a pretty thin cut of pork by nature, but this was ridiculous. Even the breading was terrible and the mushroom sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can. I asked if they prepared traditional potato pancakes, but that was a no. I was instead offered some greasy, chopped potatoes overpowered with rosemary garnish. My girlfriend had spaetzle with her dish and it was completely overcooked and somehow burnt in places. Finally, we ordered dessert. We thought ""Surely, they can't screw up apple strudel!"" Wrong. Bland. Dessert is the easiest thing to nail. C'mon guys.. Not worth the bother or the high price.

Update 9/28/16: If you want an idea of the level of professionalism and service you can expect, just take a moment and read the owner's replies to all the low reviews(including mine). In broken English and with a condescending tone, this is how he speaks to his customers. He tells me: ""I hope you find another German restaurant."" Well I did, years ago. It is called Mr. Dunderbak's and it is significantly better in every way. I wanted to give a little guy like Taste of Berlin a chance, but I ended up with the taste of disappointment instead. This owner's shitty attitude and food has ensured that not only will I never return to this place, but I will also do my best to steer people away in the future."

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I don't normally bother reviewing the national chains. They're a necessary evil. But my son is interested in establishing the new routine of going out for breakfast once a weekend, and I let him pick the first restaurant; he chose Taco Bell. This particular Taco Bell was quite good, which is why I'm taking the time to review it.

He ordered tacos -- with the orange Dorito shell -- at 8:30 a.m. Meat only. He's picky as can be. He devoured them. I decided to try one of TB's Crunch Wraps -- hash brown, egg, sausage, cheese, and a little bit of a hot sauce, tucked inside a tortilla. It wasn't bad at all! Filling, too. It came with a couple little cinnamon bun bomb thingies, which were delicious, and certainly heart attack inducing. The coffee was relatively bland and weak, but I have had way, way worse.

It goes without saying -- but will say it nonetheless -- that this is a far cry from authentic Mexican food. And some Taco Bell restaurants are just plain nasty: they're dirty, and/or the tacos taste like they're made with canned dog food. This is not one of those Taco Bells. This restaurant was clean and the staff was courteous, friendly, and helpful. 

I get to pick the spot next weekend for our breakfast crawl, and admittedly, I'm not going to choose Taco Bell. But if my son wants to come back here when it's his turn to decide, I won't complain at all. I'm already thinking about those cinnamon bun bombs!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Topgolf is a lot of fun.  This origional and unique driving range is different because of several reasons.  One, they serve food and just about any beverage you could think of.  Two, the golf balls are microchiped, and there are targets spaced out throughout the driving range.  Three, the whole thing is computerized and has several games.  If you hit a target, you get a score.  The further the target and closer to the center, the higher the score.

This is not just a place to hit balls, this is a bar, restaurant, and night club.  This is a place to hang out with your friends, or bring the whole family to have a good time.  Even dogs are welcome!

The staff is very friendly and helpful about how to use the game, and you can ask for help anytime! 

The food is great, especially, tuna sandwich and mini donut hole. Drinks are delicious, some of them are served with the sparkling fishbowl and golf ball cup. 

They get really popular fast, you might need to wait an hour to few hours to be seated to the bay to play golf. Well, you can always kill the waiting time with the game room on the third floor and the pool tables in the first floor! Or hang out at the full bar on the main floor and third floor! If it's a Friday or Saturday night, you can even sing karaoke!

My daughter had Toffee Hot Chocolate and I had the Criollo (milk chocolate cream and peppermint schnapps). We waited about fifteen minutes for our drinks.I'd have thought these drinks would not have been so hard to make being it's a chocolate restaurant and all. 
Anyway. The hot chocolate comes in a ""Hug A Mug"" You wrap your hands around it and sip from the front. However, it was so hot that my daughter could not do this and used her spoon to eat it like soup. I wish my tepid drink could have had some of that heat. 

We also ordered the Urban S'Mores. It consist of of a little ramekin of peanut butter, one of jelly, a bowl of marshmallows and a little beaker of melted chocolate. They bring along a little Sterno heater for you to ""roast your marshmallows"". How long do you think it would take to prep all this? Five minutes if you move slow? 15 if you are super slammed? It took us 25 minutes to have this served to us. 
Considering how long we waited for everything I was none too happy with the bill. Had the service moved faster I would not have thought twice about it. And now that I see they have a kids menu, that was never offered to us, I really feel ripped off."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"What an awful experience! Around 5pm on Memorial Day, I placed my order on the Dickeys website. My confirmation stated my order would be delivered at 6:30pm. Cool. 6:15 comes, and I get a text from door dash that my order will be delivered in 15 mins. Then I get another text at 6:30pm (the time my order should be delivered) stating my order has been cancelled because it wasn't confirmed by the restaurant! So I call the restaurant and explain. She asked my name, then immediately told me she didn't get my order - like there wasn't even time for her to look. So I ask if I can give her my order over the phone and I'm told she isn't taking phone orders right now and I can re-place it online. Well what's the point in that if they didn't get it the first time? So I drive all the way to the restaurant. I'm then told it would be 30-45 mins for an order. An order I at this point had placed over 2 hours ago??? I told her no thank you and left. Went to Famous Dave's instead who had WAY better service (even with being busy). 

Here's the kicker - they still charged my credit card for an order they CLAIMED to have never recieved. I've made multiple contacts to the company and have yet to get a response. Looks luke I'll probably have to dispute the transaction with my bank. HORRIBLE customer service and AWFUL business practices. I wont be going here anymore!"

We arrived a little before 5:30, so it was pretty busy.  We sat at the bar which was very nice.  The bartender was very friendly and knew the menu.  We ordered the fried oysters and crab cakes.  The crab cakes were delicious!  The oysters were a little dry and the crab cakes were a little salty.  Overall, I liked the food and the decor.  I would definitely come back again!

I ordered the fried oysters.  They were okay, but the oysters were over cooked and they tasted like they were sitting in a huge bowl.  The fried oysters were good, but the fried crab cakes were a little salty.  I probably would have given them a 5 star if I had a bite.

By 11:20 am the line was out the door and turned to the right down the sidewalk. It is worth the wait. The decor is nice but unfortunately not a lot of seating. People were standing around waiting to get tables as they became available. My husband and I looked over the menu. They serve breakfast all day, but we were craving lunch. All combos can be served as a taco, burrito, wet burrito, nachos or salad. Make any selection a meal by adding sides (Guacamole, queso, salsa, black bean dip, trifecta, pinto beans, Mexican Rice and Chips). I ordered the Ranger (BBQ pulled pork, spicy slaw, jack & cheddar cheese, sour cream, cilantro, pickled jalapeno, chipotle BBQ) wet burrito style with queso. Huge portion and absolutely delicious. My husband picked the Aces High Carnitas (Traditional fried pork, cilantro, onion, chihuhua cheese, lime, salsa verde), wet burrito style with queso. Best burritos we've ever eaten. We also got a side of chips and mild salsa. Out of this world. Never tasted any as unique as their chips. We will be back to check out more of the items they offer.

We had a very large group of people and it was a good size for the size. We started with the shrimp tempura with salmon. It was very good and the flavor was very fresh. We also had the miso soup and my husband had the pork belly with pork belly. Both were excellent. My husband had the sweet potato pancake with lobster sauce and my husband had the shrimp tempura with scallops. We enjoyed each of them. Our server was very attentive and friendly. They have a very small outdoor patio and we were able to sit outside. It was nice and quiet. My husband and I had a great time with the staff and the food was delicious!

Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Once I placed the red dusty deliciousness of a fiery loco shell that was expertly placed in a cheesy gordita crunch in my mouth and the creamy sauce balanced with the sharp cheddar converged into a rush of flavor in my mouth I knew this was going to be a fourth meal to remember. Their ample supply of fire sauce kicked up my taco experience up a couple notches. I was pleased to know that the ghost pepper griller was available on the menu, and the expert craftsmen of this fine establishment swirled together a delicious combo of salty beef, crunchy red Fritos, sharp creamy cheddar, and noise hair tingling ghost peeper sauce! It made me wanna say boo! But in a good way like ""that's my boo"". Thank god I had a Baja blast to sooth my burning throat, and I intermixed my blue carbonated gulps with some sumptuous bites of a classic bean and cheese burrito. The true test of any t-bell is the composition of the signature item. Not only was the bean to cheese ratio spot on, but the red sauce and crispy onion distribution was well above normal. The soft tortilla felt like something naughty in my mouth, and there was no clumps of ingredients isolated in the front or back of the burrito, what a even distribution! No one likes their red sauce all in the back of the burrito, if you know what I mean. The only thing preventing a fifth star is the 11 o'clock closing time, sometimes fourth meal is considerably later."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place is exactly what I imagined the inside of a pub to look like--bar meets restaurant, old fireplace burning, dimly lit, with exposed brick and wood panels lining the walls of its interior. 

Food: Every once in a while, a girl just needs a good hamburger, so when I came here on an empty stomach with some friends, my eyes instantly went to the first hamburger option I saw on the menu. I ordered a burger (but got the smaller 1/4 lb option) and added bacon and blue cheese crumbles to it (ermagersh) and had fries on the side. I actually loved it. In fact, I ate every last bite (except for the raw onions that came with my burger...but really, does anyone ever eat those?). The bun was soft on the outside and toasted on the inside, the hamburger itself was delicious, and I tell ya, all you have to do is add a little bit of blue cheese and bacon to a burger and you're having a party. 

Service: We had the sweetest waitress (Kelly). She was so friendly and had a warm demeanor. Our drinks were filled the whole time and she was quick to bring us anything we asked for. Also, our food didn't take too long, I'd say about 15 minutes in total.

Vibe: Not my favorite, but cozy. This is for-sure a pub, so it has a unique appeal of it's own. Some people will love this kind of vibe, but it wasn't my favorite.

Overall: Good meal, good service, good location, and vibes/ambiance is ok."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"As a Nashville native, I find it hard to find good BBQ in Nashville, and I was pretty excited to try this place. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the pork, and the quality of the meat. The pulled pork was very moist, tender and juicy. The brisket was flavorful, but not too sweet. The ribs were very tender and flavorful. The cornbread was very good. The baked beans were very good, and the cornbread was a good size for the price. I had the brisket sandwich, and I liked the flavor and the amount of meat. The brisket was really good. The cornbread was a little too sweet for my liking. I'll be back for sure. This place is my favorite pizza place in the city. I've had a few pizza's and some pizza's and they have the best crust ever. I've had the white pizza, the pizza with garlic sauce, and the pizza with mozzarella. The crust is thin and the pizza is fresh and chewy. The pizza is made to order so it is always fresh. I have ordered online, and order delivery, and the pizza is always hot and hot! I don't have any complaints about this place. I have also ordered delivery from here twice now."

The fish was so fresh and seasoned well. The guacamole was pretty good. The chips were a little salty for me but it was still pretty good. The guac was really good. I got the Cuban sandwich which was a huge portion and tasted like Cuban bread with some breading. The sandwich was very good and I had some sauce on it to dip it in. It came with chips which was a nice touch. I went with the mango salsa which was a good choice. It was good but not amazing. I would have liked a bit more of a spicy kick. The guacamole was good and the tacos were good. The guacamole was spicy and tasted fresh and it was very fresh. The service was fast and friendly. They were very attentive and friendly. I would go back again. This is a great place for a quick bite to eat. The food is good.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Goodness Juice Bar is probably is just OOOkkkkaaayyy in my book and here's why.

They definitely are going for the hipster-trendy-healthy-LAesque kinda feel. The decor and vibe of the restaurant definitely achieves that goal. But I feel like the food definitely fell short. For such a high price tag (especially for Tucson, but to be honest I won't pay that much even if Goodness was in LA)

Healing vibe juice: $6.5 for the smaller size. It was so strong of ginger it was difficult to swallow. I'm a fan of ginger and have had ginger in lots of juices before, this one just tasted like your aunt's hangover cure. Temperature wise, the drink was luke-warm so it was pretty hard to down. Just meh.

I LOOOOVE acai bowls, and I've been craving it so much since I moved down to Tucson. Unfortunately, Goodness' bowls fell short of my expectations (again, for such a high price tag I expected better, the average acai bowl in Phoenix/ LA are usually $5 or 6 at most). The bowls were liquidy, not quite frozen-cold. 

Mango Jungle $8.75 (3.5/5): tastes pretty great, besides the fact that it was pretty melted/ soggy when served, I enjoyed the blend of sweet honey/ mild with the tart taste of mango. 
Pink dragon $8.75 (1/5) : I've hard real dragon fruit in Asia and this tasted nowhere near the real taste of dragonfruit. Again, the bowl was melted and soggy; just very disappointing.

Anyhow, I won't be back anytime soon. If anyone knows of a place with decent acai bowls, please let a sistah knows."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"One of the best ""authentic"" Mexican restaurants in the city.  Really small inside and usually pretty much full, but that's ok with me because I always get take out.  It's kind if super loud and a little stuffy at the tables because of the small size and the open kitchen. 
Anyway, the food...
It's pretty spectacular in size and taste.  My favorites are definitely the chicken tacos and the mole enchiladas.
The tacos were over filled, but with really nicely flavored chicken.  All white, kind of pulled in texture.  Topped with onions, cilantro, and served with limes and radishes, as well as a side of amazing homemade salsa verde and a sort of chipoltle white (creamy) sauce.  Both awesome.
The mole enchiladas was an entree.  It was enormous, on a scale of being at least two full meals.  The mole sauce was one of the better ones I've had.  Nicely balanced with sweetness and spice.  But could have been hotter (spicier) for me.  Came with rice and beans (good here as well) and topped with some greens, a little sour cream, and a nice sprinkle of Oaxaca cheese.  
They also have a nice variety of Mexican sodas and juices, including my fave, the jarritos mandarin soda, the greatest compliment to any Mexican food in my opinion!
So, if you're close enough to stop here, or for delivery, and don't mind spending a little more than you might be used to for Mexican food ( you get what you pay for,) then get there fast!"

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I want to share our experience in hopes that others will be saved from the same disappointment. We ordered a 3 tiered $120. 00 cake for a 1st birthday party. The design was not exactly what was ordered but beautiful non-the less. An employee put the cake into the car; no special directions or instructions were given at that time or prior to picking up the cake. As the driver, I can say I drove exactly how anyone with a $120 cake that is a gift would SLOW & CAREFUL. despite this when I arrived back at the house the top tier of the cake had slide off and was smashed in the box. My sister, whose daughter I brought the cake for was understandably upset but determined to not let it ruin the day. We pieced what we could back together and covered it with icing. When my sister called L & M the following day to tell them what happened, not to receive any financial compensation, but to let them know they should warn customers that this can happen, she spoke to the manager Christy who was not only unapologetic, but down right rude. My sister was told if was not their responsibility and insinuated that the driver was reckless. She went so far as to question the fact that the cake was picked up in a BMW, which must mean the driver was careless. Buyer beware- the cake was unsupported, poorly packed and no warning or directions were given, but that's not their fault."

The guy who answered the phone when I called to make a reservation was very soft spoken that it was kind of hard to hear him.

The boyfriend ordered the Chicken Katsu Bento Box $17.00 came with California Roll, Dumpling, Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura; It also comes with white rice but the boyfriend requested for brown rice which is $1 more. You also get your choice of soup or salad. He had the salad which was pretty good.

We also had the France Roll Shrimp $12.95 tempura with shrimp and avocado on the top served w. sesame sauce and the Devil Roll; Sorry, it's not on their website and I don't remember how much it was or what was in it! I do remember there was a strawberry mochi tasting kind of sauce on it; Not my favorite but it's more a personal preference.

Oh, I also Yelped this place before coming and love how they decorate their plates. I didn't get anything that glowed but it was nicely drawn on.

The service was good and quick.

There weren't many people there but there was 2 ladies and a girl that walked in. On the way in, one girl grabbed a handful of candy from the counter. They sat down then walked out without ordering anything. On the way out, one of them grabbed another handful of candy.. Very nice ladies."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"A friend recommended that we go to Mr. Martino's for our anniversary. We made a reservation, and then saw all the reviews on Yelp. It seems like people either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. After my dinner there, I am one of the people that absolutely loves it. I think the people who hate it must have expected some Olive Garden type restaurant with lots of lighting and no character.

It is cozy inside, and dimly lit. The staff were very friendly the entire time. It wasn't super-fast service, but I didn't want to be rushed in and out in 30 min. Part of the atmosphere is drinking a bottle of wine (it's a BYO) and have the food come out at a more leisurely pace.

On to the food: after reading some reviews, we both got the white bean soup. It was delicious! The waitress said afterwards that it is actually a vegan soup. I would never have guessed, it was so flavorful.

For main courses I ordered the spinach ravioli with butter-nutmeg sauce and asparagus. Wonderful! My boyfriend got veal tortellini in a creamy tomato and gorgonzola sauce. Very tasty. The food wasn't the most amazing I've ever had, but it was very good and better than you would expect for the price.

We were too full for dessert but the tiramisu' at other tables looked very good too.

I loved the food and the atmosphere of Mr. Martino's. It is small inside though and is definitely not fast-food, so maybe it isn't for everyone. Also, they don't accept credit cards, but they do accept checks."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went here a month or so ago and almost forgot to review them. 

I would recommend this place to someone who is a newbie with Dim Sum, as they have western style ordering and most of the dishes are ""American friendly"".
Overall the service was decent and the food we got was decent, but as someone married to a Shanghainese man, I know good 小笼包 (xiao long bao).

These were like.. 7/10, pretty good! But I've had better.. unfortunately not around Philly but in Toronto.. and in Shanghai haha!

Anyway this is a good ""gateway"" dimsum location if you're not super particular about authenticity.

Some dishes were authentic, but the minute you see things like sesame chicken on the menu, it makes one wonder if they deviate elsewhere.
I was disappointed they didn't have the dark, fried chicken feet.. only the vinegar ones.. which are so meh.. takes like the skin of my nails when I bite them. Gross? Yeah.. but that's what they were like.. Largely tasteless but the texture of finger skin hahah.

But that's expert level Chinese food an American like myself so I didn't really gig Dim Sum Garden for that.

My -2 stars is more for the overall more western feel of the place. Major cantonese dim sum staples were missing from the menu and that was disappointing. It made me wish I was a true Dim Sum restaurant, rather than a Chinese-American restaurant that HAPPENS to have a few Dim Sum options. So many good Dim Sum favorites were missed that night.
What we DID get was good though, I'll say that, but not especially memorable."

Here goes. 1) Got seated, guy with broken English yelled at us for not understanding his attempt at saying ""What kind of tea do you want? Do you drink tea?"" I'm Asian, and I'm good with accents. Weird. 2) Only service we got was from the friendly cart lady and food. Assigned waiter never once came over, even when I signaled for him to come over. 3) Made the decision to pay the bill and leave without a tip, knowing full well the consequences after reading Mindy C's review. 4) As we left, jackass waiter had the nerve to say, ""You forgot to leave tip!"" at the top of the stairs with all of the patrons waiting to be seated around us. Everyone got quiet, and I replied back, ""You didn't even serve us. "" 

In my hero moment, I turned around and continued down the stairs. 5) Much to my surprise, he actually followed us outside (per Mindy C's experience). So we knew what to do, we just turned around, shook our heads, and continued walking. It felt great. Actually, it was kind of funny because it transpired EXACTLY as Mindy C wrote, down to the street chasing. Now, the food here isn't that bad, I go on occasion with a group of friends. I just feel like giving one star for the non-service we got. I wonder if they'll kick me out next time I go with a group. I'll even wear the same blue UPenn sweater today so they can recognize me."

Highly recommended.This place is a must visit for any traveler! The service is outstanding and the food is amazing! I highly recommend the grilled cheese plate and the spinach artichoke dip! My husband's burger and fries were also delicious! The staff was very friendly and the place was clean!

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If you're a New Orleans ""institution,"" hire a staff that falls in line with what you're attempting to be. Drinks should be out 5-10 minutes after we order, especially since they were all bottled (wine and champagne) and not hand-prepared. When the drinks do FINALLY arrive, know how to open and pour them. First, remove the wire hood of the champer and gently twist off the cork. Then hold the champagne with your thumb of the pouring hand in the ""punt"" (bottom), spread your fingers across the base, tip and pour gently. You know what, actually, I don't even care how you hold it but don't overflow the glass (not once but twice ...) and then not wipe the flute down.

When one person asks for another beer (we shouldn't have to, the server should be asking us) make sure to ask the rest of the party if they'd like refills. Don't walk away in oblivion and force us to shout after you.

When one of the servers bumps me hard with his tray, say excuse me and/or I'm sorry. Saying nothing ""says"" way more about your service.

Food? Meh. The fish I had was so salty I felt dried up after I ate it. And I like salt. I LOVE SALT. But this fish was over-salted and over-cooked. My appetizer, the tomato and shrimp, was tasty. That, I did enjoy. End-of-meal sweets were end-of-meal sweets, except my colleague ordered a coffee and Baileys ... only to receive the coffee first then wait 5 minutes for the Baileys. Presentation, people!

Unimpressed across the board. Save your money and go somewhere else."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Located on the main drag of the Gulf Coast, this is a nice place to grab a bite to eat. The food is always fresh and the staff is always friendly. The only downside is that it is hard to get a seat at the bar. This is a great place to have a drink and catch up with friends!They have a great variety of beer on tap. I love the awesome live music. The beer selection is pretty good. The food is a little pricey for the amount of food you get. The salad bar is a little lacking in options. I think it's a little pricey, but the food is great and the prices are fair. I would say get there early if you are in the area.I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. My favorite thing is the fries, the fries are made fresh every time I come. The service is always on point. The only negative thing is that I've never had a bad meal here. I highly recommend this place.I've had many times in the past, and I've always had good service. I have had a very good experience, and I've had very good food.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I was so excited to try this place out because it was a nice place to have dinner and we had a great time! The food was good but the service was terrible. I had to go to the bar and get a drink to get refills. I had to ask for the bartender to take my order because I was so hungry. I got the shrimp and grits which was very good. The shrimp was not seasoned well and the grits were very bland. I had to ask for extra sauce on my grits. The food was okay but not worth the price.I'm a huge fan of the sushi, and this place is probably the best in Tucson. I've only had the prime rib and the shrimp tempura rolls, and I've never had a bad meal there. My only gripe is the wait. I've been there about a dozen times and the place is always packed.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I recently went to a wedding that was catered by Russo's. The food was really, really good. The vegetable medley was prepared just right and cooked the perfect amount of time to make them not to mushy or to tough. I also loved the pork and for the more part, I don't eat a lot of pork (except bacon). It looked so good that I had to try it. The gravy was the perfect consistency and just a touch of it was excellent on the pork. The chicken was stuffed and a little dry, but everything else was so good that I barely noticed it. My date is a food snob and raved about the pork.  He is no stranger to the finest restaurants in town, so I was a little nervous he would complain about the food.  Not one complaint, except he agreed about the chicken being a little dry.   

I do not know if Russo's made the cake, but it was excellent. There was a chocolate cake with white icing. A white cake with white icing and creamy fudge in the middle. Also a white cake with white icing and strawberry filling. Being the dedicated Yelper that I am, I tried all of them!!! Just wanted to make sure I could give a full report :) 

I spoke to the bride and she said the process was super simple with Russo's.  She had a tasting and decided what she wanted.  She never had to think about any of it again until she had her meal the night of her wedding."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm a bit of a ""city snob,"" I'll happily admit that.  I proudly live in the city, play in the city, and nearly exclusively dine in the city.  But I do work in the Westport area, and at least once a month my co-workers and I indulge in what we endearingly call ""Thai Thursday.""  And Thai Thursday always means the Thai Kitchen.

As you can imagine, after being regulars for a couple years they know us here.  The staff is awesome.  They're often ""strictly business"" during the frenzied lunch hour, but in the midst of all their hurried work are always pleasant and friendly.

I have only eaten here for lunch, but you simply *cannot* beat the portions you get for the price you pay (about $7.95 a plate).  I love the ""Spicy Noodle,"" and their Pad Thai is a heaping, flavorful dish.  My co-workers usually get either the green or red curried rice dishes with vegetables.  Often they will get one of the soups, and the amount of fresh, flavorful ingredients and (again) huge portions should make Mai Lee feel damned ashamed of themselves.

Appetizers are great as well.  The Papaya Salad is zesty and spicy at the same time and exceptional.  The fried tofu is another favorite.  Goes great with a Thai coffee.

To get my fifth star, a place needs to have ""it"" when it comes to environment.  TK is just fine for lunch, but a bit small and can often be cramped in there.

Definitely in the conversation for best Thai in the entire STL metro area."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We have been here multiple times, the food is mediocre at best but we go for the view. We took my mom to celebrate her birthday this particular time and were sat at a hexagon shaped table. My one year old was with us and needed a high chair so they brought a booster that sat on the bench. I thought it was strange but they must have done it several times for them to have brought it to us? So the food was coming I strapped my son in the seat and reached to grab my food, my son fell off the seat still strapped into this high chair hitting his head on the concrete and one foot from falling off the sea wall. I scrambled to pick him up and turned back around and the food runner was gone. Didn't stay to make sure he was ok. Nothing. Our server (jada I think) came back by and asked if someone fell and apologized. The manager (molly I think) came 15 minutes later, apologized and took the chair. I told her I didn't know if we were going to take him to the hospital yet I was going to see how he acted. She came back 15 minutes later asked for my name, nothing else, so they obviously won't be calling to check up on him. And after I was too shaken up to eat, brought me my check. Good hospitality isn't their strong point. Thank goodness my son is ok so far and that is what I am most concerned with but they could have done better."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We came in last Friday night after traveling all day from California to Chicago and then driving from Chicago to Indy. We were beat and just wanted a good meal before checking into the hotel. Despite the fact that they were closing in 30-40 minutes after we got there, everyone including our server was friendly, helpful and most of all provided great service! The restaurant (well what I saw of it) was nice and clean. Very old world feel but didn't feel OLD. 

The server recommended the Shrimp Cocktail which St Elmo's (their sister restaurant) are known for. It definitely has a lot of kick! It's not a lingering hotness but does go right up your nose. If you love spicy, then you will love the shrimp cocktail. It's still good if you don't love spicy, but I would recommend being cautious with the sauce!

All 4 of us ordered boneless ribeyes and we ALL loved them. They were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Really amazing. I think we all ordered Medium Rare to Medium. Really delish...I would highly recommend them! 

It IS pricey though. The 10 pc shrimp cocktail was about $32 and the ribeyes were $37 each with 1 side if I remember correctly. It was worth it for us. We just wanted a really good meal and they provided exactly that but it's not somewhere I'd eat weekly strictly due to the price. The server was also nice enough to split our bill however we needed to which I know can be a pain for them. 

I will definitely have to come back if I'm ever in Indy again!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"After we checked into our hotel in Indianapolis, we wanted to hit a place with good food and good beer. I came across Twenty Tap on yelp and decided to check it out. No regrets.

Great beer selection with the majority of them costing only $5. They also offer the pint of the day for only $3.50! What a steal. I was pretty overwhelmed by the beer list, but for a beer lover like myself..that's not a bad thing. I love being able to try new beers especially if they're local.

Friendly service- our waiter was extremely attentive and helpful. 

The décor is meh..looks like a regular bar/restaurant. But it was pretty clean, so that's a plus.

Now for the food...
Beer cheese curds - good flavor but tad salty - chipotle & chimichurri sauce not too memorable. Chipotle tastes good but no kick to it like you would expect from a chipotle sauce.
Smoked brisket sandwich - definitely had a kick to it when I ate it alone without the bread. Taste (not texture) for some reason reminded me of beef jerky. Maybe the sweetness of the sauce? Not too sure, but it was tasty nonetheless. 
Oh and the portion size was HUGE. 
I tried a bite of my friend's Cuban sandwich and it was good as well. Nice crunch from the toasted bread. 
The fries were amazinggg. Perfectly seasoned and nice and crunchy. 

Overall - I really liked my visit to Twenty Tap and if I were a local I would be regular. I come to Indy at least once a year for a game, so I'll be sure to come back here!"

We ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, chicken fingers, and the catfish burger. The chicken fingers were juicy and flavorful, and the catfish burger was delicious! The catfish burger was a little dry, but not dry at all. The fries were delicious, and the fries were fresh and hot. The catfish burger was perfect."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I first tried Blue at a Yelp event and was impressed by the creative rolls that they had us sample. On this particular day there was a block party taking place outside where Blue was serving a limited menu, including a delicious yellowtail sashimi with serrano peppers in a ponzu sauce. After trying this I knew I had to step inside for lunch. My friend and I were seated at the bar during our visit. 

The crab rangoons immediately caught my eye. So often crab rangoons are prepared with imitation crab, but not so here! They use real crab meat paired with a sweet and spicy mango sauce for this dish. Definitely one of the better versions I've had around town, and I would order them on next visits. I also ordered a gringo roll and fatty salmon nigiri. My roll was a good size and presented well. It was my first time having fatty salmon and I enjoyed the fish. Since I don't have a comparison, I don't know if it's usually served with the skin on, but it is here. For dessert I had the chocolate torte. For the vegans/vegetarians out there, this is for you. This treat satisfied my considerable sweet tooth, and the pairing of chocolate with raspberry sorbet was just fantastic.

All in all I enjoyed my lunch here. The service left a bit to be desired, with our server leaving us unattended for long stretches of time. We ordered drinks with her that ultimately someone else had to take because she never put them in. This aside, I'd for sure go back for more great sushi."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The PMA is one of the best museums I've been to in a while. I loved every minute of the 5 or 6 hours I spent there. There's so much to see and it's all worth it. Students (yes my old a** is still a student, grad, but student nonetheless) get a pretty nice discount with identification or school email. With general admission you're able to see the permanent collection in the main building, the Perlman Building across the way, and the Rodin Museum for 48 hours. 

There were a lot of class groups the day I went, but the main building is so large I was able to pretty much avoid them all day. I browsed the different collections until I was famished and headed down to their cafeteria. They have specials for the day and I ordered a hefty baked potato. I was able to top it with a plethora of item from the salad bar including grilled chicken, shrimp salad, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, bacon, mushrooms, etc. Wasn't too bad of a deal for $8. 

The best part about this museum is the interior architecture and design (that may be because im a designer but whatev, call me biased)! It's really beautiful how they've modeled the interior with original or exceptional replicas of pillars, doors, windows, tiles (floor and ceiling), stone work, etc. for each time period or geographic location.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to see special Leger exhibit, but maybe I'll be able to get back to see it. If I lived in Philly I'd get a membership, that's how much I love and want to support it!"

We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table for 2.  The food was average.  I had the 2 eggs with sausage and bacon, which were over cooked and barely warm.  I will say that the sausage was good, but it was not as good as the eggs.  The bacon was very dry, which is not a bad thing.  

The coffee is good, but it was a bit too sweet.  The coffee is made with a lot of coffee beans, which I like.  They have a small coffee menu and I tried one that I found to be a little too sweet.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Zoe's is a clean, sleek, welcoming ""chain"" of restaurants featuring Mediterranean-inspired and health-inspired salads and entrees.

Husband and I stopped in for a late lunch, early dinner on the most recent Sunday afternoon. It took some dragging and cajoling to pull the husband in there. However, a preview of the menu online revealed enough steak entree options to keep him from dragging me back out.

I ordered the ""Live Med"" salad (spinach, thin sliced summer squash, grape tomatoes, sliced fava beans, sharp cheese, and grains - farro, I think - with a savory dressing on the side. To that, I added a ""new"" additional add-in (with an upcharge): baked falafel.

Husband ordered the steak sandwich. (He was very pleased with it!)

My salad was huge, the greens and vegetables appealing, squeaky clean, and absolutely fresh. The dressing was a winner, made from natural ingredients and devoid of sugar or corn syrup.

The baked falafel was interesting, but  it was very dry, crusty, and, if thrown at a vehicle, would probably dent it as well as golf-ball sized hail. (OK, I'm exaggerating slightly - but not by much.) Crumbled into small pieces and mixed into the salad, it worked much better than eating it on its own. 

John and I split a piece of ""homemade"" chocolate cake for dessert. Mmmm. At under $3 for a large piece, it was a great value for such a delicious sweet.

Kudos to Zoes for serving on reusable dining and tableware instead of adding more plasticware to landfills.

The counter staff was friendly and the service was prompt.

Five stars for this healthy fast food experience and awesome cake, despite the toothy falafel balls."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The last time I stopped at this place, it was a tiny Italian market with no restaurant. Since we have an Italian market in our neighborhood, we didn't bother going back, but then a friend mentioned the restaurant here and said it was fantastic if you were over in this part of town. So glad he mentioned it! What a great find!

What we've eaten here: caprese salad (great), tortellini elliston (my husband ordered this and it was so good that I stole it from him), vegetarian lasana (this was good, but not as good as the tortellini), tiramisu, raspberry gelato

Pros:
*Tasty food
*Great option in this part of town
*Italian market, so you could do some shopping as well
*Free and plentiful parking
*Outdoor patio (was under construction when we were there I think)
*Reasonable prices

Cons:
*The decor was kind of ""eh""
*Only 3 high chairs

Kid-friendly scale: 
Definitely kid friendly. We usually have a travel rubber placemat with us (for easier clean up in restaurants) and I thought the waiter was going to cry when he saw it. When I saw the pasta sauce the kids left smeared all over the table next to us, I understood why. The waiter's vibe definitely got much more kid-friendly when he saw our placemat. Anyway, this is a great place to go with kids. The only downside was that they only have three high chairs - all of them were in use when we got there, but one of them opened up by the time our food came. 

Vegetarian-friendly scale:
While this place is definitely more meat-oriented, there were a number of decent vegetarian options available. The tortellini elliston in particular was quite good."

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Okay, so I may have been a bit harsh with my first review of this Earl's. It's a little better than I remembered last. We recently gave it another chance since we had a gift card to use up.

The lounge is a lot larger than the dining area, and is actually more comfortable to sit in. The dining area is too small, and feels really cramped with the tables so close together. You don't get any privacy that way.

I had the hickory ribs and my bf had the quesadillas. I thought the waitress had gotten my order wrong when she brought it to me, because the ribs looked rather like a steak, having no bones in the meat. She explained to me that that's how their ribs are. Not what I was expecting, but okay. The steak -- I mean, ribs -- was pretty good though, just the right amount of hickory seasoning, not overcooked or undercooked. And I really liked the green beans that came with it for some reason. They tasted really fresh!

My bf's quesadillas turned out to be really good too, but what I liked the best was his fries on the side. Who knew that some of the best fries ever would be at Earl's?

The service was pretty good too, and I liked our waitress as she seemed really sweet, if not a little absent-minded. Most of the waitresses here appear to be quite young.

Overall, a nice evening out at Earl's. We left with pleasantly full stomachs. Would I come back again? I'm not so sure. Maybe if a friend suggested it, but not out of my own choice."

Next, after 1 hour, we were sat and offered truffle fries for our inconvenience , yes please! These were amazing, crisp hand cut fries drenched in truffle oil- now some reviews say they are greasy- people, this is not grease, this is truffle oil, as in truffle mushroom that are like 1 million dollars a pound (cue Austin Powers, Dr Evil). There was also cheese and parsley and everything you want to like the bowl clean. Ox tail braised with ravioli - perfectly cooked, tender, rich sauce, large ravioli al dente- bread to pair and scoop sauce and meat, yum! everything perfect. until the taste of cinnamon came through. nope- no me gusta!
Special - soft shell crab, fried crisp a top of creamy polenta- oh my oh my oh my. Perfect dish. Braised short rib with big old noodles- perfection rich sauce, tender braised meat. Apps- prosciutto flat bread- ok, but very sweet, lacked balance
Duck liver - yum, creamy with accoutrements to match. Dessert- beignets, really thick delicious dough balls with green tea ice cream. They were kind enough to give us 4, instead of 3 so there was no fighting!

The only thing I don't like about this place is the fact that it's so packed. It's not a good sign, especially when it's packed. But it's definitely a great place to hang out, hang out, and have a beer while you wait for your food.We live in the area and love the atmosphere and the food. We always order the shrimp dumplings, the shrimp dumplings were great, and the garlic noodles were delicious. I usually get the lamb dumplings and the rice dumplings. The spicy pork dumplings were ok, but I would definitely order a side of them again. I would also order the fried rice and fried rice with the shrimp dumplings. I have no complaints about this place. We will definitely go back.We have been to this restaurant several times.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Their pizza is a change-up from ""normal"" Italian and specialty gourmet (e.g. brick or coal oven) pies.   Chewy crust, inconsistent thickness, unevenly cooked crust (charred in some places, undercooked in others), difficult to eat w/o using a knife and fork (my wife gave in).  It's interesting, but it's like Pica's in Upper Darby and West Chester -- I could only eat it a couple of times per year.  

She had a salad -- it was OK.  We had wings -- OK, but not anywhere near as good as Anthony's Coal Fired.  

Service had two quirks:

1. Our waitress was friendly and inattentive.  Staff hang out at the counter and chat, and they forget to look over at the customers.  I actually had to get up twice and walk over to her.  

2. The server for the table behind us kept hitting my chair when he walked by.  After the third time, I realized he was doing it intentionally to punish me for being in his way.  Hey, I didn't put the tables and chairs there, and I didn't pick the table we sat at.  After the third time, I looked at him -- and it didn't happen again.  Passive-aggressive is not a good look for a waiter (or his restaurant).  

The bill was high for what we got (food and service).

If someone asked me to go back because they really wanted to go there, I would.  Otherwise, there are dozens (literally dozens) of better choices within a 10 min drive.  Heck, there are a dozen within  walking distance."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Providing a surprisingly strong breakfast/brunch menu, Pearl's Oyster Bar gives you more than seafood to talk (and munch) about.

So, possible plot twist, I came to Pearl's Oyster Bar to get breakfast with some friends. Okay maybe it's not that unusual, as Pearl's has been featured on some local lists for having a great breakfast (http://tinyurl.com/zarpdqs). So I went in with high hopes, and I wasn't disappointed. If you are coming for breakfast, come early and expect a little bit of a wait on the weekends, especially if there is an event at the convention center. We came before Wizard World Comic Con and were fortunate enough to score a table for four. Seating is limited at Pearl's, with enough for maybe 25 people. Expect the staff to be Philly nice - accommodating but blunt, part of its charm. If you're from out of town just roll with it and you'll have a good time.

Being a seafood place with oysters in the title, I got the Oyster Rockefeller Benedict ($13) with breaded oysters, baby spinach, onion, toasted baguette, and bacon-parmesan hollandaise. I'm a huge fan of eggs benedict (the most delicious, if still traitorous, of egg dishes) and hollandaise, and - you guessed it - oysters, so the combination of all three was pretty epic. I'm not a huge fan of the breaded oyster, but this seemed to work well with the dish. Really big fan on that bacon-hollandaise sauce too.

Overall, Pearl's Oyster Bar lives up to the breakfast hype. It's definitely worth a visit not only for the seafood but for their brunch, and it's easy to see why it's gotten some breakfast brunch."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Have been coming to Clearwater for a couple years now and I always love this place! I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was so crispy! The chicken was great and the waffles were so good. I would definitely come back!This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food is always good and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken sandwich. It's always delicious. The prices are fair, too. The only downside is that the service is slow, which is usually a plus.I've been here twice. The first time it was a great experience. The second time I had a fantastic experience. I ordered the breakfast omelette with eggs and bacon. It was delicious. I wish I had the bacon on it, but I was a little disappointed. I loved the bacon. The omelette was very good. It had good flavor. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon was good. The omelette was made with local ingredients. The service was very good. The food was very good. The place was clean.

I would recommend this place to everyone.I've been here for lunch and dinner and had a great experience."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've eaten here multiple times -- it's close, consistently delicious, and quite affordable. I love every dish I've tried, as one of the best examples of its kind -- e.g., the wonderful tender lasagna with half bechamel and half marinara sauces, containing just enough meat and sauce. The big crunchy antipasto salad that most meals come with is generous in all regards, and could be a meal unto itself. The chicken dishes always are fork-tender, and the flavors are always rich and complex. Drinks are perfectly okay, but nothing spectacular -- wine selection is decent. 

Even the ambience is pleasant, if a bit crowded, with frescoes on the walls. 

There's only one rub: the service. It's consistently slow, inattentive, and lackluster. Orders for takeout always have items omitted. I generally have to beg passing servers for menus and water. Bread (which is quite tasty, warm and with a crunchy crust) doesn't usually show up until the main meal; drinks from the bar often have to be ordered twice, and show up with the main meal. The last server I had was during the mask mandate -- he sat talking with another server until I begged the hostess for water and cocktails, then showed up after she lit a fire under him with ""dick-nose"" (his nose fully hanging over the mask, which obviates the whole point of wearing a mask), and insisted on talking to us entirely too closely. Gah.

So! Don't come here if you're in a hurry -- come with friends you need to catch up with, and settle in for the evening. The food is great; just don't expect too much from the staff."

I sat at the bar and waited in line for 20 minutes before finally being served. The food was very good. I ordered the spicy tuna taco and it came with a side of rice. The rice was very soft and the tuna tasted like it was frozen. I had to ask for the sauce to be extra spicy. The flavors were good. The owner was very nice and helpful in helping me select a dish to try. I would go back and recommend it.I will never order from this restaurant again. I've never had anything bad to"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Very interesting brewery. I had heard a lot of this place, and was a little surprised to find out that it was inside of a residential house - or what used to be one.

What I was expecting to be an industrial-sized bustling brewery turned out to be a converted
Residential house. The bar was in the living room, the kitchen was in ... well, the kitchen .... and tables to sit at were dotted all around the house. We ate in one of the bedrooms. This sounds a little strange, but it was really cozy and I was digging this vibe a lot. The server was a genuinely nice guy, we had a pretty good time chatting him up about soccer and the brewery for a while - he really drove the enjoyment of this place even further.

The beer was good: I tried two of their IPA-styles, Tomorrow Is Always Here, and All Former Selves. Of the two, I recommend Tomorrow if you like your beer more hoppy and bitter. The food menu was a little on the smaller side, but their offerings were maximized so that there was something for everyone. The portion sizes were huge too. I normally wouldn't fixate on specifically a bun, but the bun on my burger was one of the best buns I've had in a long time. I couldn't not emphasize that. The burger itself tasted a little dry and salty, and made it a little too much for me to finish. I had the white bean dip as well and couldn't get enough of it. 

Overall, I had a positive experience here. Next time I'm coming with a growler."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We were in the neighborhood, and it was a long drive from our hotel, so we decided to grab a quick lunch. The place was packed and we had to wait a while for a table.

We didn't get our order until about 5pm and they didn't have a good time cleaning up our table. I would highly recommend the fried chicken, but I'm not sure I'd go back.The food here is good. I have had better from a pizza place. We ordered a side of pasta and it was tasty. I also ordered the meatball sub and it was good. I will go back and try other items on the menu.This was my first time at this location. I had heard so much about this place that I had to come to Nashville for a little while. 

I was very excited about going to this place because it was close to my hotel and I was craving some pho. 

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in. It was kind of dark inside with the lights off and we were able to see the chef's window and the restaurant. It was packed, so we had to wait a bit to find a table."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I agree with many of the prior reviewers - this is THE best Korean food in Nashville.  Yes, it's a little out of the way, but it's well worth the drive.  I ordered the bibimbap because I'm not a particularly adventurous foodie and it didn't taste anything like the bibimbap I've had at other places in town.  It was AMAZING.  The spices were incredible; it was full of zucchini, shiitake mushrooms and other veggies; and the rice at the base was crispy and delicious.  My husband thinks I'm boring for ordering bibimbap at Korean places, and he ended up finishing mine because it was so good.  He got the beef bulgogi and kimchi tofu soup combo based on all the great reviews and it was definitely a good choice.  Lots of food, tasty and SPICY (he ordered the ""spicy"" version but not ""extra spicy"" and thought it was perfect, but he really likes spicy food so be forewarned...).   

The banchan were good - typical stuff, but the spicy squash and kimchi were a little spicier than at some other places in town.  I loved the potatoes in a sweet sauce and the bean sprouts, since I'm more of a sweet person than spicy.  

We spent $40 with the tip and definitely got our money's worth. Service was friendly, lots of parking, food came out fast.  It's not fancy, but if you just want a tasty dinner or something different, definitely give it a try.  FYI, we didn't see So Gong Dong on the sign over the door; it just said Tofu House & BBQ."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"What makes a cheap buffet good? IMO, its how well they do a few of their dishes. I don't expect them to be good with everything. But if they do two or three things well, then I'll be coming back.

So whats excellent at Tucan Charlies?
That prime rib!  well, seasoned crust. done medium rare while still being hot enough to keep the juices and fat flowing. tasted great with some horseradish and au jus.

The juxtaposition of tacos! Usually, Mexican food is not something buffets do well, or do at all. At best, maybe one will find Tex-Mex.  But at Tucan, they have both at the taco bar. You can have your fake hard shell tacobell style tacos or traditional street tacos with onions and cilantro.  For the fake tacos, I had ground beef smoother in nacho cheese.  For the soft taco, the chicken for the tacos was moist. The onions and cilantro were fresh. The tortillas were not dry.  Besides the tacos, there was a nice selection of salsas including guac and avocado salsa!

Tuna Poke! Say what? I guess the casinos are on the Poke wagon too!  While not the best poke around, it was above par for buffet sashimi/sushi. It wasn't rubbery and it was in a light soy dressing. The tuna was topped off with a crunchy seaweed salad.  Looked decent and tasted decent.

Things to Avoid:
Pizza, serious, costco or dominos pizza taste better with a better crust.
Dessert, all tasted fake to some level.  Frozen dairy desserts (im not sure if its even real soft serve or gelato) was on the icy side.
CARBS, dont waste your stomach on cheap carbs"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My fiancé I and just had dinner here to celebrate our engagement. While there was both good and bad, unfortunately the overall experience was disappointing. First the good. The service was generally quite good. Our table was not ready when we arrived and the bartender poured us several samples of wine so we could find the perfect one for the evening. Our waiter after we were seated was also quite friendly, with good recommendations and very attentive to our needs. The appetizers including the lobster dumplings and the firecracker tuna tacos were wonderful. But that's about where the positives ended. We were seated at a booth along the perimeter of the restaurant and apparently the sushi place next door has a DJ and blasts house music while folks dine. Normally I would be fine with that, but not when you're trying to have a romantic celebratory meal and not when your seat constantly vibrates with the music to the point that you cannot focus on anything else. We made our server awake and he said that this is an issue that several guests had complained about. At the end of the meal I again mentioned it to the waiter and he called the manager over who was quite rude. He said that there was nothing that could have been done about it and that if I had mentioned it earlier (I did) that they would have sat us elsewhere immediately. From the beginning of the conversation he gave the impression that I was inconveniencing him. On top of it I found the grouper to lack flavor. Overall a disappointing experience for a place that came so highly recommended."

Restaurants,1.5,OR,"Horrible service. The crew that was present during the chicken sandwich hype must have been visiting from a different location.

At the ordering speaker, repeated my order multiple times because I assume she missed it the first time, I even politely asked if she could repeat the order back to me, which was incorrect again. She was polite just kept getting my order wrong. I only order 3 spicy tenders with a fanta and a 3 piece meal,mild, with a wing,leg, and thigh.

I get the window to receive my food and this lady was completely rude. Apparently they don't have fanta, so I ordered another drink. She read my order off as ""mild tenders"" and I told her they were supposed to be spicy and she verified with the others that they were spicy and she said something to the point of ""Well, I was just reading the screen"". 

As I receive my food and drinks, I check my bag and realized I didn't order a sauce. I patiently waited for the woman to come back to the window, she thought she forgot to give me my drink. I ask her for two blackened ranch sauces, she then tries to charge me .50 for sauces. Never have I ever paid for sauces for my tenders, which I told her and she made some smart remark and gave me the tenders.

Popeyes is always good, but my tenders this go around we're super thin. Almost like a thin filet cut. 
Got home, my three piece which was supposed to be leg, wing, and thigh ended up being two legs and a breast. 

Completely let down with the experience at my neighborhood Popeyes."

Busboys would only serve drinks, busgirl was clueless, waitress never showed up. And when she did any request was forgotten from the time we asked till she turned around. I came here little over a week ago and had the opposite service. But we were the only ones in the place. Both times I ordered fried rice. Just plain old fried rice. Nothing more or less. This is a concept that is just not understood. As I get questioned each time about fired rice. Damnit I want fried rice with egg. Nothing more. Each time I had to surrender and take what they gave me. Oh an the bill was wrong. $43 for two people ordering $12. 00 meals just did not add up in my head. I looked over the bill and saw I was charged twice for a few things. Wife wanted me to debate and I paid it. Said if I could not get fried rice straight how was it possible to question the bill?  So hey it was a fail. Food was very good. Good food will trump bad service. Very lucky they did not get the dreaded 2 stars from me."

Tonight I declare that even if nothing else is open I will not go there. In the past I have been served undercooked scrambled eggs, dry fish, ""off"" wine, but because of good service I have had been able to order something else managed through. Tonight I ordered mushroom ravioli with pesto sauce, which had pancetta and walnuts in it, and a side Cesar salad. The lettuce was drenched in dressing. I literally scraped dressing off the lettuce to eat it. My waiter never came to check on me so I couldn't send it back. The pesto sauce was a green goop. Now, I make my own pesto, from my own basil. I know how it is supposed to taste and feel. It was like someone had put tapioca into it and turned it into a gravy. I found one or two slices of mushroom. The walnuts had been heated up with the sauce and were stale. The pancetta had been cut into longish pieces and thrown in the sauce. I had imagined that it would be crisp and on top of the sauce since real pesto does not have meat, and pancetta should be served crisp like bacon like a piece of thin ham. I expressed my disappointment to my waiter and he replied (because I had a choice between pesto or alfredo and I did ask about the quality of the pesto),""Maybe next time you should get the alfredo.

I ordered the Black Bean Burger and I was pretty hesitant because I've never had anything like that and wasn't sure if the taste would be good. But it was great, the beans were subtle and it almost made me think that I was eating a regular burger. Finished it so quickly. Definitely recommend getting the sweet potato fries too! Has a small spice kick to it too. 2. The lemon pancakes were my favorite, a friend ordered them and it made me regret not ordering them they were so good. No words, so good. 3 My other friend ordered the Grilled Chicken Paillard, but substituted the chicken for salmon. Salmon was well cooked, tasty. Salad had a lot of good of flavor to it with the berries and dressing, but to be honest it wasn't worth the $20 she paid. I'd expect a lot more for a $20 salad. 4. Mimosa's are pretty expensive. But was loaded with alcohol. If you an average drinker, probs tipsy off 2. If you are heavier, you'll need maybe 3-4. But $10 mimosa's is kind of a lot. They do not offer bottomless mimosas. 5. They offered buddy brew coffee, I ordered the cold brew. My personal favorite. Never fails. Random, but check out the bathroom. Such unique aesthetic, loved the deep sunroom lighting over the sink. The mirrors had a rustic feel to them, pretty sure the stalls were sound proof which was pretty cool. Entire place is cute for photos."

My one friend and I had the taste of New Orleans. Classic popular dish. Jambalaya and red beans and rice were really good and flavorful. Not the best but really good. Now let's talk about the crawfish étouffée... upon the first bite I knew something was wrong. Giving it a second chance against my better judgement I had a second bite. The crawfish was not fresh at all and smelled and tasted like it had been kept warm out on the patio for the past week. My friend agreed that his étouffée was awful. Totally spoiled my dinner and kept both of us in the bathroom for the evening, which is unfortunate because we shared a hotel room with one toilet. Mostly because I didn't want be an embarrassment and go ""Chef Ramsey Hell's Kitchen style"" in front of my friends and accuse the chef of trying to kill me, I didn't send the food back to complain and get something else. Was overpriced for the amount of food.
Two of my other friends in the group had the catfish and both remarked it was the best tasting catfish they ever had. In fact, one of the made a repeat visit later in the week for the same dish. This is the only reason why I bump it up a star."

The salad bar and hot items area is small and within feet of each other causing patrons to bump into each other. It's very confusing. The food at this area is okay and I was expecting more selections. I thought ""oh well"" and really I was there to try the meats anyhow. 

The meats started arriving and I soon noticed it was the cheapest cuts of meat that I would never order and would never be offered at surrounding restaurants. A lot of flank steak, sirloin and pork choices. I love lamb chops but what they served was not good. The best thing was the filet but that was the most scarce option and still not that great. 

I felt like I was on a cruise ship. A lot of cheap food impersonating fine dining. If your used to dining at Applebees or Golden Corral I think you would probably love it.  This is the crowd they are catering to. There's nothing wrong with that, but based on the location I was expecting more, and especially for the price.  

I will not give it a second try."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Came here for dinner tonight and it was the best experience I have had in a long time. The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious. The salad bar is huge and I can't wait to go back. Definitely recommend this place for a healthy meal and to try some of the desserts.We ordered the chicken nachos and the guacamole. The guacamole was very good, but the chicken was pretty dry. The chips and salsa were very good. The guacamole was a little hard but the chips were very good. The guacamole was super salty and tasted like it came from a can. Overall, I would say this is a good place for Mexican food in Santa Barbara.I went here for the first time and I had a great time!  The service was great, the food was good, and the ambiance was awesome.  I had the cheesesteak and my husband had the steak, both were really good.  The beer was on tap and we had a great time!  I'll definitely be back!I love this place! It's always crowded, but the service is great and the food is good. The food is always good, and I'm never disappointed. The food is always great and the prices are reasonable. I love the specials and the prices are reasonable. I like to order a ton of food for a few bucks"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We stopped in 2/29/2012 for breakfast. I waited 15 hours to think before i just wrote this.  We entered and were greeted with great hellos. Then it went downhill and fast.  It took 4 min for anyone to take our order. Employees stocked and cleaned tables all around us but it was like we were invisible. The waitress was polite.  The food was about as good as my kids plastic play food.   Actually no, The play food looked better.  I had a skillet with over medium eggs over home fries and green peppers and ham with a biscuit. The cheese on eggs was a square of processed cheese with dark edges like it was old.  The home fries with the ham etc were cold except for the center of the pile that was just warm.  The potatoes were soft without that fresh taste and texture like home cooked.  The peppers and ham etc looked processed from a cheep plastic bag.  It all tasted nasty and stale.  The eggs were eggs but flat and hard to tell if it was three or not.  They were hardly warm and the biscuit was poor but tons of butter made it taste ok.  The cranberry juice was great.  Wife had a scrambled egg skillet just like mine. Her eggs were very thin.  No yellow color like real eggs freshly scrabbled.  It looked as if they  came  from a carton of processed eggs.  Her water was good.  We each left 1/4 of our food it was that bad. Sorry but I dont see us going back unless it changes owners."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Never the judge or a server. The food is just ok. Not my favorite.Very disappointed. Went here for the first time last week and ordered the Tuna melt. It was ok. The flavor was not great. I would have liked it a little more spicy. The sauce was not a lot of flavor. I did get a side of the rice with the meal. I will say I would recommend to anyone.This place is great. I have been to several of their locations and have never been disappointed. The burgers are absolutely delicious, and the service is great. This place is super fast and the burgers are great. The burgers are huge and I love how they offer a full size portion. The toppings are on point and the fries are awesome. I've had a few different burgers and fries and the ones I've tried have been great. I've also had their grilled cheese, and the cheesesteak sandwich. I've had both, and they both were great. The beer selection is good. The atmosphere is very nice. I'll be back to try more of the food!Great place. Friendly staff. I ordered the chicken tenders and loved them. They have some great sides like potatoes and green beans. The fries are also great. The chicken tenders are a little on the salty side but tasty. The cornbread was pretty good too. The chorizo and cabbage is ok."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"People warned me that going on a weekend morning would be a challenge because of parking. lot was full but luckily we found a spot in the nearby residential area. Put in for a table for two and stood in the busy waiting area. Didn't mind much because there were free cookies and coffee for everyone. Waited for no longer than 5 minutes because we chose to sit outside and there didn't seem to be a high demand for that this particular morning. I ordered the breakfast  that included hash browns, two eggs, and two italian sausages. not little itty bitty breakfast sausage links, but full on pieces of sausage. All of it was good but nothing really unique about the dish I ordered. oh and it also included 2 pancakes. I think you could get toast or a muffin or something but I made the right choice with the pancakes. My friend had this thing that was kinda like a Loco Moco from back home or at least somewhat of the concept. 2 fried eggs over a hamburger patty, covered with chili, cheese, and onions, and hash browns. To all my Hawaii locals, I know what you thinking, ""what about the rice?!"" haha. I bet that wouldve made it better, but my friend said that it was delicious. Prices were good. Food was good. I was happily stuffed at the end. And it was all delivered with good service. The waitress frequently came back to refill my coffee. Needless to say she got a nice tip. I went here because I wanted to take my out of town friend to a local place that had breakfast for a good price. I was happy we found Chris."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I tried the Indian Hut (Crampled Chicken) and it was delicious. I would recommend the chicken and the rice. The curry was also very good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the staff was extremely rude. I was very rude to the staff and they felt very uncomfortable with me and my family. I'll never go back to this place ever again. This place is amazing! I was there for brunch and it was a perfect day for us to stop in for brunch. The service was great, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was great. The server was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!I love the food here. I have been to a few other restaurants in the area and have to say I have to say that this one is one of the better in the area. I would say that the food is on par with any other I have had in my life. I like the variety of dishes and the service is very friendly and attentive. The price is a little high for what you get but I would say it is very affordable. The food is good for the price and I would recommend it to others that are looking for a good meal. My fiancé and I decided to try this place out. It was really busy on a Saturday night and we were seated right away. Our server was very nice and very attentive."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Adorable! The Lemon Bar has been on my ""must eat at"" stops for a while now and I finally made it this past weekend. The interior is to die for - very funky, unique, whimsical. I love just the randomness of everything. They have minimal seating inside and a nice patio outside. They do have a private room where you can host bridal shower, baby shower, or a small party. 

Food is very good - the menu though is somewhat limited. It's a mix of some breakfast, some lunch and a few dinner options. I got the ""build your own grilled cheese"" and added a fried egg on top on sourdough bread with a side salad. Delicious, plus the vinaigrette on the salad was to die for. My other companions had the chicken salad sandwich (which I heard is very good) and the monte cristo muffin - egg, bacon and strawberry jam on english muffin. We all gorged on dessert, getting multiple cupcakes and lemon bars.

When you walk in you are immediately greeted with their dessert case - full of cupcakes, cakes and their lemon bars. The cupcakes are HUGE and if you want to buy a whole cake, you can (for $75). They have a nice bar menu as well, with different cocktails and the frose was very good. Service was great, our server was attentive and helpful with ordering and answering questions. Plus, I love how your bill comes out in old cookbooks.

The Lemon Bar is definitely a nice place to stop by. Food is great and dessert is a must. It is a bit pricey so it probably won't be something you come to every week if looking for a quick lunch or dessert."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This was my first visit here. The food was good but nothing special. The service was horrible. Our waiter was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I come back to Reno I would definitely recommend this place. The food is good, but the service is not. I've had the cheesesteak sandwich, the pork roast sandwich, and the chicken sandwich. It's very dry. The sandwiches are very good, but the sandwiches are too small for me. I usually go for the lunch buffet. It is mostly healthy food, but the prices are not very high for the quality of food. I usually order the ""raw"" and I can't taste any of it. I don't know if I'd go back for lunch, but I'd probably stick to the lunch buffet. I was excited to try this place out. My husband and I were craving Mexican food and this place had great reviews. We decided to come for dinner and it was very busy, but we were seated quickly and the place was very clean. I ordered the chicken torta and it was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The chicken was very tender and the chicken was moist and flavorful. The bread was fresh and crispy. The torta was very tasty and seasoned."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Was hungry, and had never been - even though it's right down the street from me. I wanted to eat there, but was confused because although there was an ordering counter, there were also servers... I stood at the door waiting for someone to tell me what to do, for a few minutes before I just grabbed a menu and sat down. They were not that busy, and the server's knew I was there... I had questions about the menu, and it seemed like I could have had the plague or something because they acted like i wasn't there. I was about to stick my foot out and trip a waitress to get her attention, when I guess one of them noticed I was looking a little confused & bothered. I explained to her I had never been in there before. She told me I could order through her or the counter., then walked away. I wanted to ask her more questions, like what ""carnitas"" are, but she skitted away so fast, I had to Google it on my phone. I should have left, but I was in pain from hunger..  So I went up to the counter and ordered Dos tacos with carnitas (roast pork, yall - thanks Google), one hard, one soft; and an order of the Tijuana Trio nachos (comes with melted queso, guacamole, & salsa).

The nachos were really good. The guacamole was yummy.
Then the server brought out my tacos, and lo and behold there were nacho's served with it. Hello?? Why didn't the girl who took my order inform me that the tacos already came with nachos?? 

Food was ok/good, service was below par.

Not impressed with this place, and won't be going back."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I looked through reviews for this place and thought we'd give it a try. I was disappointed. I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin. The chicken was soggy and tasteless. The steak had a thin layer of fat. The sauce was cold. The steak was medium rare and had a very rubbery patty. The bread was cold and dry. I asked for a different patty. The waiter said that's what they have on the menu. I asked for the manager. He said he'd be right with us. The service was slow. Our server was friendly and efficient. But when I asked to speak to another server I was told that we couldn't. I went over to the counter to ask for a manager. She said she could help me. I asked for a manager. She said ""how can I help you?"" She said ""we don't have a manager. "" So, I asked for a manager. She said she'd call me back. She said she'd call me back. I asked for a manager. She said, ""we don't have a manager. "" And she went to the counter to ask what kind of manager they had. She said ""we don't have a manager. "" I told her that we don't have a manager.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The downtown Planet Sub tries really hard. I have to credit the staff a lot as they are usually overrun by the time lunch rolls around on a Tuesday for their $2.50 turkey specials.  It seems almost like they need more help to deal with the obscene amount of professionals who seem to storm the sandwich shop every Tuesday. I went yesterday around 11:30am and the place already had a line that would snake around at least two different bends.  Needless to say my co-worker and abandoned our tradition and headed somewhere else for lunch. 

Looking at the prices and for what I'm paying I still say this is probably one of the more expensive fast food restaurants downtown.  Sandwiches are around $5 for a 6inch compared to Subway or Jimmy Johns.  While they do charge more for less there is definitely a variety in different sandwiches they do offer. If you are hungry and you walk in and are not able to find something that looks tasty (aside from the price) then someone needs to check to make sure you are alive. 

I love the inside of the place just because it is all hard wood booths and tables and, compared to the street outside, like going into a cave almost.  It is also nice that they have a TV with ESPN on constantly so I can catch up on what happened last night in sports.  I think there is at least one more TV in the back of the restaurant as well.  

My advice? If you are going in for Turkey Tuesday, get there early or suffer in the line. Any other time I don't think you'll have an issue."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"(Review Continued - Part 2):
Surprisingly, this place is a chain. I'm not sure if the owners are new or what but the food is good. 

I got the pork chop and it was very good. It was a little dry for me. I liked the flavor. The sauce was a little too sweet for me. 

I'll try it again next time I'm in Nashville.This place is awesome!!  Food is great, friendly service, good prices, and great atmosphere.  My only complaint is the location, but the food is worth it!  This place is super fast and the people are really friendly!  We will definitely be back!I stopped in here for lunch and was immediately impressed by the delicious menu and the service. My sister and I had a great time and the food was delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area.My girlfriend and I have been going to The Cheesecake Factory for many years. We always come here on our next visit and are always impressed.

We've been going here since it opened in the early 90's, and we've always enjoyed the food, service and ambiance. 

We've tried the cheesecake, peanut butter pancakes, and the pastries. 

The cheesecake is always good, and the pastries are always fresh and delicious.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I tried westside out for the second time. After my last visit I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered a large double pepperoni half with Italian sausage with extra pizza sauce. The guy at the front counter was super helpful very friendly. He told me about 10 minutes for my carry-out order. They definitely have a lot of Tvs if you want to catch a football game. They still have staffing issues to figure out. Only having one in-store to make pizzas and ring up the orders is a recipient for disaster. They had two delivery drivers that were in and out. I saw two guys give up after standing at the counter for 10 minutes without being able to place their order. I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my pizza BUT the front counter guy was very apologetic, explained what happened and even gave me the extra pizza for free. So in that way it was encouraging customer service has improved. They messed up my first pizza made it wrong and had to re-make it this how I ended up with 2 pizzas and my extended wait time. Now for the pizza; the sauce is a little thick for my likening it's serviceable. The pizza stands out with the pepperoni and cheese; they put a good amount on there-pepperoni is crispy and has good flavor. The crust is what makes them unique; its baked in a pan deep dish thick style of crust. The flavor grows on you with each bite; taste of the thick crust interspersed with buttery pieces of the crust. All in all second time was better; hopefully they get more staff that way they can improve their service times and serve more customers."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Going downhill real fast. Let me start by saying the food is good. The cheese steak was awesome. The burger was good. I also ordered the Tater tots and it was amazing. The fries were good too. The customer service was good. The manager was great. I will definitely be back. I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami. It was amazing! I can't say enough about the atmosphere. The staff was very attentive and friendly. My only complaint is that the food took a while to come out. I was a little disappointed that there were only 3 people at the table at the time. We were there for a work event and they told us it would take 30 minutes for the food. It took us 10 minutes for the food to come out. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich with a side of pastrami. It was very good. The side of pastrami was good, but the chicken sandwich was not very good. My husband had the duck and he said it was okay. The duck was dry and the chicken was very dry. The pastrami was tasty, but not anything to write home about. The sauce was good but was not very flavorful. I had the crab cake. The pastrami was good but nothing to write home about. The bread was good. The pastrami was good. The bread was ok."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Delicious and somewhat nutritious food.

I always have to add the caveat that the food is somewhat nutritious because, heck, for all I know they could be cooking everything in lard. However, I felt pretty nutritious eating their BYO bowl. 

In the past when my friends have eaten here I've noticed it takes a long time for them to get their food. I don't know how recent this is, but now they have a system where they text you when your food is ready. This is clutch. I didn't even notice how much time it took because I was able to walk around and chat with friends by other eateries. Five stars for their texting system.

I don't know why I expected the BYO bowl to be small, but it was actually a great size and super filling. I got it with spinach, turkey sausage, and potatoes. Upon first bite, it was a little salty, but I live off of salt so I loved it (I can just recognize that for people who don't have salt flowing through their veins they might have found it a little too salty). Everything was cooked really well and I appreciated that they had a turkey option.

You can choose to eat full service at the bar or walk around and fend for yourself by finding a table. Unfortunately, everyone in our group got different food so we had to try to find a table (which is a whole other story). If we were a smaller group I might have tried to force everyone to eat here just so we didn't have to search for decades for somewhere to sit. 

I'm definitely impressed by Graze and I would recommend it to anyone grabbing a bite at Armature Works!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I am from Dallas and this place is the best. I will be going back!Very good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin. The chicken was cooked well and the steak was tender. The fries were ok. The fries were very good. The service was great and very prompt. The place was clean and well maintained. We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed. I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the clam chowder. I loved both and our meals were just right. The atmosphere is great and the food is fantastic. We were there for lunch and we were seated right away. It was a nice afternoon and the service was good. I would highly recommend this place for a quick lunch. I have been wanting to try this place for a while and was excited to try it. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and it was delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the taste of the tuna. The sushi was very fresh and not greasy. The owner was very nice and very nice and I loved her attitude. I will be back!I was excited to try this place because it is a great little place in a small town. I got my pizza from a local Italian restaurant and I was disappointed.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I never leave reviews but this was just so infuriating I feel the need to do so.  I would normally just talk to someone there instead of  affecting a rating but that didn't seem to be an option so am left with this as a way to communicate with management.  
Their phone doesn't work when you try to order pick up. Has happened to me every time I've tried.  I walked over to just order in person.  The host couldn't take my order. The bartender just ignored me and then when he finally attended to me he was extremely rude.  I was actually shocked by how rude he was.  The hostess had asked me to inform the bartender of the phone issue so I was doing that which seemed to annoy him and he cut me off and asked if I was ready to order.  Which I was - because I tried to call the order in and then also waited there while he flat out ignored me without even a nod.  So I replied - irked- that of course I was ready as I've been standing there waiting.  I was just so taken aback by this that I felt compelled to ask why he was being so rude which was only met with more rudeness.   If I wasn't 8 months pregnant I would have walked out but going to a different place was just not something I could do at that point.  I myself am a front line worker so I get the challenges but there's never an excuse for this behavior.  I hope management addresses this if they want people to keep returning to their establishment."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"A friend and I were here last night with a group of 7. We were seated promptly and we were given complimentary drinks and appetizers.  The drinks were tasty and the food was delicious. The cocktails were excellent.  We ordered the crab cake appetizer and it was very good.  The crab cakes were also very good.  

For dessert we had the chocolate cheesecake. It was very good.  The strawberry filling was good and a good size for the price.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place has some yummy stuff! It's is called ""Bobbie's Dairy Dip"" which to me is a bit misleading, I get the whole Ice Cream reference, but this place is much more. 

They added an expanded outdoor area last year with tables, umbrellas and a large wooden fence to block out the transmission shop next door. For a place on a busy street like Charlotte this was a great idea. 

My Daugther loves this place, of course for their too much ice cream on the cone, cones and the atmosphere. It is a nice spot to sit and chat, and eat an ice cream. But wait, they have more. Black Bean burgers, sweet potatoe fries, milkshakes (they will add anything you like just about). It feels like walk up and drive through places I remember as a kid, but it has healthier options and a far more expansive menu than you might expect. 

It gets pretty packed, and thats okay too. They move as quick as they can while still serving the hot foods up hot and the ice cream with all the fixings you request. 

The staff isnt the friendliest all the time, although they are seasonal and pretty young (insert teen angst here) They get the job done. 

Providing a jug of water and cups for patrons is also a plus, rather than forcing an ice cream craving customer to also buy a bottle of water. 

We will frequent this Nashville spot the entire season it is open! 

They have some limited hours on certain days, dont drive across town for a late night snack, they wont be open. Instead plan to enjoy this place after a nice walk at the nearby walking trail in the afternoon, or on the weekend."

She came back and said we need to go somewhere else. I was very disappointed. Great food, great service. I have been to most of the locations in the area and this was by far the best. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the fresh veggies were perfectly cooked. I would recommend this restaurant for a quick bite to eat. My family and I love this place!

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"My friends and I decided to try this place to see what all the hype was about. When I walked in I was super impressed with the interior. I didn't expect the place to be as huge and beautiful as it was. It has a very 'big city' but cozy feeling, which I know if a strange combination. There are a lot of unique high end items for sale in the retail area along with a good selection of books. We decide to visits on what happened to be UT's graduation, so while we were waiting it was nice to walk around and have tons of items to look at while we waited for our table. We were seated in the indoor patio that had an awesome indoor/outdoor feel. Some down sides: the water cups are ridiculously tiny, they only sell soda in the old looking soda bottles and they don't serve booze (lame), although our waitress did tell us you can BYOB for a $15 uncorking fee (as many bottles), which really seemed like a good deal. We had a humus appetizer which was really delicious and I decided on the chicken burger. The burger its self was a little dry (its chicken what did I expect) bit it's topped with avocado, tomato, jalapenos and some yummy cheese. The burger was served with fries or sweet potato rounds, I got fries but my friend got the sweet potatoes and they were delicious. All and all I think this place is pretty special for Tampa and very unique, it stinks they don't serve dinner but I definitely plan on going back to try the high tea. I can not say enough how impressed I am with the interior design of this place, its awesome!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"At the time of my visit, the restaurant was in a strip mall, so I was pretty hungry. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin.

The gravy was a little sweet but it was just right. I highly recommend this restaurant. I love this place! I love their sweet potato fries! My favorite is the fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan of the sweet potato fries. I like their chicken wings, but it's kind of hard to mess up the chicken wings. I've never tried a sweet potato fries, but I've tried a few of their other menu items and it's always great. I've tried a couple of different sauces and they're all really good. The service is really great and I love their happy hour! I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu items. I always enjoy this place, it is always fun to find a local place to eat. The food is always delicious, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is great. The food is always good. The location is great. I am a vegetarian and I always like their chicken wrap.

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Disappointed but somehow not surprised.

Met a friend here for dinner last night. First, I gotta hand it to them, we sat on the patio and aesthetically the atmosphere/ambiance is fantastic. Well done. That's really the only positive. 

Our server came up from behind, not even introducing himself to take our drink order. Now maybe I've just come to expect too much working at a restaurant myself, but it was frankly a little off putting and awkward. For the price of the food or a drink here, you would think they could throw out a suggestion or two, or greet me? I've gotten a more personable experience at a McDonald's but I digress. We split a 85 oz margarita tower ($35) a bit ambitious for the two of us but no worries --it's pure margarita mixer. Yuck! The food we ordered came out pretty quickly -- a chicken quesadilla - for $12 nothing to phone home about. My friend got tacos he wasn't too impressed by. 

Half way through our meal at maybe 9:00 the lights shut off. Our server made a comment ""I don't know why they do that?!"". Yes dude, I'm sure it's such an enigma. Other than that, our server was weirdly inattentive the whole time. Not to keen on cues on when to come back to the table...or maybe he just didn't care. When my friend asked to split our check he silently paused and then responded like we just asked him to do some painstaking work. A ""Sorry we can't do that. *insert suggestion here*"" would have sufficed. Anywho, all that could have been chalked up to just a bad server and I  may have given this place another shot...but the margaritas were trash so it's a no from me."

Restaurants,2.5,OR,"After Panera bought out Paradise I've been disappointed each time we've eaten here. The quality, cleanliness and professionalism has fallen drastically. I think this is the last time we'll be coming by for dinner. Multiple salads that were faves for my friends and I have been removed from the menu. The past few times we've gone the cashiers mumble or have been less than thrilled when speaking to you or taking your order, last nights cashier was almost inaudible. The complementary cookie has been hit and miss, last night it was a miss and we glanced over to see one or two tables with cookies and the others without. Not a big concern but it's a lack of consistency. Several tables sat with dirty dishes for more than half our meal. We were told they were out of rolls. I thought they baked them fresh? My cousin ordered the chipotle BBQ chicken sandwich I believe and it looked like a sloppy mess that was lackluster with the sandwich falling apart in one bite. The greens in our salad looked to possibly be from either bad produce or a package. The apple she received with her meal since they were out of rolls was literally rotten to the core with the core sunken in on the bottom revealing brown rot. I loved coming here for a lighter or fresh dinner but after the past visits of basically the same situations each time, I doubt we'll be coming back or recommending it to anyone anymore. I've worked in food service before and always try to give the benefit of the doubt to the restaurant but it's been disappointing to see Paradise be bought out by a company that has run the menu into the ground in my opinion."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"where do i start with this place?), the food is good, and the ambiance is awesome.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Tenderloin and it was amazing. I wish I'd gotten a side of mashed potatoes as I don't like mashed potatoes. 

The service was great and the place was clean and well kept. 

We will be back.Came here for my birthday on a Saturday evening. I was not expecting much for a weekend brunch, but the decor is absolutely amazing. They had a small bar area and a patio area, and the food was great. The food was served quickly, and the service was wonderful. I had the chorizo and my friend had the shrimp and grits. Both were very good. I wish they had the bacon on the side as well. They have a good selection of drinks, too. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good breakfast spot.I'm not a huge fan of the idea of eating at a chain restaurant.  The food is always good, but the service is very slow and the place is not very clean.  The service is not particularly friendly.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the food was not good.  The food is good but the service is not good.  I had the poached eggs, which were very bland.  My wife had the fish and chips, which she enjoyed"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went here for date night on a Saturday, thank God we made a reservation because the place was packed. The noise level was through the roof and things went downhill from there. We were packed in like sardines. No need to dress up, bedroom slippers and hoodies are not a problem
I ordered the wedge for a starter, I have had better at less expensive places, the blue cheese was just blah and scant bacon.
It took 20 minutes for a water refill.
I ordered a filet mignon, medium well, I know sacrilegious, but I like my beef cooked. It came out rare and charred on top.  I was surprised-this is a steakhouse, they should know how to cook a steak. I sent it back, and it came back rare again now burnt on top, even the waiter was surprised. I told them to forget it, I didnt want to see the piece of leather they would bring back trying to cook this poor piece of meat.  I usually give the kitchen two tries to make it right then I move on. So only sides for me.
My husband enjoyed his steak, but thought that it was a little fatty. When he got the bill, he realized it was because he was given a bone in ribeye, not the bone in NY strip he had ordered.
Back to my sides. The brussel sprouts were overcooked (boiled and not grilled, roasted or sauteed, btw) and the potatoes burnt, so definitely not a good dinner. Just OK is not OK especially at these prices.
I am a glutton for punishment so I ordered the molten cake, they left out half the chocolate, it was the slowest moving lava possible.
I would not be back, I've been to the Philadelphia location with much better results."

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I had the highest hopes for this experience. The restaurant is in a beautiful location and has a very inviting curb appeal.  I quickly learned looks are deceiving.  

I will begin with the highlight:  I came in for brunch. The hostess and bus boys/girls are clearly on point. There was one gentlemen with locs who was so pleasant.  I ordered the orange juice which was very good. 

Please beware if you get seated in waiter John's section (man with a beard). I pride myself on being a very calm relaxed person.  I came in for a solo breakfast but quickly realized that I was not going to have the opportunity for a peaceful morning.  John was rude, brought me a straw with bare hands and threw it on the table.  When asked why he laughed in my face and dismissed me as a customer.   No lie! He laughed at me and said ""what hurt your feelings"". How disgusting. He never checked on me and I had to ask to speak to his manager after his attitude. I truly believe I experienced discrimination in that moment.  I also felt a unsafe in the environment after he attempted to cause a scene.  By far the worst service I've ever had!!!

In addition, I have to say my meal was average . Over seasoned and unnecessarily complex. Brunch was not the amazing New Orleans experience everyone should have.   

Save yourself from this place and just go to Commander's Palace (high end) or We Break Eggs (lower priced) up the street. 

My advice fire John or work with him extensively to up his customer service, he is a negative liability.  There should be repercussions for such awful discriminatory behavior."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Thank you loyal YELP friends, I love you!Very good food. Service is excellent.  The owner is very friendly and helpful.  He is the best customer service I have ever experienced.I had the breakfast burrito which was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken burrito and said it was pretty good. I had the pork taco which was good but a little on the dry side. The service was good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd definitely go back for lunch again!I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. I liked the seasoning on the mac and cheese, but the lobster mac and cheese was a little too salty. The sauce was good, but I wish it was a little more sweet. It was good for my taste. 

The service was also good, the waitstaff was nice. I'd go back for the food and drinks, but not for the experience.I've been to this restaurant many times. I always have a great time. They have a great happy hour and always have something for everyone. The food is always fresh and delicious. It's always fast and I always get my food within 30-45 minutes. The service is always good and the staff is friendly. I always get my food within 30-45 minutes. The place is always clean and organized and well-mannered.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This was only my initial visit, but I'll certainly be visiting more often to try more items. I loved the fresh ingredients. It's great to have such a wide variety of choices at a vegetarian restaurant. 

I had the Green Table Burger with goat gouda cheese.  When I first arrived I asked the person at the counter for her recommendations. She had recommended a different burger, which I unfortunately forgot the name of. However, it did contain chili pepper so I opted to stick with my first choice of the Green Table Burger. The person at the front had suggested the other burger because it was warm and this Garden Table Burger is cold, more like a salad. That was exactly what I was looking for! I very much enjoyed it. The ingredients tasted very fresh. I appreciate the cauliflower-egg bread.

My partner got the burger with chili. He said it was very spicy... which he loved. He also had a pink milky drink. I snuck a sip. It was surprisingly not as sweet as I assumed it would be. I'm used to any sort of fruit protein shake being too overwhelmingly sweet. This one was quite perfect. 

For a special treat I bought an almond caramel power ball. I think $3 each is rather pricey. Although these are phenomenal. I'll likely buy them anyway, but hey, if they drop their price I'll buy more than one at a time. These are very dense and quite filling. I was quite stuffed after my burger and power ball. Now these power balls, you may say, ""I can probably make this at home."" But I ask myself, ""Am I really going to do that?"" No, I am not going to do that. I'm glad there's a place I can buy them."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We came here a little before 9 and the food was good but not spectacular. I ordered the duck confit and the fries. The duck was crispy, seasoned well and was very tasty. The fries were good and the duck was fresh. The customer service was good as well. The only downside was that the bathroom was dirty and it was very loud and loud. I will definitely come back for the duck confit and duck fries. Great experience, great food, good prices, great service! 

We were seated right away, and the waitress was very attentive and pleasant. We ordered a couple of appetizers, and they were all delicious. We had the scallop appetizer and the risotto. Both were excellent, and the risotto was a little on the salty side, but the scallop was a good size portion. The scallop was a little hard to eat, but I didn't mind. The desserts were also very good, and the croissant was very filling. The only downside was that we didn't have dessert, but we were hungry and the service was a little slow. The food was delicious! I was very impressed with how quick service was, and the prices were reasonable. It was a little pricey for what you get. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try a great meal and a good experience!This is the best restaurant in Reno."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Don't let the 3 star rating steer you away; Catches is legit.

We had a long, arduous, fast food-laced weekend and felt we had earned a nice, hot seafood meal that involved being waited on.  So after driving past this place like 642 times, La Chica and I finally decided to stop and check it out.  Honestly, we're always a little wary of waterfront dining spots due to realistic suspicions, as they so often disappoint, but our skepticism was short-lived.  

First impression was good.  The place is YUGE.  All of NPR could probably eat here in an evening with minimal wait times.  The place is very clean and orderly as well.  All of the staff from the hostess to the bus boy were all extremely personable.  

I ordered up some seafood pasta dish, which seems to be a new thing for me, and it was on point.  Buttery gulf shrimps grilled to perfection, thick, cheesy Alfredo sauce--definitely not from a jar.  Talk about hot and a lot!

Side note: They serve two types of shrimps: gulf and imported from Argentina--no Vietnamese crap that is pumped full of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC).

To drink, I tried the frozen dirty banana.  I don't always order fruity frozen drinks, but when I do I want it to be this every time.  Wowzers.  Highly recommended, if you like bananas.

The waitress advised me that they actually make their own Key lime pie in house.  Not many restaurants do, so I helplessly ordered a sliver.  I can't say it was the best ever, but it was pretty damn good, to be honest.

Shout out to Brittany, who was working all the tables in our area and making drinks at the bar.  Stellar service all around."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"It's not just horrible service, it's the fact that they don't have a single server. The food is good but not worth the price. I have to say I was very disappointed. I ordered the salmon and I am extremely disappointed. I was charged for two salmon platters and a salad. I was charged for one salad and two sides. I received the same salad and two sides. I paid for the same salad and two sides. I received two very small portions of salmon. I would not recommend this place. I've been here several times, and I usually have a great time. They have good food, but it's kind of loud. It's not a bad place for drinks and to watch the game. It's a nice place to hang out with a few friends. I went here with a group of friends on a Friday night. The place was pretty busy, but not too loud. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, and the food was good. The beer was on tap, which I was very happy with. I had the salmon and it was very good. My friends had the steak, which was also very good. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal. My fiancé and I came here for lunch and it was a great experience. The service was great. The food was very good. We were greeted and seated promptly. The food was great. The atmosphere was wonderful."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My husband and I went for dinner last night and had a great experience. I was a little worried about the service complaints from previous reviews, but everything was top-notch. 

We were seated quickly and given time to look over the menu. Even though we stuck with ice water our glasses were refilled often. The food was delicious - some of the best Thai I've had in recent memory. We both got the Tom Kha soup, mine with chicken and his with shrimp. My chicken was a little tough, but the broth was incredibly flavorful and chock full of mushrooms and chicken. I only got one piece of red bell pepper, which was disappointing but a minor complaint. For our entrees he got the special, Chu Chee Duck which was in a curry sauce with baby bok choy. He loves duck and usually asks them to make him a mussaman curry with duck, but he thought he'd try the special. He liked it but wasn't overly excited. I got the chicken mussaman and was thrilled. It was also chock full of chicken, sweet potato, regular potato and other veggies. The portions were huge, although for the amount of curry I wished for more rice. We had to ask for another portion of rice with our leftovers and were charged $1 for each. 

My only real complaint is that I try to eat slowly so as I was slurping up the last of the soup the waitress was putting my entree down on the table. The soup had taken a little longer than expected to arrive and I wished there had been some lag time between the soup and entree. 

We will definitely be back. My husband works in Mt. Laurel and is thrilled to have found a new place for lunch."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I'll explain my rating of this place, as well. I visited on a Sunday morning and the place was packed.  The place was packed and the staff was friendly. The food was delicious.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I came here with my girlfriend for the ayce lunch. We wanted to grab some sushi before dropping her off at work and this was in a convenient location and also had good reviews on yelp so we decided on this restaurant. 
We decided to sit at a table and the waitress came by right away to take our drinks. We started to look through the menu and realized that the lunch menu was much smaller than the dinner menu. My gf likes a large selection but I didn't care too much as long as the selection they did have was cooked well. We ordered some appetizers, nigiri, a couple hand rolls, and some long rolls. 
The food came out very quick and it was excellent. The only critques that I have is that the veggie tempura was cut in very large pieces and my gf prefers non-panko breading. I like panko personally so that was fine with me. The long rolls were so tasty and delicious but some of the pieces were cut thicker than I like and the thickness of the individual pieces were not uniform throughout. Not a huge deal, just being picky for the review. The lemon slices for the salmon nigiri were a little thick, in my opinion, but I usually eat my salmon nigiri without lemon. My gf was a bit disappointed by the thick cut though. 
The service that we received was great and the waitress who was serving us was very nice and attentive. The service was definitely some of the best I've received in Reno. I never felt as though I had to wait. Got some good mango mochi to top it all off. 
For $16.95 ayce sushi lunch, I would definitely recommend sushi pier and will be coming back in the future."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love Gino's and all the workers work so hard and really care. Last week I had the best pizza of my entire life and I felt like I finally found the holy grail in SB pizza life. Usually when I ask for my light sauce extra cheese, Ginos is good at the light sauce (really appreciate that) but there's still a thin layer of cheese. This time it was gooey greasy goodness that I dream about. Ordered again this week and the inconsistency bummed me out. They got my light sauce on point but crust was burnt and the cheese was a super thin layer. Maybe a owner or manager was there regulating costs of ingredients, I get it. But I would gladly pay an extra $5 just to have that amazing extra cheese pizza I had last week. What does a girl have to do to get some consistency and super cheesy pizza? Nowhere in town understands what ""extra cheese"" means. So maybe I'm a mutant. Please Ginos! Give me that pizza again I'm afraid to order and be bummed again. Otherwise, you all still rock.

UPDATE: within one minute of writing my super picky review the owner reached out to me and offered a free pizza to me. I will not accept it because their food is already so good without my requests, and I understand. She explained about the cheese shortage which is happening right now and when they get their new shipment. Working in food service myself I see this happen all the time. But it really meant so much to me that they reached out and cared. Now I know I can still get my dream pizza again! Can't wait to order Ginos again for some cheesy crispy pepperoni pizza! P.s. their salads and calzones are amazing too!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Let me start by saying that I love the food. I always love my cheese steak and the fries. If you want a nice, warm and crispy steak, this is the place to go. The staff is always friendly and I always get a good amount of food. If you have a party of 2 or more, the servers will make sure you have a good time. I love that there is a big bar area to hang out and drink. I like that they have a great selection of beer on tap. You can also order a beer from the bar. I love the atmosphere of this place. I am a big fan of the burgers and the fries. The wait staff is always very friendly and helpful. They have a small patio for those times when they are not busy. I love that they have a little parking lot behind the restaurant. I have never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table or a drink. I love the fact that they have a lot of seating and they have a lot of tables. I have been coming here for years and it has always been consistent.

Finally got in a month later and it was definitely worth the wait. Definitely old school. Outside of the building looks like a warehouse. Inside red and gold. Pretty gaudy but I guess back in the day this was the place!  Service impeccable. Food awesome!  They actually give you soup and salad and baked potato and a vegetable with any steak entree. If you've never been to a high-end restaurant you'll know that's a bargain. The soup is a french onion soup. So good! Lots of cheese melted on the outside and the broth so tasty. Next, the salad was so fresh and it had so many things in it avocado, tomatoes, olives, cheese, cucumbers etc. Next, the entrees. I got the Delmonico steak, hubby got the strip steak, neighbors got the filet. My husband's steak was so tender!  Highly recommend if you ever go here get the strip steak!  Delmonico is good crusty on the outside but it was a little tough. Neighbors filet looked absolutely beautiful and they said it was delicious. Don't forget about the dessert room. It was the highlight of the night. They take you to a private room and you order coffees, liquor and of course dessert. I got the carrot cake with  some sort of ice cream that was to die for. Neighbors got macadamia hot fudge sundae. They wolfed it down haha. All in all a great evening. I don't think the prices were high at all for what you're getting not sure why everyone is saying it's expensive."

We had a reservation and we were seated in a corner near the entrance. We ordered the chorizo hash. It was the most disappointing meal I have had in a long time. The hash was cooked to perfection and the cheese was fresh. I don't know if I will return for brunch or brunch on a Sunday. I will say that I was disappointed with the service. I understand that the restaurant is a small place, but the service was not good. The waitress was slow and uninterested in our needs. She kept forgetting things we asked for. We ended up getting our drinks at the bar and no one came to see us. I don't know if the food was bad or if it was a bad meal. I will not be back. I will say that the service was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good breakfast. I've been here several times now and I've enjoyed everything on the menu. I have tried the chicken, ribs, pulled pork, and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is amazing and I've also tried the pulled pork. The pulled pork is phenomenal. The pulled pork is flavorful and hot and good."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"What a wonderful little place!  We snagged an 5:30pm table for two with no reservation (on a Friday night) right before the placed filled up. One of the owners was playing hostess for the evening while a waitress was out sick and, even though she was extremely busy, she was an attentive server and took the time to check on us throughout the evening without seeming harried. The place is small, and I have bad hearing, but it didn't seem too loud even though it was a full house. We had a nice table tucked away, but the others seems nicely spaced apart for more intimate dining conversation. We received a basket of freshly toasted bread with amazing, fresh garlic butter and a chickpea/button mushroom salad. Yum! We got a second basket of bread to finish up all the flavors. I had the State Street Mushroom soup, which was incredibly flavorful and SO SO SO delicious. When I raved about it to the owner, she took the time to explain how it was made. Can't wait to give it a try in my own kitchen!

I also had the Stuffed Portabello (yummy blue crab with horseradish creme fraiche) from the small plates menu. Between this big portabello, the soup, and the bread, (not to mention a few glasses of red -- gotta love BYOB!), I was stuffed for hours. My boyfriend got the Crispy Calamari, which was tender (and included the calamari caps, not just the rings) and the Hunter's Style Chicken with was served with yummy tomatoes and gnocchi-style potato dumplings. It was a large dish and he had to take some of his entree home. We were too full for dessert, but I bet it would have been amazing!  

I would love to return here for a special dinner."

The only downside is the location, but the service and food were great!I'm a huge fan of the sushi, and this place is probably the best in Tucson. I've only had the salmon and the fish, but I've had the sushi and the service. 

The sushi is delicious! I've only tried the sushi with the salmon, but I think the fish is a little bland. I really like that they have a separate sushi menu for the fish. 

I love that the decor is modern and very modern. The staff is always friendly and happy to help you with your order. 

The food is very fresh and I've never had anything I didn't like. I don't usually get sushi, but I've been here and it's always delicious. I've tried the fish tacos and the tuna fajitas and the salsas, both of which are also delicious. The salsas are also great.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Lotawata has been a favorite for years. My kids always want to go there, however, we don't live close so we haven't been in a couple years. We had a sport event in Edwardsville so we thought we'd stop for dinner on the way home. We were seated quickly. It was @10 minutes until our waitress came to take our drink order. We just ordered our food since we had plenty of time to look at the menu and my son was starving!  She said bread was in the oven and she'd be back with some. Well, her other tables (seated WAY after us) got bread and when we flagged her down she literally said ""oh, I forgot about you""!  Really?!?!  Even if you did, you don't say that!  It had been about 30 min since we ordered and my salad came (what I ordered for dinner). My husband and son ordered burgers. She never said they'd be right up, she didn't say anything!  After 10 minutes, I decided to eat!  I was finished eating and had my leftovers in a to-go box and she finally comes over and said they're food was coming it was behind a big order. Now, every table around us that were seated at least 30 minutes after us had already received they're food and were either gone or leaving. We asked to speak to a manager. After 10 minutes finally one came and we explained. He didn't apologize just said he'd check. About 5 minutes later he came with they're food. We were seated almost 2 hours!!!!  No explanation from the manager, just here's your food. He did take 1/2 off after we complained. I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"First and foremost this was a great experience. We ordered two pizzas, a cheesesteak and a burger. The cheesesteak was fantastic! The cheesesteak was large enough to take a little bit of the bite out of it. The burger was excellent. The sauce was flavorful and the bun was crispy and tasty. The burger was good, but the burger was extremely dry and had a very distinct flavor. The burger was very filling and flavorful. The fries were very good. I would highly recommend the burgers. I will definitely be back again!We had a great time here and we will definitely be back!  We ordered the lobster roll, chicken spring rolls, and salmon sushi rolls. The lobster roll was excellent, the chicken spring rolls were even better. The salmon sushi roll was pretty good as well. My only complaint would be that it's a little hard to get a table in the restaurant. There was a lot of people in the restaurant and there were a lot of people in the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sushi, seafood, and seafood!This was my first time at this place and I was very impressed.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The only thing I enjoyed about Jack's FIrehouse was the location.  It's located in - gasp! - an old firehouse.  The view is cool, too, because you're across the street from Eastern State Penitentiary.  Everything else about Jack's was just a mess.

Service was super slow.  There wasn't really anyone in the restaurant so there wasn't really an explanation for the slow service.  Everything on the menu was quite pricey especially considering how terrible our food was (we obviously didn't know that until we ordered).  

We started with soup - I had the black eyed pea and ham and my mom had some kind of vegetable soup.  My soup was just off... I'm not sure if there wasn't enough seasoning or there was too much ham, but it definitely didn't taste that good.  My mom's soup had way, way too much tomato in it.  It sort of tasted like pasta sauce, which is not good.

I ordered the Pulled Pork and Corn Chips for my entree and it was disgusting.  Literally.  I ate two bites and couldn't have any more.  The chips were insanely greasy.  I couldn't even really stomach them because the grease was too harsh.  The pulled pork was like a pile of wet vinegar in the middle of the pile of chips.  It was so gross that I couldn't eat it.  I just let it sit on the table until the waiter took it away.  My mom had crab cakes that she thought were OK - again, too much grease.  She was really turned off by how oily they were.

Blech.  For a whole lot of food that tasted awful, we were stuck with a $40 bill for two people at lunch.  I wouldn't come here again."

They have a great menu with lots of different items to choose from. I always get the fries. They are crisp and juicy. The burgers are great too. I'm not a huge burger person, but this one is really good. I usually get the burgers with the spicy mayo. I love their fries. They have a nice variety of toppings for your burger. My favorite is their spicy mayo. I also love their ranch dressing. I have never had ranch dressing but I love their ranch dressing. They also have a pretty good beer selection. They are pretty big and have a pretty good beer selection. They also have a lot of outdoor seating. They have outdoor seating so you can take your dog with you. It's always a great place to go!Food was good.  Service was horrible.  Not the best I have ever had.  Waitress took forever to get water and food.  Waitress seemed annoyed and uncomfortable.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I have been going to Taqueria Corona for about 30 years. I absolutely love the food. The beans and rice are incredible with a little of their green salsa (or a lot, if you like it that way, which I do). The black beans are refried and have that wonderful black bean savory, almost smokey flavor. It pairs nicely with the yellow rice. Their rice is neither sticky, nor dry. So often, places can't get it right. The green salsa has enough heat from the jalapenos to make it interesting, as well as a bit of tartness that makes it work perfectly in concert with the beans and rice. I think the next favorite thing I've had there is the shrimp flauta. It has enough seasoning to remind you that your eating at a Mexican restaurant, but the spice doesn't overwhelm the shrimp. The shrimp taste fresh, and I have never had one of their flautas with rubbery shrimp. Along with the shrimp, there is just the right amount of cheese inside the rolled, flour tortilla. So good! Don't forget that they come with some pretty tasty guacamole, as well.  The atmosphere is typical Latinx cantina, so it creates the ambiance most of us have come to expect from this type of place. The service is generally pretty good, though they are often VERY busy, which means they don't come back to check on you as often as you might like. They make up for that by being extremely polite and solicitous when you do see them, and if you catch their eye, they get to you pretty quickly.  All-in-all, it is one of my favorite restaurants in the New Orleans area, and if you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and go there! There's a reason it has been there for over 30 years!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This was one of the better ones I've had in Nashville. The food was good. The drinks were good, but the food was not great. I had the seafood gumbo and it was good, but nothing special. I had the shrimp and grits and it was good but nothing to write home about. My friend had the crab cake and she liked it but she didn't like the cornbread. I had the New England clam chowder and it was good but nothing to write home about. Service was good. We went there around 6:30 pm and they weren't busy at all. We had a good time and would definitely come back here. I went here for the first time last night with a group of coworkers and we were very impressed with the food. My wife had the chicken salad and I had the chicken salad and we all enjoyed it. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and it was delicious and the staff was very friendly. The prices were very reasonable for the portion sizes. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is a really different place.  We were happy with absolutely everything except the quality of the food.  

The restaurant is clean and well-maintained and the staff is friendly (from the host and hostesses to the bartenders to the waitresses and everyone in between).  This place is definitely a cut above the rest and attracts a more sophisticated? type of person that alot of the restaurants in the surrounding area.

You can't beat the location - right on the water.  I will be making the hour drive this summer to enjoy the outdoor patio and bar.  It's a great date spot with views of the water.  There was a friendly guy in his thirties on the piano playing and singing just about everything, from Sinatra to Sweet Caroline to contemporary hits. 

They have a lounge area just inside with a bar and some casual seating, and two separate dining rooms (what I could see, anyway), as well as that outdoor patio that was not open for the season quite yet.  

The food.  Bread with olive oil? Great. Ceasar salad? Just OK.  Seared Ahi Tuna? Pretty good! Entrees - had the penne with chicken and bruschetta in a garlic olive oil sauce.  I'm not sure what they did to the chicken, but whatever they do, they should change it.  I think it was boiled.  Grill that chicken and season it!  Overkill on the sauce as well.  Others with us had the scallops and enjoyed them.  I think someone else said this - the menu seems above the abilities of the cooks.

The food wasn't BAD, it just wasn't GREAT.  Like I said above, I'll be back this summer to enjoy the patio outside with some drinks and friends!  

You should give this place a shot."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"LOVE that the old Maylie's location has the same food and service as the one in the French Quarter.I had the burrito and a burrito with chorizo.

I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The place was pretty packed, but we were seated right away. 

We ordered the eggs benedict and the hash browns. The hash browns were very good, though I didn't like them much. I had the hash browns, which were crispy and tasty. The eggs benedict was on the more salty side, but was still very good. I had the eggs benedict, which I liked.

The hash browns were on the sweeter side, but still tasty. They were cooked well and had a good amount of cheese. The hash browns were good, though I didn't like them.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I hadn't planned on getting carryout but since I had to make a stop at Safeway, opted to get some lunch to go.  The restaurant is small, and old looking inside.  A fresh coat of paint and some wax on the floor could do wonders.  Also a machine in the entrance where you put your thumb to discover your ""sex power"" kind of turned me off.  But I was already there, so went ahead and ordered. 

They have lunch specials for about $7.00, they include soup, eggroll, entree, and steamed or fried rice.  I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken, and she offered to give an extra eggroll instead of the soup.  I prefer fried rice and there was no extra charge (some places do charge extra for fried rice).  Anyway, my wait was about 10 minutes which I didn't think was too bad.  

Usually Sweet and Sour chicken comes with green peppers, onions and some pineapple chunks.  There was no green peppers, onion or pineapple.  Not sure if they just forgot or if this is how it normally comes.  Anyway, there were about 8-10 medium size pieces of chicken.  The flavor was a little different than what I usually experience but in a good way.  I really enjoyed the sweet and sour sauce which did not overwhelm the chicken.  The fried rice was equally as flavorful.  

She did give me 2 eggrolls which were really springrolls (I like these better anyway) and they were good too.  I wish they had been crunchier, not sure if they got soft because they were sitting in the rice or if they always come that way.  Overall, I was happy with the entire meal and I will plan on going back there for lunch really soon!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My wife and I tried this place and we were very pleased. We had a reservation and the place was very packed. The food was delicious and the service was great.

We will definitely be coming back to try more of their menu!Love this place!  The food is amazing, the service is great.  I love that they have a parking lot in front of the building and the people are always friendly.  The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the price point.  I ordered the 3 meat pizzas and they were not good at all.  I also ordered the chicken parmigiana with tomato sauce.  The chicken parmigiana was not the best I have ever had, but it was good.  I ordered the Greek salad and it was good.  The chicken parmigiana was not so good.  The chicken parmigiana was not cooked to perfection and was very dry and flavorless.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Should Have Been Better

The Library is a little oddly housed in a portion of All Children's Hospital.  There is some nice outdoor seating, although not usable in the June heat.  Inside is very modern and nicely decorated and quite comfortable.

The food, however, didn't live up to our expectations.  Our overall impression was that the food generally was a bit dull and the flavors muddy and needed some brightness.  A little balsamic here or lemon juice there would have helped a great deal.

The bar area is quite attractive and I hoped for a good collection of craft cocktails.  The short list of specialty cocktails, however, only contained minor riffs on standard drinks.  We had the Fitzgerald and the Daisy Miller which were both pleasant enough.

For appetizers we had the fried brussel sprouts.  It was a huge serving.  They tasted mostly of the over-flash-fried exterior and needed serious seasoning.  Some balsamic reduction that we asked for definitely brightened it up.  We had over half of it boxed up to go home where we'll add some seasoning.  The grilled oyster appetizer was the best item of our dinner.  The oysters were large and juicy and were nicely grilled and seasoned.

We moved on to a Mediterranean salad.  It was fine but way overpriced at $18.

For entrees we had the ""lime crusted halibut"" which was not lime crusted.  It was just a fairly plain piece of halibut.  It was properly cooked but needed some seasoning and brightness.  The roasted chicken was quite nice.

We didn't bother with dessert since nothing on the dessert list looked interesting.

On Tuesdays they have bottles of wine for half price, so that was nice.  Service was pleasant.

Unfortunately, there just weren't enough highlights in our $200 (after tax & tip) meal to warrant a return trip."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"One of New Orleans staples is BBQ Shrimp. Upon researching, you'll find that Mr. B's is one of the top restaurants that serve the item. I'm just going to be blunt. The dining experience is pretty etiquette, or they try to be. I appreciate the silverware settings and constantly getting new plates, but I'd rather receive amazing food than amazing service. 

We ordered; Fried Catfish, Fried Oysters, Chicken Gumbo, and some specialty fried chicken-mac cheese-collard greens dish

Fried Catfish and Fried Alligator: For the price, these two dishes were pretty good. Except for the notion whilst I had the last piece of fried oyster, the bus boy took my plate with the sauce. 

Fried chicken with mac cheese and collard greens: For $22, I was expecting this plate to blow my mind. Needless to say, chicken was overly salty and the sides were bland. Pass.

BBQ Shrimp: For $28, the highest I've payed for this dish, I was expecting something amazing, but turned out to be pretty ordinary. Compared to Superior Seafoods BBQ Shrimp for $22, there's hardly a difference. Save yourself the trip.

Chicken Gumbo: I had originally ordered the Seafood gumbo, but was told it was not in season, so I opted for the chicken instead; What's the harm. Holy shit. One bite, that's all. I threw my napkin in and called it quits. I never say this to any dish, but worst gumbo in new orleans ever. I didn't even bring it up to the server. Just took it to the bill and crowned it worst ever.

It would have been nice if the server could have taken notice to the practically untouched gumbo, but I guess he wasn't haven't it either.

Mr. B's is just a fluke. If you want to get the ""fine, wine, and dine"" experience with overly priced foods, look no more. Sorry Mr. B, you're just not for me."

From the time we got to the time we left we had a great time.  The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. The only complaint is that the bread was extremely thick.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've experienced better- From them, I'm sure. 
The service was appalling. We were there pretty late, and I felt pretty bad for being there late, but we asked if it was okay (it was about half hour-40 minutes until close), and they said that was fine and we can take our time. 

My brother, boyfriend, anf sister in law and I arrived before my father and his girlfriend. We met them for dinner- he was in town from Clarksdale, MS, and he wanted to come here- That's completely fine. I hadn't been to Shaprios since I was younger, and we used to come here a lot. 

Yes- The sandwiches are $12- Some even more. The potato salad was pretty good, and the Mac N Cheese- deelish. I think we all ordered it. I think it might have been a bit too much. I did end up taking half of my sandwich home along with a pickle spear (I got two) and half of my potato salad. 

The manager was pretty nice for the most part, but the other people working seemed angry that we were there (we weren't even the only ones). The woman who rang us up actually made us feel bad. My dad (behind us) said he had it. We didn't know if she needed to see what we had. ""What you drinking?"" She yelled to everyone- No expression on her face. Never told us to go ahead, gave us direction, nothing. Had us standing there while she got drinks for the people behind us then barked at us that we were ""free to go.""
I felt like I just got yelled at- like I had done something to get in trouble. 

The food was good (just ate my left overs for lunch today)- The service, though- Does not leave me wanting to come back again- Not to be treated like that."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"First meal in New Orleans, right after flying in from California. We were told wait would be 15-25 minutes for 3, at around 7:45 on a Tuesday night. Not bad, but we decided to sit at the bar cause we were starving. 

Bartender was a little distant at first, but seemed to be the same with the others at the bar as well so we didn't take it personally. Ended up warming up to us really nicely though. Chatted with some servers as they came to the bar to deliver food and they were all incredibly friendly. Complementary loaf of the lightest, fluffiest French bread. 

I got the Seared Jumbo Scallops appetizer: $15. Came with a small salad. The scallops were delicious! Flavorful, tender, and cooked to perfection. Practically melted in the mouth. The order came with only 2, but they were huge as promised, and it was only an appetizer after all. 

I decided I needed a little something more, and went with the Soup 1-1-1: $8.50; a combo of their three soups-Gumbo Ya Ya (good, nothing extraordinary, had a little kick; the sausage didn't have too much flavor), Seafood Gumbo (similar to the Gumbo Ya Ya; same kick, both had wild rice in it) and the Soup Du Jour (not exactly sure what it was; yellow-golden color, rich, creamy flavor with shrimp). The Du Jour was the best of the 3, but the trio option was still nice. This came with a loaf of French bread as well. 

Bistro Salad: $9. The vinaigrette was delightful, but the veggies weren't anything special. 

Soft Shell Crab: $34. Delicious!! Looks deceptively brown and shriveled, but almost squirted juices as it was cut. Crab meat was soft; could've been less lightly breaded. The corn bed was perfect; creamy and flavorful, and went nicely with the loaf of French bread. 

Two beers+tip brought the tab to $100."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Maybe it's because I'm a bit Italian, maybe it's because I've been to a ton of family owned Italian restaurants or maybe it's because I know how to cook, but for whatever reason, after my second visit to Ralph's, I feel I can do better.

First the good points, the place seems to get a good crowd  The decor and staff are what you'd expect at an Italian American restaurant.  And that's really about it.  

I ordered the veal ""marsala.""  I was intrigued by the use of sherry instead of the traditional Marsala wine, from which the dish gets its name.  Absent was the prosciutto and light brown sauce you'd expect. In their place was a strangely fatty creamy broth into which were placed a few veal slices along with the expected mushrooms.  If you're going to call a dish something, then for the love of God and all that's holy, use the correct ingredients.  Sherry comes from Spain and Marsala comes from Sicily.  They don't even taste the same.  

The broccoli and escarole as a side dish was much better.  However, it doesn't take much effort to properly steam something and then season it.

Now about the server, when I asked which RED wines they had by the glass, the server listed Pinot Grigio and one or other whites,..huh?  Also, five minutes after you've served the food don't come back and ask if we need anything. Obviously not, you just served the food.

Also it's 2009, learn how to run a credit card machine.  That's perhaps acceptable at a BYOB but not at places that charge PA restaurant prices for a bottle of wine.  Most people don't carry around more than $50 in cash with them and it's just tacky to have an ATM on the premises that you're making money off with fees."

Even though their special of the day sounded amazing I opted for the shoyu which is a chicken broth but changed the grilled pork belly for the shrimp. It was very delicious. It was a Large portion, but wish I had more than 2 shrimp. I would be more happy with 3. I was a bit disappointed after I ate the second one I was like ok. But it was very delicious and filling. I also got their mimosa and it was light and refreshing. Tasted like a juice, easy to go down but was pleasantly surprised when I walked out feeling very rather happy. I also taste the luck plus which seems like their version of a mojito it was quite delicious as well. Over all satisfied with everything, the space was super chill and earthy which was fun and different. Only thing I didn't per say like was that we asked for a bit of hot sauce and one of the servers told us about what they had so we figured yeah we'll try both, they were rather intricate sauces, well soon enough we were brought two small bowls one with a red paste and the other with a darker green paste. They were nice but I didn't really use it. When the bill came we realized we were charged for the condiments, which is alright, It would have been nice to be informed and since the sauces are so rare maybe even offer a taste before you give us a larger portion? Because we didn't really use it other than for tasting. But will definitely go back to their other dishes on the menu!!!"

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Outstanding food, service and atmosphere make this a new favorite for me.

Stopped by on a Sunday and walked in to a large, high ceilinged room, that just feels spacious and a tasteful, not overly themed, decor that was pleasing to the eye.

Service was spectacular. Chips and salsa were immediately delivered to our table. When we asked if there was a spicier or hotter version of the salsa, a second bowl also quickly arrived.

Note that the spicy version was exactly that. It brought the heat and we were thrilled. But I don't know that the degree of heat is to everyone's taste so try it but don't over do it.

We were not rushed but thoughtfully approached and asked if we were ready to order but also invited to take all of the time we needed. Nice!

The extensive menu offers so many great options it may be difficult to decide but I am convinced you can't go wrong with whatever you order and prices are extremely reasonable. 

The plates arrived hot, everything on the plate looked fresh and perfectly cooked and the first to last bite were a real delight. The melted cheese was outstanding but so was the guacamole, the sauce and, well, everything. 

Too many times something falls short when dining out. It is easy to make excuses like it was a busy time or maybe the kitchen was having an off night.

A restaurant is judged by that first visit. Failure to deliver and no need to return. Check all of the boxes and I am not only thankful but likely to be vocal and loyal.

When I find a place that shows it knows what to do and how to do it, I have less patience with those that skate by, offer irregular product or service or just do as little as possible to give the guest a great experience.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We ordered the ""meat"" and cheese board for an appetizer and were rather disappointed with what we got, so much so that I had to leave a review.

We get that Gypsy Blu isn't a Michelin star restaurant, but for $22 we expected a decent charcuterie board. What came out looked like an adult lunchable. 

First, it had almost no cured meat which is why I put ""meat"" in quotations. About 3 slices of salami and 3 slices of what appeared to be prosciutto. 

Second, the cheese was cut up deli slices. I've never been served this before, even at another restaurant serving meat and cheese plates for half the price. Really couldn't believe they actually served cut up pre-sliced cheese that I can go buy at Aldi. 

Third, the board was mostly fruit. Half a cut up red and green apple, a few strawberries, and prunes/raisins (could not tell what they were). Also some half grilled bread and a few canned pecans.

Lastly, nothing actually went together in terms of flavor. I'm really not sure who designed this dish, but it was rather depressing. It felt like it was thrown together last minute without much thought or testing. 
My suggestion would be to please redesign this menu item and consult a chef trained in charcuterie to make it a better experience.

Our other items were okay. The salmon was cooked well and steak was on point, but sides were not. Rice was  overcooked and 1/2 the asparagus was undercooked, which seem like fundamental cooking mistakes for simple items.

Gave them 2 stars because the service was friendly and drinks were good, but would not eat here again. Maybe the typical pub food (fries, burgers, etc) is better, but they don't seem to have a good grasp of their dinner menu. Could be a 4 or 5 star experience if they put some more time into planning and cooking their food."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The difference Between 1 & 2 stars is the food. I will say that the best thing about this place is the service. The food is good but the service is terrible. I go here with a group of friends and they all get the same thing. This is the worst service I have had in a while. I will never go back.I ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived 15 minutes after I placed it.  I asked the driver what it was and he said it was ""cold.""  I told him I had a delivery order and he said, ""well, that's what it's called.""  When I asked for it, he said, ""it's cold.""  I told him that I was ""just visiting"" and he told me I had a delivery order.  

I called the restaurant and was told that my order would be ready 20 minutes later.  I called again the next day and was told that the driver had just called me and they would be out of pizza.  I called again the next day and was told that I was ""just visiting"" and that they were out of the pizza.  I called again the next day and was told that the driver was out of the pizza and he would be out of it.  I called again the next day and was told that I would be out of pizza.  I called again the next day and was told that I had a delivery order and he had just called me and he said, ""that's what it was called.""  I told him that I had a delivery"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The Pump House is a damn good sports bar. Great selection of beer, crispy chicken wings and an extensive menu to satisfy any craving.

The bar is spacious and to my understanding from speaking to others at the celebration I was attending, the PH has added on numerous times during their growth. Which means they are popular with the locals and after my experience I can see why. 

I was here for the celebration of a friend paying off their college loan. Yippie, she did it in six years. For those of you who still have those loans, know that is a major accomplishment worthy of a celebration. Due to the lay-out of the bar, we were spread out in to two areas, but with some mingling it worked out just fine. 

I enjoyed a couple of craft beers and an order of chicken wings at the beginning of the party.  Wings were impressive for a sports bar. Their wings are never frozen and prepared to order in their own breading. They offer a large variety of styles, I chose the servers favorite, Garlic Parmesan. She gave me good advice. 

 As the evening winded down, several of us decided to stay for dinner. We all were glancing over the menu, then our server told us that the Thursday night special was a Ribeye for $14.95. At that price how can you go wrong. It came with a side of Green Beans and a potato. I wanted, their infamous Potato Balls, but they had been 86 for the night. 86 = Sold Out. Damn, it. I ended up choosing their regular french fries. 

Service was attentive for the huge sports bar crowd. It was nice to see outlets and purse/coat hooks under the bar. Nice customer service for a sports bar. 

Will I return? - Sure, if I'm on that side of the river.

Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I often come here or go to the Reading Terminal Market for a cup of coffee. I'm not a coffee snob, but I think they're the best in the city. I'm so excited to have found a good Thai restaurant in the area. This is my first time here and I was looking forward to trying the curry and the curry chicken. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the chicken curry and it was extremely greasy and tasted like it came from a can. The chicken was very dry and had no flavor. The curry tasted like it had been sitting out for a while and was extremely salty. I definitely would not recommend it to anyone. This is my favorite breakfast place in town. The food is always good and the service is always excellent. My husband and I have been coming here for years and the food is always good. I have never had a bad meal here. I recommend their breakfast burrito or their breakfast sandwich. I have never had a bad meal here. I love this place! I went for lunch today and it was amazing! The staff was friendly and the food was so delicious. The owner, Steve, was very nice and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our meal! He made sure we had everything we ordered. I will be back. This is a must try if you are in town!Best chicken and waffles! The food is delicious and delicious! 

This is a little pricey, but I would definitely recommend going here. Great atmosphere, but I would recommend a couple of hours before or after dinner."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"PERUVIAN FOOD IS A VERY GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN WHATEVER IT IS THIS RESTAURANT IS SERVING!!!
Most Americans have no idea what Peruvian food should taste like. That is the only reason I can think of for the high rating of this TERRIBLE excuse for a Peruvian restaurant.
There are some basic dishes that are the true test of Peruvian cooking. People who can't make these, can't make anything. Probably the most well-known of these is ""Papa a la Huancaina"", which this restaurant absolutely RUINS!!! It LOOKS like papa a la huancaina, sort of, but not really. It TASTES absolutely horrid and is not remotely similar to the real dish. 'Potato in a yellow water sauce' is the best I can call this pathetic attempt.
Worse still, this restaurant uses cheap substitutes for ingredients that are difficult, but not impossible to acquire. They just don't want to be bothered. The Peruvian olive is very distinctive, reminiscent of Greek Kalamata olives, but larger. They are absolutely delicious. You won't get any here. Inca's puts ordinary canned black olives in their food, instead. Simply disgusting, this robs dishes that use Peruvian olives (there are many) of a primary, indispensable flavor. Peruvian food DOES NOT use these olives for decoration. They are there specifically to add flavor. The only comparison that occurs to me is putting ketchup on French cuisine... but, WORSE!
To add insult to injury, the prices are simply ridiculous. These are not expensive dishes to make.
I read somewhere that there are two Peruvian restaurants in Tucson, one good, one bad. I certainly hope THIS is the bad one. If not, the other one must have a body count. But you risk little. Go to the other Peruvian restaurant in Tucson. After Inca's , I can only ask, how bad could the other restaurant possibly be?!!!
Until yesterday, I had a very high opinion of Guy Fieri. He should sue these people for tarnishing his reputation."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I have been lucky enough to have the pleasure of meeting two of my favorite chefs in St. Louis. The food is always delicious. The staff is always friendly and the ambience is inviting. It's a great place for a date night or to grab some good food. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this place. This place is awesome!!  Food is great, friendly service, and very delicious!   I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was very good!   I had a chicken cheesesteak with fries, and it was perfect. I also had a side of fries and they were amazing. I'll definitely be back for dinner!!This place is a must! I have been here several times now and the food is always consistent. The service is always on point. The atmosphere is really nice and very welcoming. I recommend the panini, as well as the grilled cheese. The decor is beautiful and very modern. The staff is always friendly and happy to help you with your order. They will make you feel at home as soon as you walk in. The food is always good and fresh. I have also tried the fried green tomatoes and the bacon. I love the chicken and the blue cheese bread is perfect. The green tomato sauce is the best! I love the spinach and onions. The red sauce is great and the blue cheese is the best. The location is a little pricey, but I have never been disappointed."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Being in from out of town, we had no idea what to check out for lunch. We randomly found Sunbake Pita, and we are so glad we did. 

We walked in and the place was very busy both buying food and pitas. It looks like they really sell quite a few pitas as people were buying them constantly while we were there. The menu was presented above the service line with nice pictures showing what you were getting. We decided to go with a chicken schwarma wrap, meat and cheese pita, and a chicken and spinach pita. When ordering, we asked if the offered any sides with the pita and we're told they do not. 

We went and grabbed a seat by the window. They do not have many seats to eat inside, but do have a few. We checked out the mixed nuts while waiting on our food as well. 

The food arrived quickly and looked great. All of the pitas were very tasty. While we were eating, I was tapped on the shoulder and handed a couple plates of tabouli salad. I think it may have been the owner, but he explained they supply the salad, but don't normally sell it. He gave us the plates and told us to enjoy. It was the best tabouli salad I have ever had. Not overly green with parsley and it had a nice tartness from the lemon juice. Our lunch was very fulfilling. 

After finishing our meal, we chatted about how reasonable the meals cost was. My coworker got both the meat and cheese pita, a coke, and a chicken and spinach pita for $9. My schwarma was about $9 as well. It may have been the cheapest meal we had in Edmonton.

After you are done eating there, don't forget to check out the Lebanese bakery a few doors down. All the pastries were enjoyed by the guys at the shop."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,We had a private event here last night with my fiancé and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious. The drinks are great and the food is delicious. The cocktails are great and the staff is very friendly. This is our new favorite local bar. Highly recommend.We have been going to this place for over a decade.  We have tried several different food items on the menu and each time we have enjoyed everything.  The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  I love that they have a parking lot in front of the restaurant and a few parking spots at the back.  They have a lot of options for people to sit and enjoy the food.  I can't wait to go back and try a few other items on the menu.  My favorite is the chicken tacos.  You can add green sauce on the side and the chicken is seasoned just right.  I like the spicy salsa that is on the side and the fresh avocado.  The chicken is always moist and flavorful.  The service is always great and the food is always fresh and tasty.  They also have a great drink menu with all the beers on draft.  There are a few tables outside and a bar.  The food is always delicious.  I always get the buffalo chicken burrito with chicken and green salsa.  The food is always delicious and the salsa is always delicious.  The chips are fresh and hot.   The only downfall is the bar is never full.  It is very loud.  The bar is really loud
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Being Indian, I know a thing or two about good Indian food and highly recommend this place! I usually dine here once a month with friends and we typically order two appetizers and four to five dishes to split amongst us. Comments in regards to a few of the dishes...

+Butter chicken is so delicious. It is hands down my favorite Indian dish and I will ALWAYS order it from here! I made the mistake of asking for it very very very spicy and it ended up being a little too hot. I think very spicy is enough for those of you who like a little fire in your mouth. (And yes, the number of ""very""s is a useful spiceness scale!)

+Saag paneer. Also very good and rich. 

+Tandoor chicken and the Bombay Bhel are excellent appetizers. 

+Bullet naan. Holy hell! Yall, I love me some spicy food but cannot handle the bullet naan with its jalepenos bits kneaded into the dough! Their regular and garlic naans are quite tasty. 

Pricing is on par with your typical Indian restaurants which means slightly too expensive to make this a weekly outing but this is not a place that you necessarily need to save for a special occasion. Service, décor, and ambience is wonderful! I prefer their dinner a la carte menu over their buffet which is quite small in selection (butter chicken was not part of the buffet!)

The only reason I deduct a star is that they are quite frequently out of one dish or another on their menu. One time in particular, my parents were visiting from out of town and my Dad wanted to try some of their South Indian dishes and the server informed us that they weren't doing any South Indian food that night---if I'm not mistaken, they have an entire page dedicated to South Indian food so that was pretty disappointing! Thankfully, my beloved butter chicken has always been available!"

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The Honor Bar is perfection. I'd highly recommend this spot for brunch or an early lunch if your in the area. Relaxing outdoor patio for people watching, delicious cocktails, and a fun ""upscale"" lunch menu.

Came here for lunch on Saturday and I'd highly recommend coming when they open for an early lunch. Everyone seems to be a fan of the outdoor seating, pretty small as they have about 7 tables along the downtown sidewalk. Easily a 30 minute wait minimum if you come any later then 15 minutes after opening like we did. For those wanting to dine for lunch the wait for outdoor seating was easily an hour. However, totally worth it.

The menu isn't huge but everything looked and sounded delicious it was hard to pick. For lunch they have a handful of appetizers and the majority of the menu is salads and sandwiches. The burger on the menu also sounded amazing and we noticed a lot of tables were going with burgers and sandwiches.

I went with the French dip and wasn't disappointed! The bread is fresh & the prime rib was flavorful and medium/medium rare like we asked for. You also have to add the horseradish sauce, totally makes the dish! A side of French fries hit the spot, got to love when they naturally bring spicy Mayo as a dipping side.

Another reason to come is for the cocktails. I tried ""the crush"" which was a super refreshing cocktail of vodka, muddled grapes, and basil. Added some simple syrup at my request for some sweetness and it was the perfect afternoon drink.

Service was also 5 stars worthy. Polite and friendly, we were checked on frequently but also left alone to chit chat without interruptions. Our meals came out relatively quickly despite the rush and I will say I was impressed with everything from the atmosphere, to the food, and to the drinks. This spot is on my list from now on!"

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"So sadly, I've been back 2 more times and have to say now that although it's a great place to drink, I'd have to be really hungry to eat there again.  

I ordered the scallops special for $14 that was an entree and I was told that they are two huge scallops with asparagus and something else.  Um, they were you average two scallops.  There were maybe 4 half-sized stalks of asparagus.  I'd rather pay $20 and get 4 scallops!  And if they chinze on the scallops, you'd think you'd get a bunch of side stuff but no.  And they were out of the two vegetarian appetizers so I had no options since I was still hungry.  

The next time I went I ordered the falafel sandwich and the cabbage and apple slaw.  The falafel came on thick, good pita but the tahini was rather tasteless and the falafel was mushy.  The pickled veggies on the side left a lot to be desired--I'm not sure pickled anything is a good side dish.

The cabbage and apple slaw was also tasteless.  I think I had one forkful and I sent the rest back.  

I tried some fries and they are called herbed something or other.  As my friend remarked, they're all stubby fries.  It looks like they went through the short side of the potato peeler so you can't really get a good grip on any of them.  And some were undercooked.  Some were fine.  My other friend ordered a basket of them which was a steep $6...and she remarked it would be nice to pay $4 for half of them...since she got a 1/4 of the way through and they were all cold and clearly just too many fries even for a table of 4.  

So I better stick with the veggie board since I don't eat meat."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My BF really wanted to go watch the soccer game or was it a championship? Or EuroCup? Whatever, some sort of soccer championship with some hot Portuguese player. And Fleet Street is well known to have all the soccer games on. So we got up early despite a pretty long night the night before and headed to Fleet Street. You go down the stairs to get in the place and that gives it this cool, underground vibe. There are tables when you walk in, a long bar on the right once you pass the tables (with tables along the wall across from the bar) and then more tables beyond the bar. Tons of TVs. So we got there early enough to get a 4 top across from the bar. right before it got completely packed and standing room only. They definitely have the British food choices down. Anything you can think of, it is on this menu. Fish and chips with mushy peas, Shepherd's pie, curry, anything. They also have a drink menu complete with a Pimm's Cup which I most definitely had. Refreshing! I ordered fish and chips and they are done very well. It helped soak up all the beer I drank after the initial Pimm's Cup also. We had some new friends join us also - tourists we met the night before from Minnesota - which made it even more festive. Who does a Sunday drink fest better than tourists who have nothing to do the next day?

This place is smoking inside after 2pm but for this event no one was really doing it so for big events the smoke may not bother you. However, I've been here on random weekend nights and it was legitimately smoky so if you don't like that, then drive on. I always forget about this place and honestly I like its vibe and should go more often. Thanks for reminding me of that, Fleet Street."

I will definitely be back and I hope they bring some more staff.We came here for a quick lunch and were not disappointed.  I had the New England clam chowder and my husband had the salmon salad.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Been to this place twice, fantastic happy hour (3pm-6pm) and i think they tie it into their lunch specials as well.  The first time it was slammed and you had to have a reservation to eat, which i didn't have, but they were able to seat us due to a table opening up last minute.  So glad they had space because this place turned out being a gem in Santa Barbara.  The location is close to downtown and you can either walk or drive to it.  The establishment itself is a historical house that has been converted into a restaurant.  They offer both seating inside and outside, if you come in a high traffic time sans reservation.... good luck sitting outside, especially on nice days.  As for the food, i have done with the Rancho Burrito and Carne Asada Burrito, the rice and beans that come with it are beyond good.  I usually don't eat the rice and beans (trying to keep this a 4.7) but i tried theres and they are awesome.  Moving onto the actual burrito, they are fantastic.  I don't know if the tortillas are made in house or made close by, but they are SUPER good and the steak they use is fantastic.  I was also able to steal a slice or two of a quesadilla and it was great.  

For their drinks, and drink specials, they are great and if you go during happy hour you can save yourself a bit of $ since the prices are slightly higher, due in part to that fact that you're eating fine dining for mexican AND in Santa Barbara.  All in all, if you want a nice place to sit down and have authentic mexican come here, if you want a place to take a date and want a good happy hour and meal, i would call and set up a reservation."

I love their food, the service, and the ambience. I had the Chicken Caesar Salad with it's bread. I have to say it was the best salad I have had in a long time. The dressing was a bit on the salty side, but the chicken was still delicious and I was able to eat it with a spoon. I would definitely go back. The ambiance is really nice too. I recommend this place to anyone who loves a good meal. The atmosphere is great, the service is great and the food is just ok. My last visit was the food was very good, but the service was not great. The service was not good either. I don't recommend this place to anyone. I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, but when I go to this place, I always order from their lunch menu. I like to order it with my food. Their food is pretty good, so that's why I'm getting the shrimp and beef and egg roll instead of the chicken. I think that's why I like their chicken."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My strongest urge is to lie to my YELP family so that I may insure myself a seat at this cantina and not have to wait behind an onslaught of diners this place deserves. Without profiling I will say that a large percentage of Mexican restaurants are old, unkempt, dirty, and grease is heavy in the air. This cantina is modern, bright, and most importantly clean. Roberto our server was very attentive, descriptive on menu items and preparation, and was always there when you needed him. The menu is very creative and covers a broader spectrum of tastes and combinations than the regular Mexican fare. We started with complimentary chips and fresh salsa and we added a quest dip filled with chorizo to go with our chips and it was an amazing add on. I am a fajita fan and I had the most flavorful and creative fajitas I've experienced in any Mexican establishment. I really enjoyed the seafood fajitas that had crab meat, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and fish and it was a very large serving all for $16? Wow! Some places locally charge that for just chicken fajitas. This is the best fajitas I have ever experienced. My beautiful wife absolutely loved her carnitas and shrimp tacos and they were served street style with fresh onions and cilantro. I read some other reviews where folks complained of bland food and I haven't a clue of what they are talking about because even the rice and beans had great flavor to them. We finished our meal with an oversized fried ice cream for dessert and it not the freezer burned and stale item that's been on the premise for Months in a drop freezer but freshly made. The pricing here is fabulous and more than fair value. Drink specials and happy hour everyday as well. We were very impressed and when it comes to Mexican dining this is our new and permanent place to go. Awesome experience."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I want to start off by saying I am a HUGE fan of Gino's! I have been here before and had a great experience. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. The only complaint I have is that it was a little pricey. But it was definitely worth it. I will definitely be back!I had the crab cake with a side of pastrami. It was amazing! I can't say enough about the atmosphere. The staff was very attentive and friendly. My only complaint is that I would've loved to have gotten a coffee with my meal but it was really cold. I really liked the bread pudding and the lemonade. I will definitely be back for dinner and to grab some coffee. This is my favorite restaurant in town! I have been coming here since I was a child.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I come here probably 4-5/month for probably nearly 10 years already and have never ever been disappointed. This place is absolutely delicious! From the Thai dishes to the Japanese dishes to the apps to the Thai tea to the desserts to the sushi (the Caterpillar, the Volcano, the TST, the Fireballs, the Ocean Queen, the Mexican Roll, the Tampa Roll are all FRESH and DIVINE!!!!) This has become our family fave. If you're thinking of trying sushi for the first time, just come here. Try the cooked sushi first such as the TST or Mexican Roll or Tampa Roll. Those are great starters bc they're cooked. The TST is like tempura fried and the shrimp is fried and covered with panko and the Tampa Roll is a white fish also covered with panko so it reminds me of a fish stick in a way but waaaaaaay better of course. The Thai food like the Phad Thai, Red Curry with chicken or mango curry are all delicious. The negi maki app is really really tasty!! I just love it here so much! It's close to where we live, very filling and tasty and the staff is always very kind and pleasant!! The saki is also a win! My husband loves that they provide the option to serve it in a large pot vs a large pitcher like most other Thai restaurants as the pot is larger. The options on the lunch menu are also really great! Oh and the baked green mussels are absolutely wonderful! Is there anything we don't care for on the menu? Not really! It's all delicious!! 

Update: stuck in quarantine and they have been closed during this time.  Can't wait to have our volcano roll, caterpillar roll, screaming salmon which is one my new faves (no rice, wrapped in seaweed and super creamy!!) and Phad Thai, Amazing Peanut and Red Curry!! And the service is always fantastic! This will always be our family favorite!!"

I asked again, and she told me that she would make another one. She said ""they don't have to make it right."" She said ""they don't have to make it right."" I asked again, and she told me that she would make it right. She never said ""they don't have to make it right."" The manager told me that she would make it right"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Continues to be my favorite place to get coffee in Westchase.

I haven't been disappointed by anything I've gotten here. The employees are friendly, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and there is always a moderate number of people so it doesn't feel packed, but it feels like the place to be. Here are my thoughts on my most recent orders.

Hot Matcha Latte - this is my go to. It isn't sweetened, but it doesn't need to be! It has a strong matcha flavor and I always get it with oat milk. It has enough caffeine that it picks me up!

Blind Tiger Bowl - this is my favorite acai bowl anywhere. It is sweet without being too sweet. The ground espresso gives it a more complex flavor than I find in other acai bowls. There is the right amount of chocolate chips to make it somewhat decadent. 

Pumpkin Cheesecake Macaron - the pastry display case changes every time I see it so act fast if you see the macarons! They are really good. Apparently they are made in house at one of the other locations. The pumpkin cheesecake one really did taste like cheesecake! They are on the larger side so I split one with a friend and it satisfied my sweet tooth.

Edible Dough - I finally got to try their edible dough. The small is $5 and you get so much! Two scoops is way more than enough. I tried the Chocolate Chip and the Peanut Butter Fluff. Unfortunately, they were out of the Sweet and Salty, which is what I originally wanted to try. I really liked the Chocolate Chip. I wasn't as big a fan of the Peanut Butter Fluff. It has a strange taste to it. Next time I'll try something else. It was really good and the fun part is the container says you can bake it to make an actual cookie!

This is still my go-to coffee shop. I've yet to have a bad experience."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This was the absolute worst experience of my life. We were in a hurry, the waitresses were so rude and the food was mediocre at best. The manager was so rude and made us feel unwelcome. It's not even a bad experience. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I ordered the chicken nuggets and they were completely over cooked and barely had any seasoning. They were just grilled chicken with no seasoning. The manager should have told me that when I got home that it was frozen, but I was so turned off by the fact that it was not even in a bag. The manager should have told me that they have been frozen. I don't know how they can even cook this chicken to a high temperature. It tasted like they didn't care how it was cooked. I wish they would have sent it back, but I wouldn't recommend this place. Very cute little cafe. I got a strawberry latte and a latte with a little sugar in it. The latte was good. The latte was a little too sweet for my taste. I was able to eat it without the syrup and the strawberry was tasty. The latte was served with a side of coffee. The coffee was good. The latte was a little too sweet and the latte was served on a plate. I could have gotten a latte with a lot of coffee. It was a little too rich. My friend got a latte and it was good. She enjoyed it. Overall it was pretty expensive but I liked the coffee and it was good. I'd recommend it. It was good."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went here for dinner this weekend. Atmosphere is nice and great for dates or family outings. Reservations are recommended as it gets quite busy! 

I did notice that there were many hostesses/waitresses clumped behind the front desk standing and talking to each other, however none seemed eager to seat us. Had to wait for a few minutes until their conversation was over to be seated.

After being seated, we ordered the tuna tartar appetizer which describes it topped with a quail egg. When it came out we noticed there was no egg and asked the waitress about it. She returned after talking to the chef saying they ran out but added a larger portion of tuna to compensate. We were a bit upset at not being told this before the food came out and asked if it was ok, especially since it was an $18 appetizer. Even with the ""extra portion"" of tuna (which by the way may or may not have happened as the portion is still incredibly tiny), I don't think anyone would be happy at having a key ingredient left out and still have it served without mention of it. Felt a bit gypped. I would have felt better if they mentioned some kind of discount or asked if we would still like it, but the waitress just smiled and walked away. We decided not to send it back: the tuna was cut with a lot of seasoning and was swimming in a soy sauce-based liquid, which made the tuna fall apart and incredibly hard to eat. For $18, and a tiny portion, I would not recommend ordering this.

We also ordered the James Bond roll (my boyfriends favorite), the ooka dragon roll (my favorite, loved the fresh eel) and also the Hana roll (had an odd beef topping and an over abundance of herbal seasoning; very salty. Would not recommend)

Overall, ooka impressed me with its ambience and fresh ingredients, but their service and price I think are disappointing."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Cracker Barrel is my favorite brewery in the area. I always love that they have local beers. If you want a beer, they have some great brews. I go to this brewery every weekend and get a beer every time. This brewery is a great place for a beer hang out. I go here on a weekly basis and I haven't had a bad meal here. The beer selection is pretty good. I like that they have a ton of local craft beers on tap. The staff is really nice and helpful. I usually go with a couple beers and they have a good selection of craft beers. I like to try something different here as well. I also like that they have a nice selection of local craft beers. I usually get a little of everything from their special beers and I also like that they have a small selection of their specialty beers. It's a great place to hang out for a beer and watch a game.

I have been here about once a week and it's been a good experience. I've only been here once a week and I think I've only had to wait a little longer than a week. The beer is pretty good and the service is good. I've had the wings, but I've had a couple of times that haven't been good. It's not great."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I want to love this place, but unfortunately Slyce Pizza Bar lacks consistency, and the service can be atrocious, if not disgustingly arrogant. While on vacation, I had a few experiences.

Delivery:  The young kid that does the delivery was very friendly, and genuinely thankful for his tip. The buffalo chicken pizza was horrible. Actually, one of the worst I've had.

Dine in: I didn't want to go back, but my dad raves about this place, so we dined in later in the week. When entering, there's a black guy who mans the host / hostess stand. His attitude is one of a jailer, who runs a gestapo. Seriously, you're a f'n host; stop treating customers as if they're the enemy. The young girl (short, with dark hair) who works beside him was awesome, and was apologizing to other customers as well for *his* attitude.

Our server, who was a younger blonde girl (awesome smile) was as good as they come. The quality of our pizza(s) were also much better this time, and the garlic knots are amazing (Think Donald Trump hands out wide, amazing). I went with the prosciutto and sausage. Very fresh ingredients, and a thin crust that you can fold. Very tasty.

Bar: Yep, they have a full bar, and we indulged. The prices during Happy Hour can't be beat, and Yuengling on tap. Sold. 

Back to the service: There's a young kid (tall, thin, with short dark hair) that is probably the rudest, most arrogant son of a (word that rhymes with itch) that we've ever encountered. He's the kid that runs the pizzas out. Seriously, is he high, or just an asshole? He, along with gestapo host man, are two reasons why I might not ever return.

Very tasty (depends on which one you order) pizzas, and garlic knots. Full bar, with reasonable prices. Hit or miss service. Could be much higher than a two star review, if they were consistent.

May, or may not return next time I'm in IRB."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place is cool, dude! We had the crab cake and the shrimp and grits. Both were really good. Great drinks and the food was good too!I love this place. Food is amazing and the service is amazing. I would come here for breakfast every morning.The food was amazing and the prices are very reasonable! I will definitely be coming back! I had the pork chops and it was great. The pork was tender and flavorful. The sides were a good portion for the price.I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. I was disappointed with the Mac and cheese. The lobster was a little dry but was still good. The only thing I did not like was the sauce on the side. The sides were good too. I didn't like the fact that I was given a side of the fries. I didn't get to try the other side of the fries, but that was not a bad thing. I would go back if I were in the area.I love this place! I went for lunch today and it was amazing. The staff was friendly and the food was amazing. I had the fried chicken and was very impressed. I loved it.

Great drinks."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"I have always been a fan of this neighborhood chain restaurant. They always had good affordable food, lots of drink specials and in some locations, karaoke. I don't know about you, but a buzzed guy with a microphone in his hand is endlessly entertaining for me! Since I have had to change my diet and lifestyle due to diabetes, I love this place even more. For those of us trying to live a healthier lifestyle, Applebees gives you more choice than any other place that I have visited to date. I counted 12 different entrees or meal options that did not include eating a salad. Wonderful!

 This week I went there for lunch. They have a little green symbol next to all meals that have 550 calories or less. I had the Signature_Sirloin_with_Garlic_Herb_Shrimp_6_2011_high_Ressignature  sirloin with garlic shrimp, broccoli, potato and bruschetta and sliced almonds. The meat was seasoned well and cooked to a perfect medium. The potatoes were boiled but seasoned, there were only 3 pieces which was really enough and the broccoli was a little crisp and well seasoned as well. I was full, had no desire for dessert and the bill for 2 including tip was less than $25. 00. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The Manager came by twice to check on us and all in all it was a pleasurable experience. In general I am not a chain restaurant person but for me Applebees is a keeper. It's important to me to be able to go out and have a choice of more than salad or wraps. I wish more restaurants catered to people with special dietary needs. I also hope that Applebees continues to add more diet friendly options. If you are trying to watch your weight and your wallet this place is a must try. If you know of other places that have a decent range of options for diet conscious people, drop me a line and I will go check it out. Applebees

The chicken was well seasoned and moist. I would order it again. I also had the Chicken Bolognese. It was good, but I would not order it again. I also had the Scallops with Gorgonzola and Calamari. It was very good. The scallops were very tender, but the Gorgonzola was not as flavorful as it could have been. Overall, very good food, and very reasonable prices. I would go back.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My girlfriend and i were just recently up in Santa Barbara celebrating her birthday when I decided I would try this place out for her b-day dinner.  We had been wine tasting a little in the afternoon so we were hungry and I was looking to see if the reviews would live up to the hype.  Well they did, and more.  For whatever reason I was craving fish-n-chips and I couldn't have been more pleased with the way it looked and tasted.  Not overly saturated in oil... but crispy... and the fish just melted in your mouth.  The fries were somewhat forgettable but the sauces (Chipotle Ketchup & Creamy Dill Dip) that came with the plate made up for it.  It was more than I could eat but I managed to take it all in.  My girl had the chicken picatta and she could do nothing but rave how wonderful it tasted.  The vegetables that accompanied the dish were crisp and the fettuccini was perfectly cooked.  But the service was exceptionally good as well.  We received our food within 10 minutes and the temperature was perfect.  I don't mind waiting for my food to cool down a little as I chat and have a few sips of wine.  It's certainly beats having it come out cold and having to send it back.  But the staff was extremely nice and very accommodating on my birthday desert request.  Try the flour less chocolate cake.  You won't believe that it's only 8$.  We had a terrific meal.  Two very nice glasses of wine, and a dessert for only $66!!!  This was the most amazing part of our experience.  It tasted like it was going to be a lot more.  I love when that happens.  EVERYOne loves when that happens!  So yes, I would go back again and again; that's how I rate a restaurant."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Wasn't impressed as I thought I may be. Reading reviews sounds like today wasn't my luck of the draw. A couple of my friends and I decided to go check out the place, but from the start of the service it didn't seem like the rest of the meal would progress. 

Our waitress walked by our table a few times before finally getting our drink order, then 10 minutes later comes back with our drinks and ready to take our order. We ordered the elk burgers ""Medium"" as I have had an elk burger before. Our food isn't delivered by our waitress but another who accidentally was giving it to another table. 

The burger wasn't truly medium, it was more a medium Well to Well as there was no pink and a bit dry which was unfortunate because we ordered the HalfPounders. I got one small tomato slice and it looked like it was not fresh whatsoever. The food was ok, more or less mediocre for how this place was shaped up to be. 

But the mood ruiner was the waitress, they all huddled around the stand outside as we sat there and waited for refills. They were too busy talking about what they did last night and hair products as we tried to waive her down about ten times. She then gets us refills (or as she put it, Top it off). We had Cherry Cokes which in my world should be made fresh and not refill the same cup with watered down soda and ice on the bottom. 

We then had to waive her down just to get boxes as we say impatiently. Finally she brings the checks and takes forever before she could process them. 

Overall not exceptional service, poor service to say the least. The food was not as great as it has been made known as. I wouldn't recommend eating here, unless today was just an ""off"" day. I will say the waffle fries and marshmallow sauce was delicious."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The hostess was very rude and didn't seem to care. We waited for about 10 minutes for our server to come out, and finally got her attention. She was friendly and helped us out a bit. I ordered the seafood gumbo which was also very good. I also ordered the fried catfish which was very good. I will definitely come back for the seafood gumbo. I was there for the first time with a group of 12. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes. We ordered the cheesesteak, the red snapper, and the short rib. The cheesesteak was not great. It had a very thick crust and was hard to chew. It tasted like it was made with a mixture of old and new. The short rib was the best part of the meal. I would recommend this place for a quick dinner. We have been to this restaurant several times. It is a great place for a group of friends and family. The staff is always friendly and always checking on us. The food is always fresh and hot. My favorite dish is the fried chicken and the chicken tenders. The chicken tenders are the best. The sauce is amazing. The chicken is always hot and delicious. The chicken is cooked to perfection. The chicken is so tender and well seasoned. I have to order it every time. The sweet and spicy wings are my favorite. They are spicy and great. They are the best! The fried chicken is the best!

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We got here around 9:45 assuming we'd get sat quickly since it was so late and is open until 12. It was not packed but there were more people there than we expected when we got there, but cleared out a lot about 30 minutes later. They take your phone number and text you when the seats are ready so you can walk around which is one nice thing. We had to wait 20 minutes for bar seating when there were a ton of open seats at the bar and we actually wanted to sit at a table. We were told at first the wait was because there was only 1 server in the area which didn't make much sense after we sat down because we were seated at sushi bar which had 4 chefs working who essentially serve you your food and there were 2 servers running drinks. We ended up being there until 12 due to how slow it seemed to get sushi. It seemed a lot of the chefs weren't too interested in making eye contact to actually take orders to make sushi and were generally almost at the end of their shift and preoccupied with other things such as chatting and disappearing all together for a bit. One guy remained busy the whole time but he was not our server. Service can always be overlooked for me if the food is amazing. Sadly I thought it was subpar. The long rolls lacked in flavor, the fish itself didn't taste that great or fresh. Even my drinks I ordered from their cocktail menu I didn't like. First one was too bitter but drinkable. Second drink was so boozey I couldn't handle it and could not drink. If you want to get an overpriced cocktail with good amount of liquor I recommend the Thai mojito. For the price you pay, I was disappointed. Our server of drinks was very good and the guy clearing dishes and bringing water was also prompt and friendly."

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"It pains me to have to write this review but the experience needs to be documented and I have to stay true to the Yelp Mission!

My party had an absolute awful experience at this location.  We were a party of 4.  

it started from the moment that we were seated.  Seems like too may tables are crammed into this location.  We didn't think much of it at the moment as I like busy loud restaurants, but i think it contributed to some of the issues.

We ordered without an issue.  When the food was delivered, the waitress clearly didn't have a clue what she was doing.  The first two dishes made it onto the table, almost nocking over a drink.  The third dish was not made properly... we'll get to that.  The fourth dish was dropped, shattering glass chicken and rice over the feel of every table in the vicinity.  They were apologetic and offered to immediately remake the dish as expected.  While cleaning up the mess, the staff was literally sweeping over my shoes while I'm sitting at the dinner table.  A more tasteful approach would have been appreciated.

While waiting for the dropped dish to be remade, we noticed that the vegetable curry we ordered didn't have any curry in it!  It was literally just a plate of vegetables.  We asked the waitress about it and she insisted that it was correct.  When we called the manager over, she recognized the error immediately and had it corrected.

All of the rice was also dropped to the ground so they had to re-bring that as well.  We all asked for white... they brought brown.  At this point we were just laughing.

When the check came, the did comp the one dish that was dropped, but thats all.  I'm pretty surprised that we got a bill at all.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went here one night with friends, looking for something new in town when we heard about this place in the Epicurean hotel. The place is modern and sleek with comfortable leather chairs, place is really open and airy with lots of windows. Found out it is partly owned by the Bern's steakhouse across the street, but this ain't no Bern's although they do have an homage to Bern's which happens to be a steak sandwich and they do offer one dry aged steak from Bern's but it costs $75 for a 12oz cut. Otherwise the menu is not like Bern's at all, it has a lot of twists on old concepts, very foodie type of place. For example, the fish and chips appetizer is nothing you would fins in a British pub. It's actually tuna sashimi with tiny bits of potato chip things and topped with a foam and some slices of fired pickle. All the appetizers are fairly small. The rabbit appetizer was quite good.
The wait staff was very attentive and informed. the wine list at the time we were there was about 150 bottles but explained they will be getting much more, they variety was pretty good. They should just raid Bern's wine cellar one night. The food came out faster than I expected as well.
The entrees were a good size, not too small and not too much. My friend had the Lamb burger and he thought it was very good. I had the pork chop, which was much bigger than I expected, It was a damn good pork chop, tasted more like honey baked ham. The girls had rather good salads and monkfish and salmon were good but nothing special. One of our party has been here for lunch and stated the tuna casserole was much better than anticipated, and the escargot with risotto was unique but good.
The dessert menu looked very tasty but we decided to go across the street to the desert room. Overall a good experience and we will be back."

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Went here for their devour downtown menu. It was a nice experience, but very packed and the place is laid out kind of odd. It was hard to figure out where the front door was. When we walked in the host and hostess were both having an argument with some woman who wanted to be seated but all of her party wasn't there yet. As someone in customer service, I think I would have brought her to a private area to discuss the issue but instead both of them gave their attention to this angry woman while we waited to be acknowledged. We were sat right away and then after we were sat, since every person who walked in the door had to walk by our table, we learned that it was a 2 hour wait. The raspberry italian cream soda that I ordered wasn't very good, it didn't even taste like raspberry. It tasted like carbonated water, milk, and perfume. It also took 20 minutes for it to come from the bar because they were ""backed up"". During devour downtown, though, you would think they would have more staff than that. The wait staff was all plain clothed with no nametags so it was kind of hard to figure out who was working and who wasn't. The food was good. The pasta I ordered had a nice kick to it, and the dessert was the layered irish cream cake. It reminded me of my wedding cake and was absolutely delicious. I also had the potato corn and ham soup. It was good comfort food for a cold night, but I'm not sure if I would go back on a regular basis. The place was a little pretentious and hipster-ey for me. It's definitely a foodie place. They seemed like they really pack people in the place like sardines, which doesn't really make for a good atmosphere. Overall, I just wasn't that impressed. For the price we paid, and the price of their regular menu, I expected more."

The bread was nice and toasty on the outside and perfectly fluffy on the inside, and the butter was something special - unsalted butter seasoned with some sea salt and honey. I don't usually put much butter on bread, but I did here!

We also ordered the Kennett Square Mushroom Soup to share, and it was very good - deep mushroom flavor, and perfectly creamy! We'd heard it was good, and it did not disappoint!

My wife got their chicken dish for her main course, which was white meat cooked perfectly with sauce, and dark meat in spring rolls. The spring rolls weren't the best, but the white meat was delicious. Also, it came with some really good veggies, the best of which had to be the roasted brussel sprouts!

My main dish was the Icelandic cod, and I was blown away by how much I ended up enjoying every part of that dish! The cod and mussels were done well, and the mussel broth made everything taste amazing. There were radishes, turnips, brussel sprouts, and barley - everything was amazing with that broth! My wife's spring rolls were a tad bland, so we ended up dipping them into the broth.

Overall a great experience, not least of all being the staff. Our server Jason was very friendly and explained everything in detail. Everything about our experience was grand, and I would be happy to go again and try some other dishes!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I really don't like to eat meat, but I decided to try it for the first time and it was so delicious. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was so great. The only thing I would change is to have a more diverse menu. I really enjoy this place. The decor is a bit old-school and it's a bit loud. But I think the food is good and I would recommend it. I usually go for the chicken shawarma sandwich and the chicken shawarma is pretty good. The only thing I really hate is that it's not always clean. Otherwise it's really good. I have been going here for over 10 years and it is the best Italian restaurant in St. Louis. The food is amazing and the service is outstanding. I had the special pizza with the pesto pasta. The pasta was so good I took my family and I home. The pizza was the perfect size for two people and the sauce was delicious. The service is also great and the owner is the sweetest man. I always stop by for lunch after work. The food is great and the service is fast. The outdoor seating is a little on the small side but the food is good. I'm not a big fan of the old school diner vibe but I like the whole outdoor seating. It is a good place to hang out and eat. They have a great patio with a good view. I haven't tried the shrimp cocktail but I've had the tuna burger and salmon sandwich, so good. The sushi is also very good. It's not the best I've had here so far."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"So we were invited to visit Billy G's with my fiancé's grandparents and I wasn't even sure what to expect. I have heard of the Gianino families restaurants but have yet to try one...

When we came the first time it was a Friday or Saturday night and there was a very long wait. Exceeding an hour to sit inside, and to sit outside over and hour and a half. The outside patio is absolutely gorgeous. That is the best part about this place, in my opinion. It is absolutely gorgeous. Probably my second or third favorite restaurant patio in stl. 

The first time we went I ordered the grilled buffalo chicken sandwich with the sweet potato fries. The fries were pretty good, and the chicken sandwich was average. Not the best buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food too. The second time we ordered the pretzel bites and cheese and that was awesome. Probably the best pretzel and cheese I have ever had. Very tasty, and I absolutely recommend. Then for my meal I ordered the chicken modiga. It was pretty tasty. It came with a side salad or soup, I chose the salad. And then it came with a side of penne pasta, and you have the choice of alfredo or marinara sauce. The chicken modiga was really good, super rich and high calorie. The pasta was great. But I was not a fan of their side salad. It tasted like it was made in a large batch like an hour before I was served it... very soggy. I used to work in a salad bar, and salad like that just grosses me out. Maybe it would have been better fresh. Perhaps order the dressing on the side?

The service was pretty good both times. I think they did a pretty good job keeping up with refills. I really like their bar too, they make some pretty strong but delicious drinks. All in all, we will probably return to Billy G's.. decent place."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I really love everything about this place, the food is good, and the staff is friendly and accommodating.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Tenderloin, both were amazing.  The steak was tender and juicy, and the tenderloin was flavorful and full of flavor.  I also had the Chicken Fried Steak with the Shrimp and Grits.  It was very good, and I think that they have some of the best fried shrimp I have ever had.  I'm not sure if I've ever had fried shrimp, but I was very pleased with it.  I definitely recommend this place, and I can't wait to come back.  I highly recommend this place, and I hope they get to the point where I can order a second meal with my friends.  My only complaint is that I have never had any of the drinks here, but that is not really the point of this review.  The drinks were really good.  The service was great and the atmosphere was very laid back.  I would definitely come back here again.This place was absolutely fantastic. The food was amazing. We ordered the chili cheese pizza with pasta and the seafood pasta. Everything was amazing. The sauce was so flavorful and the bread was just perfect. The pizza was so good. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back.It's a great place for dinner. The service is fast and friendly. I would love to come here. They have a good bar and live music.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Just stopped to pickup something togo. Went inside to order and when a dude stepped up to the register he just stood there...no greeting or ""hey how you doing"" so since he was wearing whites i thought he might not be the cashier. After several uncomfortable seconds, I spoke and asked if he was waiting on me. He still didn't respond but I went ahead to start reading off my order. At the end I had some difficulty figuring out their card reader (one of those ipad POS systems) but finally figured it out. When I went to sign with my finger (as you do on this type of system) there was something gritty on the screen. It really grossed me out but I signed it. Then I asked if they had hand sanitizer (most restaurants there is a giant jug at the register) He directed me to their bus station ...for those of you who have never worked in a restaurant, this is where they take your dirty dishes after you finish eating. So, no thank you
Just saying, put hand sanitizer at you POS and get this guy off customer service. Been a while since anyone felt comfortable shaming me for being concerned about cleanliness in a restaurant. He told me Pointedly that they clean the card screen after ever use as he pulled out a wipe and cleaned the screen in front of me. I have several touchscreen in my home. This one was like the one the kids use that I have to take from them to clean each day because it becomes sticky and gritty from sticky fingers and crumbs. I know what a clean touch screen feels like and when I signed that screen it Was Not Clean.
Incidentally, had to walk beach to my car to get hand sanitizer that isn't stored next to a dirty dish tub. And FYI cashier, could read your tone loud and clear dude. I hope you can read mine. This is off the list of places that I will eat."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place really is fantastic. We had the crab cakes and the shrimp and grits. Both were fantastic. The service was amazing. The food was fantastic! We will be back.I'm so excited to come here!  I've been coming here for years and it's always been one of my favorite places to go to when I'm craving a good Chinese food.  I love the food here and the portions are huge.  The service is friendly and quick.  I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, but I will definitely come back for it.  I usually get a side of the pork and veggies.  The pork is tender and juicy.  The veggies are cooked perfectly and cooked just right.  I've tried the chicken and beef dishes and both were very good.  

I also like that the owner is a nice guy and he's always on top of things.  I just wish they had a better selection of Chinese food for a reasonable price.I love this place. The food is very fresh and the staff is so friendly. I always get the pho, which is always tasty and the spring rolls are delicious. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. There are a lot of options to choose from. I don't eat in or take out, but if you're a vegetarian, there are plenty of options.I've never been to this location but I've been a few times.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went there this last weekend and ordered a garlic bagel with jalapeño spread.  The bagel was nothing special which is to be expected, the spread is where the magic is.  except for being jalapeño this had a minus 5 on the flavor scale.  no spice what so ever and it tasted almost sour like the cream cheese was bad.  I ate two bites and threw away the rest.  

The worst part were the two girls behind the counter.  First it states you must wear a mask when you enter. so I walked all the way back to my car to get mine.  then upon entering there was a guy, who already had his food, that the girls obviously new and were chatting it up. he wasn't wearing a mask.. fine no biggie.  then one girl took my order went back to chatting and then when the guy started coughing I just walked out for a bit.  came back in after a few minutes and I think she remembered I had an order and finally started it.  fine, what ever, just give me my food so I can leave.  the kicker was that they started to get busy and the other girl was still talking to the guy.  She was wearing gloves and scratching her hair and playing with the backs of her earrings, and at one point picked at a bump on her face.  then the guy realized she needed to get back to work she turned around and STARTED MAKING FOOD!!! didn't change her gloves.   I couldn't stand it and I told her that the whole purpose to wearing gloves is to keep the part that touches food clean, and that touching your hair and face isn't sanitary.   I used to own a cafe and this would be a health code violation.  she said okay and turned around and KEPT MAKING FOOD. yuck!! only go there if like licking other people's faces."

We got the crawfish and shrimp and the fries. The crawfish and shrimp were tasty. The fries were ok. The crawfish and shrimp were a little overcooked. My brother got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. I got the pork chop and it was good but nothing special. The potatoes were great. The pork chop was pretty good. The shrimp and grits were good. The only reason I gave it a 5 star rating was because the waitress was very slow. I was a little concerned about her but she seemed really friendly and it made the experience. We'll definitely be back!Was looking forward to this place to finally get a chance to eat here. I was a little worried that they wouldn't have the best looking menu, but we were a little disappointed. I ordered the crawfish and shrimp and was not disappointed. I would say that the quality of the food was not great, but the service was great. The food was good and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back for more.One of the best places to eat in the area.  Great food and service.  The service was quick and friendly.  The food is delicious.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Talula's Garden earns distinction for not only its chic décor, delicious seasonal menu, wonderful outdoor display, and international cheeses but also for their astute staff and stellar service! 

Upon the introduction to the cute brioche buns with sun dried tomato butter, my dinner mates and I bit into a puff of heaven: buttery (but not overwhelmingly so!) pieces of warmness that just melted onto the palate. We were awestruck for a moment but after we recovered we just kept glancing at all the plates passing us by since we were seated at the communal table near the cheese bar and kitchen. We saw a plate with at least 10 buns with envy and were clearly ogling and contemplating: should we shamelessly ask for more buns (ala Oliver Twist style of course!) and lo and behold the waitress dressed in quaint country frock immediately placed another plate, smiled as us, and left us to devour the buns gleefully! 

The second example of their amazing service happened when one of the dinner mates felt increasingly tired and sick to the point where she was thinking about leaving before the entrée came out. We asked for hot water with lemon to hopefully revive her and it arrived promptly. Additionally when she finally decided to leave right after the entrée arrival, the waitstaff quickly doggy-bagged her crab pasta along with 2 complimentary brioches! How thoughtful! 

Now onto the food: 
- the mushroom soup was amazing symphony of earthiness and nuttiness with the Kennett Square mushrooms and pine nuts that sang well together. 
- the lamb meatball was not gamy and complemented the roasted eggplants harmoniously
- the crab pasta was not overwhelming and lightly done so that one can keep eating the perfectly al dente pasta forever
- the scallops was artfully arrange with the roasted potatoes, carrots, and parsnips and swirled with a delightful sauce that made it light and filling at the same time

The food, décor, and staff were all thoughtfully done that just works well to give a diner the best experience possible in all areas!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Yakitori Boy is probably best known for the curry shrimp. It is a simple dish, but one of the best in the area. The egg rolls are the best, and the curry sauce is amazing. I have been here twice in the last 2 weeks. This is my new favorite restaurant.I was looking for a quick dinner and stopped by the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the chef's special, the pork chop with ham and the chicken cutlet with mushrooms. The portions were huge and the prices were reasonable. The chef's special was very flavorful and flavorful.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I don't believe the name is derived from the street name, since this is the second location of Berix in town...  

Anyway, I stopped in for lunch the other day and had the doner kebab.  Please note this has nothing to do with the more familiar shish kebab we all know.  It's a sandwich, plain and simple.  I have never had this dish in the US, only in Germany.  Over there it's callled doner kebap and there are lots of places that specialize in it.  It was always cut from a skewer and it had the look of stacked pork steaks.  The taste was much stronger there (not a surprise). Heavier on the garlic, I think.  The version here is pretty much a gyro on bread.   It was very good bread - billowy and soft, and the ingredients were all quite tasty.  It was big - probably enough for two to split due to the big roll.   The best part might have been the price at $4.79.  It's cheaper than a subway footlong!!!! Plus about 15 times more tasty.  

As noted in the other review, this place is probably the nicest fast food joint in town.  Beautiful stonework on the fireplace (yes fireplace).

Counter service was a little laid back, but okay I guess.  Not sure what would happen if I came when they were busy...  

Language barrier?   Well the first thing she said to me was...well I'm not sure, but it wasn't English.  I gave her my typical dumb look.  After that, we got along fine.  

Some of the other dishes looked pretty tasty.  Breakfast is served, although it starts at 9, which is kind of late, really.  I guess Bosnians like to sleep in more than my 4-yr-old daughter.

If you want to try bosnian in a familiar fast food setting, this is a good place to start.   Maybe do a little menu research before you arrive."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I wandered across the existence of this place and we decided to try it out. I was pretty impressed. The food was delicious. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and great. The only thing that was disappointing was that the fry was on the cold side. The fries were also not crispy enough. The place was clean and nicely decorated. 

I would definitely come back.We came here for a quick lunch and were happy to find a great place to eat. We were seated immediately upon arrival, which is the only reason we gave it a 5. The place is clean and has a nice atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The only thing we did not like was the price. We got a $5 oyster appetizer and a $8 seafood platter. We ended up getting $30 worth of food for the two of us. The platter was small, but well worth the price. The oysters were a little on the salty side but they were very fresh and tasty. The rice and beans were very good and the beans were well seasoned. The mahi mahi was very good, and I would recommend it if you're in the mood for sushi. The beef was a little dry, but not horrible. I would recommend the shrimp and grits as an appetizer. The shrimp and grits were also very good. The shrimp and grits were cooked very well. Overall, the mahi mahi was great and the shrimp and grits were very good. My only complaint was that the shrimp and grits were very salty. The food was a little on the salty side, but not so salty that I ended up eating it. The grits were not really"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"To provide context, I try to avoid gambling as much as possible, love arcades, and have never been to a Dave and Buster's prior to this but am a Chuck E. Cheese kid at heart. I came here on a slow Tuesday night with a group of 38 giddy but uninspired teenagers from deep Brooklyn eager to say how lame it all was, and 7 fellow chaperones who were just trying to get through this end of the year trip. To my surprise, the place was massive - there was easily 50-75 stations/games available with bright lights that made you feel like you were in a casino but instead of winning money you won dinky street fair prizes and overpriced sweets - the ""candy store of gambling"", my partner calls it. We were given the party room in the back to eat first - pizza bagels, mac and cheese, crispy chicken bites, sliders, and fries were available (with salads to order) buffet style. The wait staff was courteous and nice, efficiently replacing the food when it went empty. They also gave us boxes to take the leftovers back to the hotel, which the kiddos lit up at the sight of - ""WHAT? THAT'S LIT, YO I'MMA EAT THAT AT 4 AM"". The sliders were tender in a flavourless way, the chicken was fine but could have used more spices in the breading, pizza bagels tasted like the frozen microwave dinner variety, the fries lacked potato-essence, and the mac and cheese was fine, but a sprinkling of salt and pepper were absent. Although the food was subpar, everyone was genuinely kind in their interactions with my screaming students, and they get 3 stars for actually accomplishing the impossible - getting 38 teenagers to say they had fun. Skee ball, ticket roulettes, trivia, giant life-size Rock-Em Sock-Em robots, Mario Kart, Gran Turismo, Terminator, shooting games, air hockey, etc. The options were endless, and we really had a great time. It's made me reconsider these places and seems like a fun place to get drunk and bring on a date."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My review is mostly a reflection of our waiter and management, not the food quality.
We had a Friday reservation for 6 people at 7pm. We arrived early and were able to get seats at the bar while we waited for the others to arrive. When they did, we were promptly seated at our reservation time. We ordered some additional drinks and a few appetizers. We ordered Meatballs and Ricotta, and Caprese. We had already ordered the Ricotta board while waiting at the bar. 
We were now ready to order a few entrees. We ordered a ""GAAAHLIC"" pizza, a ""MARGHERITA"" pizza and a ""LA MORTADELLA"" pizza. The waiter instead put in a ""ALLA CARBONARA"" pizza which was the next pizza down on the menu. It was sent back and we just had the other two. The manager then came over and apologizes that we ""ordered the wrong pizza"". That was not the case. The waiter either heard wrong, or entered it wrong. 
Now for the check issue. Two of us had ice tea. They also had 3 refills. Each of the refills were also on the check. I questioned the waiter and he told us that he was new and that they charged for each one. A few minutes later, he came back and said that they were free refills and would take them off of the check. After waiting for several minutes, he dropped off a new check that still had the refills on it. Neither he nor the manager were within sight, so I left the cash in with the check and we left. On the way out, we bumped into him at the hostess station and told him that the money was on the table and that the check was still wrong. He actually argued with me and told me that it was not the same check. I did not want to start a confrontation and just left. 
I dine out almost every night and usually with friends on Friday and Saturday. This was the first time that I have not left a tip."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"3.5.......
My reasons-
I ordered a small side salad with shrimp and I got a salad with the shrimp and the salad dressing.  The salad dressing was good but the shrimp was so salty it made it difficult to eat.  The shrimp was fresh and it was tender and cooked to perfection.  I had a salad that was also very tasty and I had a salad with spinach and tomatoes.  The spinach was great, but I wish there was more.  I don't like spinach so I ordered it with spinach instead.  The spinach was a little too salty for my liking.

I ordered the lunch special with a side of fries and a drink.  I got the chicken and waffles and it was delicious.  The waffles were not cooked to perfection and I was a little disappointed.  The fries were the best part of the meal and were a nice touch.  I don't really like the chicken tenders so I thought it was good.

The drink was good and the service was good.  I was very disappointed with the service.  The waiter was very friendly but didn't seem very attentive to the tables and was very distracted and I was surprised by the fact that he didn't say anything.  The drink was good and I did enjoy it but it was a little sweet.  The waiter was a little slow to get my food.

I will definitely be back for lunch.  The service is good but I will probably ask for the server to come over and ask if everything is good to make sure that my meal is good.  I'm a bit disappointed.  I did enjoy the food so I didn't like the drinks but it"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I've read all the reviews on the ""Pig"" and most seem fairly honest and accurate, if not mixed from one extreme to the other.  Management would do well to stabilize some of the problems mentioned by others and would be an easy fix - i.e. ""spotty service"", ""inconsistent food"", and ""cleanliness"". 

Both the ribeye and the filet mignon are excellent.  Believe it or not, some of the best steaks I've had in a long while.  The loaded baked potato on the side was as good as you would expect, the snap beans (separate order) were also good, but at $27 per steak a little salad on the side would have been nice, if not expected.  Lava cake for dessert was a little too rich, even for my sweetness addiction.  

A post-dinner trip downstairs for some live music is a totally different scenario.  It's a little cramped and ""dingy"" (which is OK for a bar scene, not for dinner).  There were a few people eating but I can't really enjoy a meal in a dark, noisy environment.  Cover charge is $5 for pretty good music, usually rock 'n roll.  Expect it to be a little loud in there between the band and a few patrons ""feelin' the music"".  Draft beer is $5 and well drinks are $7 and served in a small rocks glass.  I'm not a heavy drinker but at $7/pop my gin & tonics can add up rather quickly.   The key to service in the bar is to just ""grab"" a server as they fly by but you have to be quick.

Lunch is a totally different scenario.  Haven't had their ""famous"" hamburger yet because I can't seem to get off their fantastic Monte Cristo.  Service is great for lunch - does not seem to have the inconsistency the night crowd has.

If you've never been to the Bunganut, you might want to try lunch first.  It's got it's quirks overall, especially at night, but 3/5 stars might be an accurate score."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Alright. My name is Jen and I love the food. I will say that the service was horrible. Our server was very slow. The food took forever to come out. The food was mediocre at best. The only thing good was the coffee. If I was to give it another chance I would give it a 3. I did get a free appetizer on my first visit. I will say that the food was not bad. But the service was terrible. We were very rushed. We had to wait another 10-15 minutes for a table, which was not a big deal. We sat at the bar for a good 10 minutes before a server came to our table. We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were not given any of them. We asked for a few of our drinks, they never came. We asked for a few of our drinks to go and we were not given any of them. We asked for some of our checks and they never came. After a few minutes of waiting we finally received our check.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went here after reading reviews online and found it lives up to the good reviews.  We dined inside on the ground floor, as there was a wait for the balcony and upper floor tables.  There isn't much ambience down there, but the wonderful fragrance of the boiling spices is ambience enough!  

We were seated immediately at about 3pm on a Sunday.  The service was friendly and attentive, but not fast - we waited for our food and check.  Drink refills were done promptly, though.

Never having tried a crawfish, I asked if I could just buy one to try, even though I'm usually not a ""seafood"" eater.  The server brought one out ""on the house"" and then had to show me how to eat it.  LOL.  After getting over the initial shock of having to peel off its shell with the legs still attached, I found the tail was really good, very spicy and flavorful, not at all fishy, but was a lot of trouble to eat.  The juice from the head was more spicy, and I could detect a bit of fishiness, although not overpowering.  But the thought of sucking the heads of those little things was something I couldn't put my heart into.  I ended up going with a cajun sampler that had several dishes I wanted to try, and just got a side of the potatoes and corn which came with a bonus crawfish!  

Diners at our table enjoyed the Popcorn Shrimp, Jambalaya, Red Beans & Rice, Maque Choux, Blackened Chicken.  Everything was wonderful, and our table was close to the action so we got to watch the gentlemen hard at work preparing huge platters of oysters and boiled crawfish as fast as they could go.  The seafood was actually very pretty, and I really wanted to try to get pictures of the platters of oysters and crawfish, because they were so colorful.  

Overall this was a terrific NOLA dining experience and true seafood lovers would probably enjoy it even more."

It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it. The only downside is that the place is small and loud, so I think you're better off going to a more intimate restaurant or a bar. However, it's a very fun place to hang out and get some drinks, and have a drink, and eat some food. This place is super cute and has a great atmosphere. They have some great specials, and they do a great job of offering to make your meal delicious. I've never had a problem with any of the food here, and the portions are really big. My only regret is that I haven't tried their breakfast menu yet. I will definitely be back. Best Thai food in Tampa. We went during the lunch rush. The food was very good.

The food, when we finally got it was actually very good! The have a limited menu, which is good because they are focusing on only a few things. We both had the fish and chips which was excellent. It was not greasy and had a good crust and the came apart neatly and nicely. The pricing $13.00 for each person seemed very fair and good.

However, service was pretty bad. We were seated for about 15 minutes before anyone noticed us, and we were sat in between a bunch of other people when there were more tables of the same size available that would not cram people on top of each other. Service was very slow and we waited a very long time to have our order taken, to have our drinks delivered, and to have our food delivered. Luckily, the food was not served cold. We didn't order soda, but a lot of other people next to us complained about flat soft drinks. It seem even though they knew it was a problem, they kept serving people who sent it back - either some miscommunication between servers or they were hoping people would not complain. The other people near us also complained about really slow service. When we were ready to pay we had our credit card out and made sure the server didn't drop the bill and run.

The people next to us tried to order cocktails, and the server didn't really seem to know that much about the drinks, etc - but they eventually sent over a bar tender to talk to that couple which was a smart move!

Considering there are so many other options in New Hope, I would not likely go back. However, if you are nearby this part of the main drag and it doesn't look busy, then you will get some good food. Perhaps if they hire more staff they can eliminate the service issues."
