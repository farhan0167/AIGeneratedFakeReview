Restaurants,4.0,OR,Best. In. STL. And it's about time. You can't make a wrong decision here and it's always worth any wait. I live 40 minutes away and it's worth the drive too.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Great food, but management needs to focus on the service.   Simple things like delivering forks, napkins and drinks to the table before the food is served would be great!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"These are some of the best burritos in town. The people working here are always polite and fast, and each time the food is incredible. I will definitely keep coming back."

Delivery is quick

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went here because we heard it was the best po boy place in new orleans. It was just packed with tourists, the bread was so soggy, and the shrimp just was not fried crispy."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,More of a tourist site than a place to go for value and good food.  Don't get me wrong as the shell fish is good and fresh but very expensive and terrible atmosphere.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is probably the best sushi restaurant I have gone to multiple times. Great sashimi and rolls, and there are rare items that you can try that can feel like an authentic japanese experience."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Overpriced. The food is obviously not fresh --- even the ""fresh fish"" selection. The view is the only reason to go. Save your money and taste buds and go to Snapper's down the street!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Average food AT BEST. Very little flavor and came out a little cold. Service is awful. Our server was rude and only came over maybe twice during our whole meal. Would definitely not recommend.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The best time to go here is during lunch. They have the best lunch menu and it comes with a spring roll and soup. The sticky rice with mango is the best sweet treat.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Tourist trap with mediocre beignets! The only reason I didn't give it a five star is because of the horrible quality of the beignet. The beignet was light in color, the beignet"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,The combination gumbo barely had any chicken and crawfish in it.  Went in with high expectations as this restaurant was on Bourbon St.  Was disappointed with the Gumbo but the Fish Po-Boy was excellent.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Great service and food! The crabmeat was tender and delicious, the shrimp was so fresh and the garlic shrimp was really good. I had the Tuna and it was fantastic. I don't eat meat and I love tuna so I was really happy"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,This place is a great option for a quick bite or a drink. The service is top notch and the food is good too. It's a fun place to meet up with friends and have a good time. It's also a place to stop
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Nice experience here. Staff was very nice and helpful. Food was delicious. Great atmosphere. Was my first time here and I loved it! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick (and cheap) lunch.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I ordered a double-double (double-double is almost like a triple-double) and it was delicious! The meat was tender and flavorful. The sides were equally tasty, but the fruit was so sweet, I was a little disappointed."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"good service. food was not bad but was not made to be a star. 

I would like to be able to specify what I want on the menu. 

I ordered a medium and my co-workers ordered a half chicken"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food was okay. I ordered the red snapper and it wasn't fresh, had a slight smell to it. My kids burgers were dry not tasty. The kids chicken fingers were delicious. Server was great but food took way to long to come out."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"So disappointed. Came here for mine and my husbands 13th anniversary. We always get bruschetta and braised beef tortellini. To our shock, they no longer carry either. Very disappointed. Just seems as though menu items keep disappearing. Come on Olive Garden get it together."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Excellent!!! Food was great!  I love this place and will continue eating here since I live in Smyrna. Great atmosphere. Not some crappy steak house. Your normal pricing as Japanese Steak Houses are. Great portions.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Many items on menu not available. They offered the cheaper dishes as substitutes without reducing price, but when we asked others at higher price, they charged us the difference, even only $2. So many little pieces  hided in dishes not good for BBQ."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,This is a fun place to go for good food. We came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and we're not let down at all. The prices are reasonable and the staff is super attentive. If you haven't been here you should !!!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Very good sushi with good prices. My only complaint is that service can be spotty. It's been real good a few times and not so good other times. The food has always very  good. The spicy tuna and jalapeño roll are my favorites.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"The Eagle has nailed fried chicken. I also love their mac and cheese. The service is terrific as well. I'm a big fan. ENDORSEMENTS:

– Great food, great service, great atmosphere."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,This is a simple diner that provides a great home cooked meal. The cheese fries are delicious and the coffee is excellent. The service is fast and friendly. The only drawback is that the only thing they serve is french fries and they don't have any
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Lackluster food. Not bad, but the food was disappointing. I had the bean and cheese burrito, which consisted of black beans and cheese. I had the green beans with sour cream with cheese and rice, which had rice and beans."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,went there on a Saturday morning for a quiet lunch. The place was full and we got seated right away. The service was good. The place itself was a bit small. I didn't want to share a table with a group of people.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The BEST food I've had in 5 years. The sauces, the service, and the atmosphere are the only thing I'm regretting. My husband has never been disappointed and his favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. We have been coming here since they opened"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Los of beers in bottles and on tap.

thye give you pint glasses on some nights, and as a result every bar uptown serves beer occaisionaly in pint glasses advertising this bar.

They don't cheap on the quality, either.  Gotta wonder how they pay for that..."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Classic Diner has all the traditional diner food which they add a little bit of their own style to. Their toasts are made of very good quality bread, their scrapple is the best srapple I've ever had so far and their staff is really friendly!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever dined at. Very unique combinations, and the freshest nigiri/sashimi around. Our waiter was Effrin and he was fantastic. He was knowledgeable and friendly, without being annoying or pushy. I will be a repeat customer."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Sushi is awesome and so is the terriyaki,Friendly staff and really fun for parties. My family and i really enjoy this place. My favorite roll is the sugar daddy. I would recoomend this place to anyone.Can be a bit spendy but overall a great place."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Love this place! This is one of our top 3 restaurants. The food is amazing and we have never been disappointed. The restauarant itself is very cozy, but that is part of the experience. We have been here multiple times and will continue to go!"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"The food is pretty good. I had the chicken sandwich, which was good. The fries were average. The manager was nice, but didn't want to talk about the food. I had a beer and a burger."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I just went to Sakura and sure enough, there was a very small line. I was seated at the bar, and when the bartender asked if I wanted to try the sake, I was like no way, I was so full of dinner."
Restaurants,2.0,CG,A little disappointing tonight.  The waitresses were friendly and the food was decent.  I was debating getting the Braised Beef Brisket.  I ordered the Chicken with Broccoli and the spaghetti with eggplant.  The chicken was really overcooked
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Super delicious pav bhaji and samosa. The pav bhaji was so good I am going back for more. The samosa is more like dosa and I am going to order that. The jeera was not too sweet and the gravy was good
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Good old times comfort food. The chicken strips are the best in the area, but the gnocchi is also a winner. Chicken teriyaki is as good as ever. Half and half rolls are good, as well."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I went right during lunch as it opened and there was no wait. The soft shell crab is great but a little on the pricey side, well worth it though. We also had chargrilled oysters and true to what everyone has said - buttery and garlic-goodness!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Such an awesome dinner. I got the chicken fried chicken and duck fat tater tots. I was so impressed and the service was amazing! 

I was so happy we found this place during our short trip to Nashville, I couldn't have been happier with the meal."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Small little hole in the wall. Flamed broiled burger.  I could have gone to Burger King.  Sorry they might try hard but this is obviously and inexperienced restauranteur wanna be.  Not trying to be mean just a reality check.  Nothing special here.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Gorgeous building and interesting concept. Mostly a beautiful large and fancy cafe (which was hopping at late lunch time on Friday), a small and fancy book store, Aesop store, Warby Parker store and upscale home decor gift store selling John Derian and French pottery etc etc."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place was amazing!  The food was absolutely wonderful, everyone at our table got something different, and it was all delicious.  We unanimously decided it was the best BBQ we've found to date. Will definitely be back the next time we are in town!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"My favorite place for a nice meal. The filet mignon was pretty good. The shrimp was also good. I ordered the mussels, oysters, and clams. They were all good. The mussels were very good, the oysters"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Shame on duchene bar and the place!
The bar was very small, the menu was not on the menu. The menu was not very long. The food was good, but not great. The owner was nice, but slow to come out and clear the"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I've been on a little bit of a diet and haven't really felt that way yet. I have been eating a lot of meat and I am loving it. I'm not a huge fan of the burgers but I do love the fries so when I was craving
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My son loves coming here! They have a good selection of food and the service is great! They are generous with their food for take home and for take out. The only thing I would change is that the ice cream is a little too sweet for my liking,"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,One of the best casino restaurants on the strip. The food was delicious and the drinks were great. The atmosphere is very family friendly and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Everyone you meet is very polite and welcoming. The atmosphere is great.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Dragos is outraged they talk about the pigs and the animals getting slaughtered! I am so glad I decided to go here. The food is outstanding and they have a nice, friendly atmosphere. Order a bowl of their pasta to go, and it is perfect! I"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Excellent authentic Mexican at a decent price.  No frills dining room and dining experience, but great value.

If you're planning a lunch visit, expect to wait a long time for a table (or possibly not get one at all) unless you're able to get there before noon."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I heard all the hype about this place... I mean I don't really get it. The food is good but nothing I'm dying to go back for... service kind of sucked , forgot stuff ,brought everything out at once ... I'm in no rush to go back"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We have used Pappy's Smokehouse for tons of catering events at my place of Biz..  prices are great, everything comes hot and ready to eat!! This is one of the easiest places to get catering.   
My co-workers can't wait until we have it again!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is the best place to get a burger in Indiana, besides the macaroni chasse burger at The Cheesecake Factory. Also I recommend the Cajun fries, they are delicious. The crew is very friendly and the place is very clean. It's quality food for a cheap price."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Got stuck in elevator. And then blamed by staff that it was our fault.  Staff member in sweat pants escorted us out the front door; very classy. Disappointing in the venue and the staff, as I'm getting married and looking for a downtown Tampa venue #stafffail"
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"We were disappointed on our first visit; especially with these reviews. Had the fried chicken sandwich which was just ok. Heuvos Rancheros was not anything special either. The corn, crab chowder was delicious. Staff very friendly. Can't say I'd be back with the other options out there."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,If you like total salt and pepper you need to try this. I have never had a good frozen pizza and it has to be good. The crust is thin and crispy but the toppings are also pretty good. I would definitely go back if I could.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The five stars is for the fact that this place is open 24/7, and you can get food fast. The food is good, and the prices are very reasonable. I recommend the chicken chili, and the cheese burger. They have a 3-4 page"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Amazing Tacos from 2. 50usd to 4. 25usd. Great customer service and professional staff. Have a craving for Mexican? Go for the tortillas. I will be back! ENDLESS. ENDLESS. ENDLESS. ENDLESS.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE their LIFESTYLE. I LOVE their service and all the people that work there. They also have a really nice outdoor area. I have been to the bar many times, but I haven't been back in ages."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The food & the prices were both very good. The food was quite good and the prices were very reasonable. The service was good as well. The staff were a bit slow but that's to be expected with so many people in the restaurant.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Everything about this place was good. Our server was attentive and nice, our food was unbelievable (a little fattening, but that's okay) , and the restaurant itself was beautiful. What more could you want? If you're thinking of making a reservation -- do it, and thank me later."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great place. Things I ordered:

Small plate: fried alligator-- the best I've ever had. 

Entree: Louisiana cochon-- eat and every bite was amazing. 

I shall return. 

Tip: Don't sit by the back bar (where all the food comes out)-- you'll just want to eat everything. 

Tip 2: make reservations."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The pineapple margarita that Leah made me was soooo delicious! The short rib queso was incredible, but the tacos were ok. The taco meat was a little tough and tasted off. Ambiance was awesome and the service was fast! Leah was great, attentive, and fun to chat with!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"It was located across the street from where I was staying. My wife had heard about it and we decided to give it a try. There was a waiting period, but it was worth it. The food was really good. This is our second morning and wedding anniversary."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,Went there at dinner time on Saturday night. Service was good but the food was borderline awful. Not fresh at all and I'm not so sure that it would have tasted good even if it was. Definitely would not return. 2 stars only because everyone was very nice.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This is a decent pizza shop. I'd avoid the pies if you're not in a hurry. The pizza is good. The pizza is light and crisp. The crust is good. The sauce is tasty. The pizza does not come with a crust. 

"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"If I lived in Reno, I would live here. The staff was so friendly, the food is incredible and the atmosphere is perfect. The waitress, Judy, was really nice. I'm so glad I took the time to stop by my favorite restaurant."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"We had two lobster rolls with the two sides: a hunk of Italian sausage, a hunk of shrimp dumplings, and a hunk of shrimp and crab cakes. I liked the shrimp and crab cakes, but the hunk of Italian sausage didn't really"
Restaurants,1.5,CG,"They charge for an ice cream cone but only charge for the price of the cone, so you can't get a full cone in the store. They have not been around in a very long time and it's a shame considering there are a lot of good ice cream cones"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This place is awesome! Whenever I come here I always order the ribs and the beef brisket. The food is so fresh. The ribs are amazing. The beef brisket is so tender and juicy. The fries are so good too. I've never had to wait for
Restaurants,3.0,CG,This was a return visit for my wife. She loved it! We are already planning a second visit. The bread is so fresh and fresh bread. The bread was fresh and succulent. The staff was friendly and helpful. The menu was full of suggestions for us.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I had the vanilla cake creme brûlée and my boyfriend had the bananas foster bread pudding. They both were amazing! We had the nicest server! I can't remember his name-but he also works at Starbucks! When we visit New Orleans again, we will definitely make this a must stop!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This a good choice for a fast, casual, cheap lunch in a clean setting. It is amusing to see the school bus facade inside the restaurant. I ordered the grilled chicken tacos and didn't really care for the flavor. I would try a different protein next time. Friendly staff."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Great service and expansive menu! Sadly I don't think they understand what gluten intolerant means, so it did cost me a lot more than the tab. It was a whole night of pain before a super early important day at work. I would go back, but I'd better not."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Excellent chicken and sausage gumbo! Dark spicy redux! Hard to find gumbo without seafood and this was great! Fresh garden salad. Wonderful service...from the host to the server! Glad I didn't listen to the reviews! There was a slight ""stale beer smell"" but that is NOLA! Cheap prices too!!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Went in on a Friday morning just after 9. Was seated immediately. Our server was very sweet. The food was decent and came out quickly. The place got busier as our meal progressed but it didn't effect our service or experience at all. I'll be back again for sure.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I was in Tampa for a conference and decided to try The Rusty Pelican for lunch. The decor, the view, the service, and the food were all top notch. I ordered the calamari (the mango sriracha is fabulous!) and the coconut shrimp. Fast and friendly service."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"today we got the pork, bacon and egg sandwich and it was the best sandwich we've ever had. It has a great flavor and the pork was so fresh and tasty. The egg was so fresh and some of the best eggs I've ever had. The turkey and bacon was"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Disappointed Dave took the grouper dish and didnt cook it right, he was being rude. I will never recommend this place. This is a longtime business for me and I feel like I have to leave because of this.

I will never come back again to this establishment."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Can't say enough about the great service, friendly and knowledgeable staff, the food was so good, and the drinks were outstanding. I will definitely be back for sure. Thanks for making me feel welcome. END

Restaurants,4.5,OR,We love coming here to get our bubble tea fix! Our favorites are the: Vanilla Milk Tea and Taro. (Both at 75% sweet are perfect.) We also devoured their Savory Moon Cake! It's a pretty small establishment with a little seating indoors and a pair of tables & chairs outdoors.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Loved our experience at party fowl!! Excellent service!! Great for a group in a fun setting and easy to cut loose and have a great time! The food was DELISH!! We had just about every appetizer on the menu and the lollipops were a favorite!! Can't wait to go back!!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Getting a table at this place is like winning lottery - but it's worth the wait because you won't be disappointed with the food, ambience, or service. I'd definitely recommend getting their Hummus, Salatim, and most definitely a dessert like their chocolate kanofi irrespective of anything else you might consider."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Food was a mixed bag.  My wife order the tacos and I ordered the chicken kebobs.  My wife's were good and mine were so-so.  The prices is what makes them 2-3 stars.  Drinks saved them from 2 stars.  Food quality does not warrant the price.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I start my search for a bike in Port Townsend. This location is perfect. They are a great bike shop and everyone is so nice and helpful. The staff is great. The bike itself is super comfortable and looks awesome. The price is reasonable and the service is great.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,If your looking for a great seafood restaurant in the area you can't go wrong with this place. They serve up some great seafood and the prices are very reasonable and reasonable.

We left feeling like a million dollars and with a munchy belly! The food was delicious and the"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,WOW !!! My sister took a picture of the interior of the restaurant. She was impressed by the staff and the food. She said the service was fantastic. She was very impressed by the quality of the food. The food was a little on the pricey side but she said the service
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is my third time visiting the restaurant. The food was delicious. The staff was very attentive and friendly. We ordered the seafood platter and the steak was a perfect size. Would highly recommend this restaurant. Great service and food. ENDURED ME.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Tried this today for the first time after reading the review by Jason S.GREAT!  Excellent place for a quick breakfast sandwich. Clean store , friendly employees. I will never get a breakfast sandwich from DD or Wawa again. I am looking forward to trying more food here in the future."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,This is what $8 worth of take out sauce looks like. My husband asked for a large guacamole (the tiny black container next to a small bottle of ibuprofen just for size reference) and a large salsa (the white container). The guacamole has enough for two spoonfuls smh. Got me again.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,One of my favorite places to eat in IV during my undergrad! The pho is always good and their customer service is excellent. The lady who works there is friendly and even remembered my usual order. I will definitely be stopping by the next time I'm in the Santa Barbara area.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The quality of their BBQ beef has really gone downhill. :( In the early days it used to taste like little bits of heaven. Now it tastes like gristly, rubbery dog food. It hurts me to slam my favorite restaurant like this. Apparently someone there is trying to cut costs."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Great amazing innovative clever food! It's a pretty small place but its flavor combos are amazing! Quite expensive but worth it for very special occasions. Shrimp and grits were soooo good and with great depth of flavor! Loved it! Totally recommend for all foodies! Plus they are vegan and vegetarian friendly!
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"This used to be my favorite place. Then things took off as it was a chain with a lot of bad reviews. People coming here for a quick lunch were reluctant to come back. I've tried to get more people back to it, but no luck."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"If I could give it 10 stars I would. I love the decor and the restaurant but the food is just a little to well done. The fried chicken is overcooked, the mashed potatoes are a little hard, the mashed potatoes are a little hard and the broccoli is just not cooked"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Wouldn't honor the T-Mobile Tuesday phone contract and pay the $5 per month late fee. I've had to pay $200.00 this month to get my phone. I just had to go to the phone store today to pick it up. I have to go through a lot of hoops
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"favorite place for breakfast!! the morning breakfast is my favorite, the afternoon breakfast is a little more pricey, but has a wide variety of food. I have been to the restaurant several times and have always been satisfied. It's a little bit of a hike from my apartment, but has a"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Love this place! Taco salad is wonderful and the owner is so nice. We got the steak taco salad and it was awesome. I love the decor and the decor is different and unique. I was happy they had one of the best salsa recipes I've ever had.
Restaurants,2.5,OR,Cross compared Geno's cheese fries with the cheese fries from across the street (won't name names!). I much preferred the fries from across the street. Geno's cheese fries were not tenderly cooked and too soft for my liking. I do not eat meat otherwise I would have also tried the Philly Cheesesteak.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Pretty good.  Not fantastic by Thai Town LA standards but good none the less.  Ribs were great, so was fried rice.  Curry not spicy enough (I'm sure they can up the volume next time).  Room seems chaotically run but everything ended up working. The servers were very nice."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,This has been my absolute favorite lunch spot since I was in high school. Great food  at a reasonable price. Always clean and staff is always very pleasant and attentive.  I've never walked in the door and not immediately been greeted which is definitely rare. Plus the theme is adorable!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Some of the best real Chinese food in Saint Louis. Stay away from the ""American style"" entrees and try the authentic offerings. Beef with Cumin,  Beef Chow Fun, Eggplant with Bean Sauce, Beef Slice and Ox Tripe in Chili Sauce are real standouts. There are some daily specials available as well."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Have been twice since their opening. Definitely one of the best Ramen in Reno (of course there aren't that many Ramen places in Reno). Last time I was glad to see chicken hearts on their yakitori menu but unfortunately they were not on the menu anymore this time.Will be back for sure!
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Got take out here and the only thing I can say is wow. The aroma is different when you open the doors. The atmosphere is relaxing, but the food is good. I ordered the meatballs and it was tasty. I also tried the sausage link and it was also good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Was looking for a place to have a nice home cooked meal to celebrate my birthday. The place is small but well kept and looks like a good business. The food was tasty and everything was great! I had the burger and fries, a salad and a dessert. I really liked the salad"

Restaurants,3.0,CG,"This Smashburger recently opened in the West End, and while they have a lot of great burgers, I really like the one from their menu. It is loaded with freshly ground beef and a side of their custom flavoring. The beef sticks out in the bun, and the flavor and texture is"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Came on a Thursday night. I ordered a 12 oz cheeseburger with a side of fries. The burger came with a side of fries, and the fries were fresh. The burger was spicy and the fries were cold. The fries were served with a side of chips, I didn't"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The food and service was absolutely amazing! I am a vegetarian, and still had a great experience. The workers were so friendly & the food was made very quickly. The restaurant was clean and there were many options. Everyone in the restaurant seemed very satisfied. I will definitely come to back this Firehouse!!!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I usually don't write these things but i was disappointed.  I waited 45 minutes for take out and when i got it home didn't like it.   It was not authentic Mexican at all.  There are better mexican restaurants not far from here at all.  I won't go back.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I like this restaurant before, but since my last visit about a month ago, I decided to not go back. The food amount was reduced and the price went up. The taste of Kongpao chicken we ordered was disappointing. I discovered Chinese Express on Carmel Drive recently. It is much better and cheaper."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The usual items one would expect on a Chinese menu.  Food was decent but not exceptional.  What IS exceptional is that they DELIVER.   
Chinese delivered to your door is common in many cities but something I have yet to have the pleasure of experiencing.  Now, one day soon......"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Have been here four times this week. From Corey at the front to the skilled mixologists this venue is a fabulous retreat. Some of the best Manhattans and Sazeracs I have had the pleasure to enjoy.  Just note capacity is very limited so there will often be a wait.....but clearly worth it.
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"Just left this location, was very pleasantly surprised with how clean it is and friendly the staff were. The food was good for the price and the service was good too.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is a breakfast/brunch favorite. The food is good and the staff is amazing. The place is clean and well kept. The only thing I really don't like is that they only open at 9am. I don't know why they don't open at 8am. It's a good place to
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place is amazing! We had the chicken and waffles and it was outstanding. I would highly recommend to everyone and the staff is super friendly. The food was fresh, fresh and hot and the people were super friendly. We ordered the chicken waffle and the fried pickles"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We have eaten several times at sea critters and had an excellent experience every time.  The menu options are varied and all we have tried have been well prepared and tasty.  Service is overall good and the atmosphere is very casual.  Great location for a walk to see a beach sunset.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,This is a hidden gem.  Great food and drink and a reasonable price.  Really love this place.  Yanaie is an awesome cook here and makes an awesome gumbo and the po-boys are to die for.  Nathan is an awesome bartender.  Really had a great time here and highly recommend.
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Takeout for Cinco de Mayo from Gallito (at Rooster & the Till location due to COVID-19) and they were delicious. Deal included queso + chips, street corn + 8 tacos = $28. It was a wonderful deal and the tacos were DELISH! Super friendly staff and a terrific treat for Taco Tuesday/Cinco de Mayo."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The service was really well meaning, but awkward. Our table was the worst in the whole restaurant, even though there were many empty tables around us. The silverware was not cleaned properly, and had hair in it as well. The one redeeming quality was that the food was decent, but it was not spectacular."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Breakfast, lunch, or dinner....this place is hands down amazing. Great drink options (highly suggest the frose). Something on the menu for everyone and healthy options too!  Catch some live music there too if you're lucky!  You can enjoy the food inside or outside.  A must go to place in the burg."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Charming atmosphere with lots of free parking and open bar. Went to downtown to get some work done and had a great time. I highly recommend this place. The food is great and I always come back. Great atmosphere, great food and great people."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"2nd time here and still impressed. The food was excellent and the service was great. I had the fried oyster and it was delicious. My husband had the chicken fried steak, the beef was very good and the salad was a great addition. The wine list was very nice and I could have easily"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Food was so formulaic and not very imaginative. The only thing I could find to like was the ""Philly cheesesteaks"", but the other food was so boring and standard. They were also over priced. I was very disappointed in this restaurant. I would not return. END END END END END"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,The food was good the service was good. The atmosphere wasn't as good as expected. I went to the food bank because I live next to a school. The place was empty. They had customers in the back. I did not mind waiting. My overall experience with the food bank was not good
Restaurants,4.0,CG,My fave java spot in the city. I love the mac and cheese. The bar food is pretty good too. I love their fresh baked croissants too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's a little pricey. But I actually get a lot of people come in
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Great place to take a date. Everything people say about the mojitos is true. They're great. I got the sugarcane tuna. It was delicious. I didn't realize it was like sashimi but it was great. The mashed potatoes that came with it were amazing as well. Order the plantains if you have a sweet tooth.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,The atmosphere is awesome and the service was above and beyond. It is definitely a cute little place that has authentic French cuisine. I have only been once but will go back to try other things. We took our kids during off peak hours which was a good idea because it is a little fancy.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Food was inedible. Chicken was gray and undercooked. I felt sick after just one bite. Threw away a $30 lunch after we cut the burrito in half. The counter girl didn't seem to care nor make any effort to rectify. The WORST Mexican spot I've been to in Tampa. Highly recommend saving your money.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Hands down best steakhouse experience I've ever been to. You don't have to raise a hand for anything. All the waiters are very tentative and making sure by all means possible you have an enjoyable night. So much, so good, can't even explain...Be prepared to eat more then you think you can. And then more."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Never coming back here for happy hour. The specialty cocktail and wines were completely watered down. The food was lousy with the fries and wings I ordered being completely undercooked. Unfortunately there not too many bar/restaurants with outdoor seating options in philly now, but i sure as heck wouldn't waste my money at this place."
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"Had the chalupa special. A great chalupa. $3. Everything was great, except the chalupa, which was too sweet."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Used to really like This place. It is a little pricey but the food is still excellent. The prices are reasonable but I think it's a good deal. It is located in a great location. Any time you are in the area this is a good stop. END OF LINE END OF LINE END OF
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Stopped in here to grab a quick lunch. I ordered the chicken salad and fries and thought it was delicious! It was well seasoned, with a crunchy exterior. I liked it a lot. I also like that it was so fresh and that it was a little bit spicy. It was pretty good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Great food in the French Quarter. The service was great. The food was excellent. I had the beef bourgogne, which was delicious. The service was good. The dessert is amazing. 

My friend had the shrimp and grits, which was huge and had the best shrimp and"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"REALLY intense menu: ""inviting the chef to demo their creations"" at 1pm. They offered to work with me to make my own, ""delicious"": ""Well, you're a newbie here, so you're kind of new on the scene and you're going to get the first bite, so I"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Nice place. It is clean and well organized. We tried both hotpot and bbq. The food here is fresh, both the meat and the seafood. The food comes quick. The waiters here are friendly and help up replace the bbq plate whenever it is getting dirty. The special offer for birthday is icing on the cake."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,My favorite spot for tacos!! Moved out here from California and looked for so long for real authentic street tacos. Found some in Antioch and were so happy to find El Grullense in Hendersonville!! There's always a line and always a wait and ALWAYS so worth it. And their green sauce is just the greatest ever.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Awesome joint. Cool vibe fun staff and kitchy decor. Guacamole is second to none. I'm a fish tacos snob from California and these are the best I've found on the Gulf Coast. Honey habenero sauce is KILLER good. Will be craving the chipotle chicken loaded burrito and the carnitas tacos for sure.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Great Food! Great Service! I had the hot&sour, veggie egg rolls and moo goo gai pan! The food was so yummy, I went back. I want to thank the two ladies up front for greeting me with a smile and just making me feel warm and welcomed! 

Thanks Ladies!

They even remembered my name! That's Excellent Service!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The Croque St Bernard. Seriously. Eat this. Absolutely delicious. Cafe Aquarius is bringing the parish great food and dessert, and I couldn't ask for more. It's the type of restaurant we don't have and desperately need. Making it a goal to try everything on the menu. But if I had to recommend just one item."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"O'Bistro carries gluten free products, and is a member of the Blue Star Alliance. We have not had any negative experiences with the restaurant or its staff. The restaurant is clean, the staff is attentive and the food is delicious! We highly recommend O'Bistro! END OF UPDATE: My wife and I were"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,This the best Jamaican food on the island. My family loved the jerk chicken. The ribs and the pork ribs were great. My husband loved the fried chicken. The only thing I could find that I'm not a fan of are the biscuits. The biscuits are not big enough for the food and what is served
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Ice creams here are great. I've never had a bad experience, and my only complaint is that they don't have a  cold beer option. They have a large selection of  beers, but I don't think they have a good  cold beer selection. I was able to find a nice  dark"
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"Sad and overpriced scrawny chicken. 

It was a hit or miss experience.  

I think the best part was the waitstaff.  

The place was clean, I was surprised by how clean it was and the decor.  

I have never been disappointed by the"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"They are polite here. They are happy to help, but if you are going to have a snack or have a card or something on a table, it's a different story. They have a server that is not very friendly. He's usually not very attentive, but he was very nice to me."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We came here for a Saturday evening in the summer and sat outside. The drinks were good and service was excellent. Our server was Scott and he was awesome! The food was very good, but nothing that made us go crazy. To be clear it was very good food and we love the area in St."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"2 napkins!  
Not bad cheesesteaks but they give you two napkins!  And when you go up to ask for more they give you TWO more. To top it off; one ketchup bottle at the counter.  There should be better ways to cut cost. Put an Xpressnap at every table and step your game up."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This is my new favorite spot for Japanese. All you can eat for a flat price, not a buffet I ordered every time we wanted more & that includes dessert which I ordered is unlimited too! The saketini was perfectly mixed and priced! Service was top notch!! I love this place and will return VERY VERY soon."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I came in for a quick breakfast and got the egg white wrap and a small coffee. I loved their selection of coffee flavors. I ended up getting butterscotch crunch which was good. 

They have a good looking section of other items including baked goods. Side note, the staff seemed very friendly. I would definitely come back."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"So i have no idea how the bar service is. I went there because i know the new cook. I got a seafood plate - crab and shrimp and a potato. OMG YUM. $10.00 for a huge plate of food? Yes. please.

I plan to return there in the next few weeks to get more of his cooking!"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Since I refuse to go back to another restaurant, I am grateful for the excellent 5 star reviews and by the way, Amish Brat is the best Brat I've ever had. The waitress there was nice and the food was excellent. Since the last time I ate there the food was the same, I"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Delicious chai lattes! Very comparable to the real thing. Great for breakfast/snack. The ""new"" chicken fried rice was excellent. The duck was a little salty. The place has a great vibe. Good place for small groups. I would eat here again! END END END END END END END END END END"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My favourite pizza in Edmonton; I am lucky enough to love local pizza.

I ordered the “Pizza Mio” and it is out of this world! This is my absolute favorite pizza in Edmonton, hands down. The crust is super light, the pizzas are melt in your mouth and the"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I totally got lost upon my first time. I was a little nervous because I've never been to LA at night and had never been in a place that is not open but this place was awesome. The staff was really nice and the food was great. The atmosphere is a little old and the inside is neat and
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The service here is amazing. We ordered the sea bass and the lobster macaroni and cheese. The lobster macaroni and cheese was the best I have ever had. The lobster was perfectly cooked and the lobster was flavorful and fresh. The steak was also great. We ordered the quail and it was delicious.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Went here on a recommendation...glad we did.  Grabbed a quick lunch of carne asada tacos and quesadillas...very impressed!  Even better was the homemade salsa bar which included some sort of highly addictive ranch/cilantro mixture!  We grabbed several salsas and our food and left to eat out.  Loved the food and we will be back!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Located in the middle of the MSA Annex. It's a peaceful place to set up shop, for folks doing a little shopping to stop for a coffee or bite to eat, with outdoor seating. I didn't know they offered food. My coffee aficionado husband got a coffee here, but recalls that it was just okay and very sour."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Ordered for takeout,  a grilled chicken Cesar salad, so very annoyed that we are paying higher prices for their lack of training.   Charged extra for cornbread that came with the meal; one salad, 5 boxes, two bags.  No napkins, no fork.  Seriously?   Oh and only half of a grilled chicken breast."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The blackened grouper sandwich is a gem, big portion, full of flavor, and with a soft bum.
Lobster corn dog is my first ever such dish. Kudos for such a creative dish, very nicely fried lobster on a stick. 
Grouper cheek is decent, but the Thai chili sauce really stood out.
Not cheap, but well worth it (and the drive)."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I have to admit,  they provide some of the best pizza I have ever had, and I'm from Chicago! They get a line out the door once people get drunk enough,  so plan your visit accordingly. 

The only thing I dislike is their online ordering never worked for me, but still a solid five star place."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We order the Gogi Bowl, a noodle bowl topped with the famous bean salsa. It is served with the best white rice in Central Texas. The fried shrimp and the chilihuis are delicious. The lunch special is a huge bowl of beans and rice with a side of beans and rice."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Green Eggs is tasty and makes me want to order an extra egg. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because there's a website that's more than 8 hours away, so it's not easy to actually locate in a crowded restaurant. Food is tasty and filling."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,For fast food it was a little tricky finding the right place. I went to the one across the street and it looked pretty decent. We ordered up and got in since we were starving. My husband ordered up and got the burger. The burger was kind of dry but the fries were really good.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Top level tacos, Tortas!

The Dream Taco

I have to say that the tacos at this place are the best I've ever had. I love their salsa and my favorite is the guacamole.

They have an amazing happy hour, which is definitely something I recommend.

The food is also very good"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This small family owned market is one of my favorite things in the area. It's so quaint, the food is fresh and delicious and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I have tried a lot of different menu items but my favorite has to be the king crab pot pies. I don't know if there is a reason I"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"When you enter the restaurant you are instantly greeted with a smile. You have a choice indoor or outdoor. The cleanliness is very well. The menu has a wide variety of choices, from seafood to beef and chicken prepared to your liking. I definitely enjoy the food as well as atmosphere. Highly recommend if your looking for Hawaiian Fusion"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place was a disaster from jump street. The owner was great until he start asking patrons if they stole a cup.  Also the two waiters were stepford wives who were only there because they were forced to be there. The food was OK, aside from the mini dump drink of salt the poured into the fish special."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,I love Happy Dragon! The food is cheap and cooked when you order it! Hot & Fresh! Great Customer Service! I love their beef lo mein hot & sour soup is the best! And that just that you get this for 5.55! If you are a regular they already know your order and they are very polite and friendly!
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"It's been a while since I've been here but this is one of the few (2?) AYCE KBBQ restaurants in Edmonton. The prices of the food is a lot more affordable. In terms of food (esp. BBQ items) they have a smaller selection than expected, but everything is fairly fresh. The overall atmosphere,  decor, and service are okay."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,A very nice restaurant.  Contemporary interior in an older building.  Creative preparations very well done compared with traditional fare.  Service was excellent and the chef/owner visits with each table.  Very knowledgeable about wine and made good suggestions.  Wine list is reasonably priced and selections may be purchased for take out at a reduced price.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"A marvelous experience with attention to detail. The food was well prepared, the service was superb and the atmosphere was relaxed. The atmosphere is a little dated but still very pleasant. The food is of a high standard and the service is very fast. I will definitely return. ENDLESS MOVIE."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"great açaí bowls must admit the best is still the meaty tapas and tapa alaça of the region. The service is good. The food is good, but the only thing that is good about it is the staff. They seem to have a quality that makes them stand out."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We normally go on the weekends. I usually get the grilled cheese with a side of coke. It's the best grilled cheese I've ever had. The only problem is that it comes with a ton of frosting. I've tried to cut it down and make it a little healthier. I can't do that.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Have been to Satsuma's several times. I love their breakfast. The eggs are great! They also have lots of different items to choose from and can't wait to try more of their dishes. They have live jazz and my favorite is the durian pancakes. I love the way they serve drinks while they are playing music.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Good homestyle food for a good price. The burgers are great and the fries are good too.

I usually have my burger medium rare or medium and the fries medium. They have a variety of items to choose from. I have never been disappointed by the burger, it is usually one of the best I have had."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Favorite spot from our week in Nashville! Fries were crispy, mac and cheese was on point and tenders were bomb! Tried hot, double hot and shut the cluck up and although they weren't the hottest on our nashville hot chicken search, they were awesome. Don't forget to get tons of comeback sauce too! Def a spot where you leave happy!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Pad Thai noodles had a very strange smell to it and horrible taste . Came an hour before closed and it was rushed and they were ready to go . Sushi is very good but don't get a hot dish if it's late . Play it safe with fried rice or sushi if you come late. Very nice scenery ambiance.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The best fried chicken I have ever eaten in my life. We were in a group of four and got a seat immediately but we got there at 10:45. We all chose different sides to try them and they were all good except the fried okra. It was not hand breaded.. 

Bread pudding is the perfect end to the meal!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Craving grilled cheese sandwiches? This is your place! The food is so good and the tomato soup is to die for. They make it every day and it is something that dreams are made of. I do wish they had more to offer on the menu but I haven't even tried everything. So I don't have much room to talk.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"One of the best places in Nashville! Went for brunch and had a fried egg sandwich and chicken salad. Both were great! Drinks and service were good. Neat atmosphere. I don't eat oysters, but they looked good too. We sat at the bar, and service was fast. Seats were also available on patio too. Wait on table was about average."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Obviously, taste in pizza is like calling a margarita a margarita. It tastes like a margarita, but it is a margarita. The crust is crunchy, crisp and chewy. The sauce is a mound of sweet, sour and spicy ingredients. It is a hit with the kids and the adults"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Best pizza by far in the area. My favorite is their bacon cheeseburger.

If you're looking for good pizza, the other places won't do it for you.

And if you like to eat outside, they have a small patio area.

So, if you're looking for a good place"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Visited again when we are staying in New Jersey. I didn't go to the restaurant, but I've visited here before and was happy with their wine selection. I really enjoyed the sandwiches. They have a great variety of meats, cheeses and vegetables. The salads are also quite tasty. The garlic bread is awesome."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,What can I say. This place is the best place to eat in the area. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed by the food. The service is friendly and fast but the food is simply amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They have a great selection of beer and wine.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"SO MUCH HYPE = TOURIST HONORED!

The food was delicious, and the service was a notch above average. My favorite dish: the Tortillas de leche de manzana. Alsadas were amazing as well. We will definitely be back."
Restaurants,5.0,OR,"Tea lovers, this is your place.  They have a such a wide variety of teas. My girlfriend and I were always looking for vanilla Roobis tea but could never find it anywhere until we came across this place. The two ladies up front are extremely nice and helpful. They will find you whatever tea you are in the mood for."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place is a blast,  they've got hundreds of shots and drinks all up on the chalk boards and a boatload of plasma's to catch all the games.  Everyone who works here are friendly and cool and the food is great too (try the bbq salad, really good).  Sunday's 5 Coors or Millers for $15, can't beat it!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Four words. Earl Grey Vanilla Latte'. The hostess made me this and all I new was  joy. OK, that's a little dramatic, but I do really get into my tea. I asked for their Earl Grey, and if she could put some steamed milk into it. oh, and a shot of vanilla. Life with tea is good."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,When I tell you this is the worst Caribbean food I ever had believe me. I lived all over America and been to St.Thomas St.John DR Aruba Tortola... the worst part about it is the roaches I seen crawling on the bar by the register table. I was sickened. The jerk chicken was dry. Rice and peas bland. Cabbage beyond terrible.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The food and service was not good. I've eaten here plenary of times but the St. Louis location was not up to par. I am not interested in returning again. 

The manager came out and had to handle issues at several tables because of the complains of customers. The food was not good!! I was highly disappointed because I've seen better."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"What a fantastic restaurant! Being a vegetarian, I have to say I was a bit apprehensive at first. But I wanted something with a little bit of beefy taste in it. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was so fresh and tasted just like what the name says. The service was wonderful too. I ordered the burger, a"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place as a local favorite for a couple of years now. I have tried many of the dishes here, but nothing compares to the Parmesan chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly with a light herb flavoring. The appetizer bar is also something different from the average Italian place. They have a lot of items on their menu and"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Great pizza! Went in and had a cabernet brekky, which was delicious. Would definitely go back for some nice Italian food! Also, their pizza is amazing! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Place was really cool, service was great, food was good. The avo was good. The burger was alright. The fries were good. The fries were good. The avocado was good. The dressing was good. The dressing was good. And the fries were good. 

The only thing I could say that was wrong with"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,I was actually thoroughly impressed with the atmosphere and the food! The real deal is if you get the groupon and go. We might have spent $10 that day out of pocket and that was tip. 4 of us ate and got extremely full. We took the free tour and then ate for free pretty much. It was w good day :)
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Horrible service. Aren't they supposed to tell customers if they already included TIPs in our bill? Since Bill came out too high i was asking to see if i can check original receipt, all of sudden waitress reacted so rude??

It takes so long to receive the foods and some of nigiris were so not fresh.

Overall, they need to train the servers properly."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Their soda machine sprayed the orange mixture I selected for Seagrams diet ginger ale all over my shorts and I can't get it out using water and soap. I told the manager and she apologized, but that's not good enough. I have a movie to see in a few minutes and this is embarrassing. I can't even get it off my hands!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Had a fantastic experience at Alivita on Saturday night.  Reminded me that a culinary experience in a restaurant is so dependent on your server/captain.  The food was exceptional and our Captain, Jen, did an amazing job of directing our pallet to the right dish and drinks.  Ask for Jen when you go, you may not have the same experience."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I was extremely disappointed in the food. The server was very rude and told me he had been there for 4 hours and no one has come. We spent the entire time waiting for a manager, who then yelled and shouted at us. We had to have someone come over to ask if he was sure he should have had a manager for 4"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This place is really great. This place is a new place in town and very popular with a lot of people. They have some great spots to sit down and eat. I tried the fried chicken and it was amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone. The food is good and the service is great. I think the service could be better
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"A Panera is a Panera.

There are a few things you can find here when you're hungry:

Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Went here over the weekend, the service was great and the food was very good. The beef is a little over priced for what you get. My wife had the chicken and the service was excellent. They have a great wine list and a good selection of beers. The sole reason I did not give this place a five star review is because the"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Horrible salad!  Wilted and not very good. I wouldn't recommend this place. The guy who sold us the salad was rude and refused to give us a price. He seemed to think that we were going to bring it home with us. We are on vacation and didn't have time to eat.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This was my first time here and I gave it 3 stars because everything was ok.... just ok..... it's wasn't terrible but wasn't great.... everything seemed to take a long time to get, drinks, food, desert. I work in a restaurant so I know that sometimes things take long but everything took long. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,The outdoor patio is really nice. I took my grandma and mother here for a relaxing dinner. We were met with very warm welcomes and our servers (Roberta and Luciana) were the kindest people I have ever met. The food was great and their recommendations were perfect. I would highly recommend their bhatata (potatoes) and kebab plate. Luciana's wine recommendations hit the spot!
Restaurants,4.5,OR,The food was amazingly & if you like wine they have a  selection.  I was with a group of 10 and we ate like Kings & Queens.  I had to take a long long walk to justify the gluttony I just experience.  Then we had enabler (server) Scott who just made it a fantastic time for the whole party.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"On my way to Sunday brunch I was able to find this amazing spot off locust called Bluestone lane. And I must say that the food was exquisite and the service was impeccable. Not too mention, a great coffee stop. Our server Davian was not only friendly, but he was attentive at all times and that's exactly the kind of service We wanted."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,If you're into really salty over cooked wings then this is the place for you! I guess when you're swilling Bud Light by the pitcher with your bros it doesn't matter that every wing sauce they have is salty AF. I'm sure that's the point. So many better places to get quality pub grub and beer in the area to return to BWW.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I actually loved the food and the atmosphere. However, I had a terrible experience with the service and atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and helpful but the service was very disorganized.  The food was really good, but the staff was not. I got the tacos with a order of chips and salsa and it only took about 15 minutes to"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I'm hesitant to write this review since I'm not sure if I have to. I have a good reason. I have not had this dish in so long and I have to say it is just not the best. So I'm giving it a few days to see if it develops into something even better. I'm not sure if I will want
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Breakfast was so good and expensive. The bartender was all smiles and friendly. My wife and I enjoyed our meal. The server was friendly and polite. The prices were reasonable. Our server was very cheerful and made us feel welcome. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Thank you for a great experience.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Two of my buddies and I came down to the bar and I got the steak. It was pretty good, medium well done, and the portion was large. The service was slow but the environment was comfortable. The food was quite good. I'm not a huge fan of the steak, but I still enjoyed it."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Some really good Chinese fusion food but the restaurant is understaffed. The wait staff at the restaurant is horrible. We had to wait in line for a table for 7-8 minutes to get a table. When we finally got our table, there was only one empty table left and the food was frozen. We were given a portion of fried"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Very hit or miss. The last time I was there the server spilled coffee all over my food and he just said sorry walked off and I sat there looking at coffee Drenched avocados. I was hoping I'd get a new one but never happened so I closed up my tab and left. I've been there for dinner and it's pleasant particularly sitting outside.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Very delicious. Huge portions. I recommend going with a group and sharing. We got popcorn chicken, boiled beef, fatty beef, bok choy, dumplings in chili oil, egg rolls, dandan noodles, and too many Tsing Taos to count. Between 5 of us we were able to finish most of it. My only complaint is that the popcorn chicken was super oily."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Great sports bar with some of the best wings and sweet potato fries in the Tampa area. Wish they had fresh cut regular fries. Great selection of Ice cold draft beer. Jen and Jenny are on staff and provide fast, friendly and professional service. Restaurant was much larger than I expected and very clean. Great seating and TV coverage from anywhere in the restaurant."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If I could give this place more stars I would!! The food is amazing!! I had the eggs rancheros with chorizo, it was sooo good! Hubby had the banana fosters French toast, and that too was amazing! Wish I found this place earlier on during this trip, I would've ate here more than once! I'll definitely come back here next time I visit NOLA!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"OH MY this is what happens when good food blends with good service topped off with an amazing atmosphere. I have lived in SB for two years and grew up in Ventura. I have dined in NYC, Beijing, LA, Phoenix etc and this is hands down the best of the best. I would trade my Morton's VIP card for a table."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,We are new to the area and this restaurant has been our go to for a while. Tossed a few of our friends in here for breakfast and they all loved it. We had a couple different eggs Benedict and it was delicious. The owner is very friendly and the employees are very helpful. We have been back multiple times and will be back
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"This place will not win any James Beard award. I've been there twice, and each time I've sat down the service was horrible, the food was cold and the service was absolutely terrible. I do not recommend this place.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We went for the official launch party for the upcoming Boundless, a new breed of beer from The Bruery. The lineup of beers was impressive. We started with a barrel aged Hop City, which was good but it is a little too sweet for my tastes. Our next order was the Barley Wine."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is hands down the best selection of Italian food in the area. The food is really yummy and the service is outstanding. The pasta station is amazing. The tomato sauce is a must try and the meatballs are amazing. The tiramisu is my favorite. If you're looking for a good Italian restaurant in the Houston area, try it"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The waiter tried his best, but we waited a long time for everything. The salad was tasty, but the main course of fish was dry and overcooked.  The pasta dish had a tasty sauce, but was mostly pasta, with not much of the other advertised ingredients.
  The cost is high for the food, maybe because of the location.  You can do better."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I have been using Yelp for years and this is my first negative review. I had to write this. The poke bowl was completely inedible. Frankly, it was quite disgusting. Also our food took so long to come out. We sat down around 5 and was not served until 6:30. I would never recommend this place. If you do go just stick with the pizza."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We ordered chicken pad thai x 2, spring rolls and a side of fried rice for a Friday night dinner. The servings were literally enough for three meals for each of us and the quality was superb. I ordered medium heat and it was the perfect amount of heat. Delivery was quick and contactless and we will definitely be ordering again! Thank you, Thai O'Cha!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,Went in today for a case of beer but told at the register that they couldn't charge the price for a case so I would have to pay the price for four 6-packs which is considerably more.  I was stuck buying at that price because supplies are low due to the Covid-19 virus but this is one place I won't be going to again.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Called to order because it's always nice to have a sit-down order. I waited for a long time, finally told to come over to the counter and she said a server would be with you in a few minutes. As soon as she left I heard someone outside the restaurant. My husband and I walked down the street to walk to our table."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,I love this Pizza Plus pizza place. It's really a hidden gem. We can sit outside on the large patio and just enjoy the view. They have a small but delicious menu. I love their margaritas. They also have a great beer list. They also have a nice patio that is perfect for drinking and eating.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Always good, with consistent sushi. Not the best place for some of the things I want, but definitely great sushi. Most of the servers are also very friendly. They have a nice selection of drinks (cranberry, iced tea, etc.) and they have a good variety of flavors. I'd recommend the kaiseki salad (eggplant, shrimp"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The bread and spread were both good, but they could have done more to improve the taste. The bread was not dry and there was too much too little. The spread was not fresh and tasteless. I would not recommend this place to my friends and I would not recommend it to anyone. END. END END END END END END END END END END"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Not a fan.  Wherever I travel, I love to track down the good diners, the road food so to speak.  I would love to say that Bobo's fits the bill, but I respectfully feel the place is way over-rated.  The food is neither interesting nor well prepared, seating is cramped, and the place is not clean.  Prices are not all that cheap."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Service was so bad we left. We gave them a break the first year having gone there at least ten times. Lack of staff and very disorganized. Today they seem to have plenty of floor stay but not organized. Asked to sit in waiting area. Watched three other couples get seated by the same hostess as they came in the door.  Ridiculous and won't return.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Way over rated. Service is awesome but they never asked ma how my meal was. I ordered the big stuff shrimp and it came with four very small shrimp and crab meat had way too much cream cheese in it. I would never order again. I was very disappointed because the place seem like it was really going to be good. Plus, drinks are very expensive"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Nailed it! From the baristas to the beans. Friendly, helpful staff which helped me dial exactly what I was looking for. I was in a bit of a rush, but the barista assured me that the Colombian on drip wouldn't disappoint me. After a couple of a samples, I was on my way with one of the most dynamic drip coffee's I can remember."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This review is only for the short text version. The picture is a bit deceiving. I will give this place a brief explanation. They have the best fries in town! They are the best fries on the North Coast! They are quick, crispy, and so healthy. The food is also super hot! I will definitely be back to try their other foods"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I originally started at The Good Life for a night of research for a story about New York’s next wave of upscale restaurants. I’m glad I did because I’ve been coming here for many years. One of my favorite meals is the Chicken and Waffle sandwich, which is a great way to start the day."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Love this place!! Gone here twice now. Definitely my favorite. The service is always very fast, the food is always fresh and hot. I never have an issue with the food. The only thing I dislike is that they only have a limited amount of food on the menu. I'm always there for a quick bite and always get a great deal."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,Service is slow and bartenders are unprofessional. I was seated and then the bartender called us over to the bar. They did not get our food and stole our money. No one came to our table and helped. Very disappointed. ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS ENDLESS
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I love their pizza.   Something about it just makes me want more and more.  It's different than ""normal"" pizza with the sauce on top of the cheese but I think it's delicious.  It's cash only which is a pain but they do have an atm.  More of a pain for delivery.  Wings are also an underrated item here but are pricey."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Went to this place and ordered

When the order was received the meat was raw.  Took it back to the window and explained the situation.  The person that was probably the manager simply turned and walked away

The manager should have handled this and left the sales employee hung out to dry.  The manager should have also delivered the replacement product out to me

Bad management displayed"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I brought my kids so excited after looking at all the pictures and reading all the wonderful reviews. To our surprise they don't have: crepe, waffle, chamango, the o my flavor over cream they have is vanilla....... to make the long story short, they do t have anything. Well, almost anything. I'm so, SO disappointed. Won't be wasting my time coming all the way here to this."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The employees here are very nice and accommodating and the food is very good and fresh!  The eggplant and tofu clay pot dinner is wonderful!  The eggplant is tempura fried and served with a delicious ginger sauce!  The fried rice is very good as well, and the miso soup is among the best I've had!  Not watery like a lot of miso soups."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Still a fantastic place to go. It is small, but very nice, the food is always delicious and the service is great. We go here because of the free breakfast menu. The only bad thing I have ever had is the donuts, they are just awful and I have never been a fan of donuts."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Friendly, watermelon lemonade was DELISH!, and a great way to end a day of hiking and exploring. We went to their birthday party, and my husband and I had a taste of their delicious treats, and I have to say, it was the best I've ever had. The only difference between this and a traditional lemonade is they serve guests with straws instead of straw"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've been searching for this type of product for a long time. I am so glad I found it. This is a real deal. I ordered on 11/2/16, had it delivered and received it on 11/5/16. Thank you so much! I will tell my friends and family about your products. Thank you so much again."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"The food is fabulous!!! I've been to many restaurants and this place is the best!!!!

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is one of the best restaurants for bar food Uptown. It's so delicious. The Streetcar Special is a personal favorite. Spicy grilled chicken breast with pepperjack cheese, mushrooms, peppers and grilled onions (I prefer it without onions) is a winner no matter what. Plus there's different menu items like the alligator quesadilla. Like everyone says the chili cheese fries are a must. Definitely go there."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I've been to Olive and Oak three times and have always enjoyed the food. But when my husband and I went to celebrate our anniversary this week, the AC was blasting (in November!) and the staff kept promising to turn it off, but they never did. So I had to leave mid-meal and get the food to go. A romantic night ruined. Not going back there anytime soon."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Not your normal schlotsky deli. Been there twice and it was gross. Been tO others restraints of this chain and they are sandwich artists compared to this place. Once the cook just piled on the mayo, unfortunately I went through drive through, also the bread seemed old and the meet more processed and fatty salty than fresh. It's like a ghetto version of the chain."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The quesadilla (steak) was all fat and grisly
The refried beans were seasoned but had no flavor - a little salt would of helped 
And the quesadilla came out within in just a few minutes from ordering and it was cold - 
The salsa bar did look good - but honestly way to high priced for what you get and the flavor - i was not impressed at all"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is a good place to have lunch. I have had the chicken dumplings - both the chicken and the pork - and these are delicious. Service was fast and friendly. I also have had the shrimp with pork and it was very good as well. A bit pricey but worth it. ENDLESS GOODIES ENDLESS GOODIES ENDLESS GOODIES ENDLESS GOOD
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I have a hard time justifying the price tag of this thing. It's not bad, it's just too expensive for what it is. The food is okay and the atmosphere is just okay. I think the experience is just too long. Instead of being in the touristy part of town, let's be in the touristy part of town and have a taste of"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,2nd delivery of the Tandoori Chicken Curry Chicken and I absolutely love it. The noodles are very fresh and the deep fried chicken is delicious. I would give it 5 stars if it came with a side of mint. I don't think I can go to the Tandoori Chicken Curry Chicken without having the mint. The decor is awesome and the service is great.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Yakuza House is a tiny, older, and very expensive place. The food is good, but you definitely need to watch your wallet. They charge $10 to $12 for a piece of fish, which can be very expensive. Although it is incredibly tasty, it is really expensive. My friend and I were very satisfied with our meal, but we have been there a"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Just had a cup of coffee dumped on my daughter and me.  They have workers serving food, but they don't take orders.  You have to order at the register and then self serve your own hot coffee and then try to navigate in a crowded, tight space, thus two people colliding and tattoo woman throwing her coffee all over us.   Oh, the food is good."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We have talking about going here for a while....very glad we did! My husband had the Italian sausage sandwich and I had the scallops with artichoke hearts.....excellent! The sauce was obviously made in house, not thick and yuk....very light and flavored well!
My husbands sandwich was very good....yes, the atmosphere may be lacking a bit, but the food and excellent service makes up for it. Oh and the cannoli rocked!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We came to Deluca's last night and we were so impressed! A great location and the service was amazing. I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli and it was the best i've ever had. My boyfriend had the Panzanelle Salad and we both LOVED it! I can tell this is going to be a hot spot downtown! Definitely recommend trying this place out asap, we will be back again soon."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I thought the food was very flavorful.  I had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce, and he had the pork burrito.  We are giving it three stars because the prices are high.  Also, they give you a complimentary appetizer of their choice instead of chips and salsa.  They charge $2.00 for chips and salsa.  The portions were reasonable, except for the beans and rice."
Restaurants,2.0,CG,"I can't believe I felt like this was over the top and meh. I had a great white, chicken and cheese and we got the fries and coleslaw. Both were good. The fried rice was delicious. 

I'm really glad I went there because I really enjoyed their food and the service. I was a little surprised by how much I liked this"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Good food in huge volume. We had a very large dining party of 7 including my boyfriend, so we went with a smaller group. The food was pretty good. The special for the evening was a family style meal with bread, butter, and a side of cheese. Everything was tasty. The bread and cheese were well seasoned, and the butter and cheese were rich and creamy."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Will never return. From start to finish this place is horrible. The manager was rude and the staff was terrible. I'll never eat at this place ever again.

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"They had a happy hour at their bar on Saturdays. I went to the restaurant after work, and my wife ordered a burger and fries. Her burger was good and I got a drink, but it was expensive. It was about $17 for a burger and fries. I went for the drink and it was ok, but not as good as I remembered."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Very friendly server. Feels like a 'something for everyone' restaurant, similar to the chains. Had a pizza and salad lunch - salad was typical iceburg salad mix (not a fan - prefer romaine or mixed greens) - dressing was good/house made. Pizza was decent - good crust, sauce, and size was perfect for lunch. Not in a hurry to rush back but wouldn't throw a hissy if someone suggested :)"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is my new go to place for Tai food. They have all variations from popcorn chicken to boba. Yes, their boba is my favorite!

Definitely when you visit here, get at least an appetizer and something else to fill you up. They have lunch specials such as bento boxes where it's really filling and right price. Don't forget to buy a boba too. Probably gonna visit here again."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Again, pizza is a highly subjective area so I will try to stick to the facts. Big thin oven baked pizza. Some refer to this style as boardwalk pizza, others call it cardboard pizza. For this genre, it is pretty good. Very family friendly. Great place for bringing the kids after a game. Most parents will find something that they will find acceptable."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Solid 3-star experience.  I did not care for the red chili dumplings and not sure why others have raved about them.  To me, they tasted like they came frozen from the grocery store.  My shrimp dish, however, was very good and they definitely were very generous with the shrimp.  I found the staff very friendly and helpful but the decor was worn and lacking in ambiance."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I am so happy that I found this place. I have eaten at this restaurant for the past 3 years and have always been pleased with the food. The service is always outstanding and the food is always exceptional. I have recommended this place to everyone I know who is a vegetarian or vegan. The specials are always good and very filling. The staff is always friendly and very helpful.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! I have been in here twice and have always been extremely satisfied with everything I have ordered. The food is simply delicious, the staff is always friendly, and they are always so attentive to your needs. The service is always great and the food is always fresh.

I have never been disappointed in any of the items I have ordered and I have been in"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"GLOOOOOORIOUSSSSS!!  Only thing not love is the size of the cupcake. It is not a large cupcake. But it is also not small. 

They have a great selection of home cooking food to choose from. 

Their fried chicken is to die for!  They are also very creative with their desserts. 

If you like the food of NY"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I come here only because of the fresh shrimp and jerk chicken. The philly is great and the food is always fresh. The shrimp is nice and tender and the jerk chicken is good, but I always have to be careful of the sauce. I'm a bigger girl and my husband is smaller. This is his favorite dish and we don't get nearly as much shrimp here as"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I've enjoyed every meal I've had at the silverspoon! The quality of food and the service is absolutely wonderful. The chef even came out to greet us and was warm and friendly, really makes you want to go back. Every time that I've been in they have new items on the menu. You can tour the culinary world without leaving PA! I recommend the silverspoon (and their truffle fries) to EVERYONE!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The food at Ghini's is just delicious. Everything for French breakfast imaginable, and more. I highly recommend the eggs provencale, not something you can get anywhere else. Two eggs basted with a sliced hot house tomato, thyme, garlic and herbs de provance. Get the baguette toast and add the great hashbrowns for a mere dollar.
My personal favorite are all the crepes, both sweet and savory. Especially recommend the spinach and swiss."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,This review is based on the food alone.   Not only does the food look unappealing it tastes how it looks.  Look at other people's photos...just ask yourself does that salad or chicken parmesan really look good??   People must be too drunk to notice the food sucks. You can get better German food at Brauhaus Schmitz.  And once again this review is on the food alone.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Always have a great experience at UTown. It's a tiny shop so expect seating to be somewhat sparse especially at busy hours. It has the feel of a hole in the wall shop because they reuse and only have takeout menus, and you pour your own water. The food is not amazing, but compared to Koreana it's much better. Everything comes piping hot and the quantities of food is pretty large."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I have never been a fan of hot dogs, but the Jack in the box was excellent. I particularly liked the cheese roll, which was small and easy to eat. The onion rings were also good. The food was very hot, but the portions were small. I would recommend this place but only if you have to drive to the location. Also, I was disappointed that the bread"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,The burger was so good!!!! The girl who worked at the counter was so friendly and very kind. The staff there was super friendly and knew how to help you. The fries were very fresh and the burger was fantastic. I just love the fact that they have burgers and fries to go with it. So delicious. Just ordered fries and burger as a side and it was just as good.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I eat only gluten free.

I have no idea how any of the ingredients are made, but I am so sick of eating the same food. I just grew up eating everything gluten free. But I'm a big fan of the homemade tortillas. I make my own tortillas and I'm always looking for ways to make them. I've also had gluten free tacos,"

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I loved the vibe of the place and was hoping it would be a great experience. Really nice server. The descriptions on the menu sounded good, food LOOKED delicious, but it unfortunately tasted just slightly better than decent. It wasn't just my meal, my sister, our friend and his wife all had mediocre meals. 

I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again, but it's definitely not at the top of my list."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,I try to eat in or drive thru only at this McDonald. I order always NO SALT on the French fries. But other places never give my order right! This place is clean and food's temperature is hot and fresh. Specially coffee is very fresh!. I have been coming here ever since 9/1/2011 after I moved here to Jamison. I also love their mobile app and always utilize it to save bucks.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Nice Palestinian restaurant clean on the inside very nice menu board on the wall had the Palestinian gyro it was very flavorful but I wish the bread wasn't so rough to chew my jaw was getting sore from chewing the bread the falafels werent anything to brag about but they weren't that bad were you couldn't eat em  other than that I was pleased with the service restaurant cleanliness and food

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'd say it's a great pizza place, but it's really a great everything place! I've had wonderful steaks, subs, strombolis, pizzas, salads, burgers, and sides from here. They have great prices for great food. You can even order online (which is actually very convenient and easy to use!). They're always very friendly, and I've never had a bad meal from here. I highly highly recommend skipping the chain places and ordering from here!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This Place rocks!  I've been back a couple times and I must say that if you're not in the mood for pizza try the eggplant Parmesan appetizer.  First of all it's not an appetizer size, definitely a full dinner portion and some of the best I've had!  If you're on the fence about trying this place, get off the fence and go and have a great simple, inexpensive night out."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"When you put ""beignet"" in the name you should probably be able to make a good begniet. Nope. Definitely not the case here. The beignets were doughy rather than light and the oil was starting to go off. I took one bite and that was it. I don't think this was a one off day for them either. A friend said she had been there six months ago and had the same experience."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The salmon burger was a bit dry for my taste. The ""Marathons"" used to be my favorite restaurants in Philly, but they have fallen off considerably. The last time my bf and I went to this location, the place was completely empty except for us. I think it was 8:00 on a Friday or Saturday, so that was strange.

I prefer Marathon for breakfast/brunch. They get a little lazy with their lunch and dinner."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I live in the neighborhood. I live in a quarter of the time it takes to get a decent quality meal. My family and I go here every week. The food is great. The only thing is that the manager doesn't care about the customer. They always take over 60 minutes for a quick lunch. I always go for the burger, fries, and soup. I would never go anywhere"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Went here for lunch based on the reviews. Was disappointed. It wasn't that great. The food was cold. No bread and no condiments. I even asked for a bottle of water and that was not offered. I got my food cold, there was no bread in the sandwich, the bread was cold and the condiments were all gone. The staff were really friendly, but the place"

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Got the veggie sandwich again, just not all that great. Not the same as being at a restaurant and getting the same sandwich. 

The food here is always good. I enjoy the sugary-sweetened doughnuts and the cinnamon toast. 

I think the only negative is that there is no carryout. 

Overall, I think it's a great restaurant"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I ordered online early thinking it would be better than crowding in the shop and waiting for a to go order. They should put online a notice that ""all online orders are started after in store customers are taken care of first"" because had I just driven to the place and ordered in person, I would have been served 10+ mins sooner. 30 mins later, I'm finally getting my food."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I definitely like this place better than Chipotle. I think it;s pretty expensive but they do give a generous portion. I've been here twice when we visit after a hangover from fiesta. This has been our annual go-to. Their nachos with steak and shredded beef is delicious! i get it in the bowl as well. the shredded beef is a bit salty so you have to balance it out with sour cream or something.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Will NEVER go to this place again! This is the worst costumer service I have ever had. 20 min wait even with the reservation, nobody take orders, keep ask you to wait a sec, and we waiting for 30min for 1/5 of the food after talk to the manager, order are miss placed, bring an alcohol version of beverage to an underage people. Just no service at all, and force to charge 20% tips........"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We have been going here for almost 6 years! It is the best Chinese resturant  in all of Reno and Sparks! Always Always perfect food and excellent service! We go at least three to four times a month.  Best egg drop soup! I always order a veggie sushi roll substitute soy wrap...best tasting! Yummo!  Will continue to keep going...never ever had any issues! They know how to take care of you!

Customer service was unresponsive.

We will definitely be going back. 

Was it worth the $70 a person?

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I've been to this place twice now, and I have to say I have never been disappointed. The sandwiches are always awesome, and their service is always friendly. The food is always well made, and always comes out fast. Everyone is always very nice, and there is never a bad time. They have an amazing brunch, but the only downside is that it's hard to find parking."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Dropped in to take a quick look around and they were so nice. Great customer service and they have been doing this for years.

Pizza was great, the crust was crispy and the toppings were fresh.

I recommend this place!! ENDORSEMENTS:

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"It was just ok, I probably wouldn't go back again. The steak sandwich tasted like they used frozen beef, the cajun pasta lacked any sort of sauce, the jumbalaya was bland, as was the mac and cheese. Apparently it's a dog friendly place because they let dogs inside and up in the booths -- Gross! As soon as we saw this we asked for the check.  I love animals, just not where I'm eating."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,My wife and two friends went there last night.  It was my wife and my first time there. We were both pleased with the meal.  We decided on their signature gnocchi dish's - one with beef ribs and one with sausage. What a delight.  Really pleased with both versions of the gnocchi were so good.  Nice place and plenty of room to move around the restaurant. You will not be disappointed.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Excellent service and food! Our waiter was attentive. Great drink and beer menu. I didn't order anything but there were a lot of great options. 

We ordered the Avocado Hummus to share. It comes with Flatbread Crackers, Corn Relish, Radish, Oranges, and Pumpkin Seeds. Very good and flavorful!

I ordered the Royale With Cheese, which is Prime Beef, Red Onion, House Pickles, Mozzarella, Pepper Jack Cheese, Yellow Cheddar, and Royale Aioli. A little spicy but good!"
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Absolutely the worst food I have ever had. Fries that were just cooked should not be soggy and cold, grilled chicken should not be cold, melted cheese should not look like it was melted about 3 hours ago. Should have listened to the warnings of the patrons that were already in there when we got there. Definitely will not be going back. I feel like I got gas station good but paid Red Lobster price!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I came here for a quick smoke and then I came back to the place for dinner. The atmosphere is very nice. It is a kind of casual and more rustic than a restaurant.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is a great brunch place! So unique. I tried their crawfish Benedict and feelllll in love. I've never had anything like this dish.

They're open 24/7 , service is great and oh did I mention the food is oh so delicious ...... on my last visit, I craved for pancakes  and was very, very satisfied! Couldn't finish my food, but I left extremely full and happy .....one more bit of information, they have they own baked goods!!! Let me just say, the Jewish Apple  cake is to die for!!!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,OK... Sunday football on the patio but apparently depending on who is working there might or might not be service on the patio. I love the place when you can order a beer but when they dont come outside to service the tables ..... 13 minutes and no service- went inside to order- still waiting...... left and at Beefs where I can actually get a beer and watch football. BELMAR SALOON NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR SERVICE!!
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"More good stuff then few little bad things. Lobby and lounge/bar are nice. Bit pricey but decent food and drink options. 

Room was nice. Bed was nice and sturdy. Tested that bad boy out a lot. 

Drain in shower was slow/blocked up last time I showered. Not that big of a deal but annoying. 

Location is great. Was here for a wedding and central location was nice, but my truck would not fit in underground parking."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Food was very good, place was busy, but the service was fantastic. I had the ""soup of the day"" and it was so good that I had to take a picture to post it on Facebook! I didn't get the vegetarian option because I just didn't want to go there anymore, but I had a great time with my family! The food was cooked perfectly and it was fresh and fresh tasting"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"First time we tried Maple Street, and it was great. I've been to a few places in the past and I really enjoy the atmosphere and the people at the bar. The food is the same. Lots of ingredients, but you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into their food. They have a good variety of drinks and a very nice selection of wines. The bartenders are very attentive"
Restaurants,1.5,CG,"I waited over a half hour to be seated. After a small wait, one of our party found a table and sat down. The server was courteous and attentive. The food came quickly, but the food was cold and bland. The server apologized and said that was his fault, but the food wasn't even hot. He then told me the server had to take a break, and the food would"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Not worth the wait. 
Although the food is good, the service is atrocious. 
I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, which I really liked. 
The chicken was not grilled at all, it was raw, you could still see the chicken inside. 
The sandwich came with a very dry and burnt lettuce, tomatoes and onions. 
The salad was ok, but the chicken was pretty tasty"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,Red Robin burgers are simply the best they're not your run-of-the-mill burger either. They are gourmet burgers that will engulf your taste buds from their amazing fresh buns to any burger you can dream of and they're taking smoky bacon it is a dream and their french fries are amazing don't miss out take your family out you'll be definitely making several trips back to the red Robin hands down some of the best burgers in Reno
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Great portion sizes and flavors that are timeless. The menu is large enough that you'll never get to try everything. The Brussels sprouts are delicious and the fish dishes never disappoint. My mom particularly loves the pies and cakes but I could die for the rice pudding. Sometimes it's a little overwhelming to sit in here, but when my appetite is big enough, I love filling up on this delicious food. Plus the wait staff is great!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,Stopped by on Saturday afternoon to try this restaurant. The restaurant is nice and spacious. The music was a bit loud for me but let's get to the burger. I ordered the Louie with two patties. Happy I ordered two and not three as the server suggested. The burger was pretty good but the bun was just okay...too much bread. Order regular fries and the seasoned fries. Both were okay and the seasoned fries were priced higher.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,I loved south bowl- minus the fact it's cash only for quite the establishment. Bothersome that to bowl cash only but the bar you can use cards. Hopefully once the renovations are over (that we inhaled paint from all night) they will accept cards. I'll keep bowling in my hometown much smaller than Philly until then where I can pay using a card. Or go to another bowling alley in Philly even though I'd prefer not to.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"In my book, this is the best place for fried chicken. The owner is a very personable and friendly. The chicken is delicious, and the gravy is incredible. And the fries are just simply delicious. I recommend this place to everyone I know. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars was because the chicken is good, but the gravy is great. You won't be disappointed with this place."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Who can argue with hot fudge for $1. 99? We love it here, especially when it gets colder than usual. The sides are really good as well. I mean, why not? You can't go wrong with anything. The only thing that I would change would be to give them more of a selection in items like brownies, but that's just me."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I thought I had already played the first three songs, but when I got to the fourth one, they stopped playing it. I think they were just tired. Anyways, I heard the seventh song, and I would say that it was good. The performance was not super loud and I think they were just tired or something, but I wouldn't want to play it again. I will say that the second song"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Couch Tomato is the best!

The food is amazing!

The service is wonderful!

They'll give you a free CD of your choice upon request.

A friend of ours used to live in the area and we would always stop in for lunch.

We can't wait to go back.

Bring your family!

Staff is super friendly and the food is always"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The Godzilla roll is AMAZING! I would have never guessed strawberries and honey could go so well in a sushi roll. YUM! I did pick up and when I arrived I was quite surprised at the smell the place had. I was not to fond of the smell, but the sushi was great, definitely will be returning. We also got the Traffic Light Roll, good; King Kong, good; and the thai spring rolls, which were great as well."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Cool old church converted to a restaurant. Small for an old church but just the right size. Brunch was good and had the mega double burger. It was good and a lot to eat. However how do you serve cold fries when it's one of the first orders of the day and there are only four tables?  Cold fries with a burger is like a warm beer on a hot day - no bueno. 

Worth another try."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My mother-in-law, my son and I all enjoy eating a couple dozen raw oysters, shrimp and crab legs on Christmas Eve.  I don't know how it started but now I am in charge of getting all the required items.  The place where this tradition started has since closed.  I was at a loss until I found Heller's Seafood.  They have everything I requested, reasonable price and easy pickup.   A truely great find."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Super YUM! I got the create your own combo- crab legs and crawfish. It looks all pretty when it comes out. My food was really good, but I probably would NOT get the Ugly Sauce next time. Def will try a different sauce. I may even try a different heat level. I got medium this time so I will probably try one step hotter next time. Def a place worth trying out if u are a seafood lover."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"After so many tries, I'm ready to give up. I'm a bit picky and extremely picky, so if you get it right, it sounds great. But I am SO disappointed when I get it. And the place is totally empty. I'm not sure what the problem is. It's not like the phone is busy or anything, the person I talked to had never been here before."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"It took awhile for someone to get here, but the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We were very happy with our experience. Our server was cute and very attentive. The cocktails were very good as well. All of the food was cooked to perfection. The fried catfish was the best we've ever had, and the oysters were perfect. Excellent service, great food, and very kind staff."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Service is great! Portions are very large and the prices are fair. Easy clean up. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the parking is a bit tricky. It's a bit of a hike and even if you can find a spot, it's still a bit of a walk. Otherwise a great place to grab a bite or buy some snacks or appetizers.

The chicken strips were very good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My running buddies and I got here. Pretty good. A lot of the menu options are really good. I had the waffle and it was pretty good. My wife had the turkey and it was pretty good. For all the food options, I think the prices are fair. The only two places I'd recommend are McDonalds and the Military Exchange. ENDLESS. ENDLESS. ENDLESS."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Very good as always. Comments largely in previous review but had small custom pho with eye round, lean brisket, and flank steak. Meats are always outstanding with a very clean, but thin, broth. Noodles are always really good here too. If you like Vietnamese coffee, theirs is better than most too for whatever reason. One of my favorite places in Philly (along with John's Roast Pork) for comfort food, and have been a fan for about 17 18 years."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We had a 6 inch pizza and salad each, also appetizers of olives and mushrooms. Both were swimming in oil. 1 Beer and water. The pizza is really just flatbread. The appetizers were brought with no plates, had to wait several minutes.  Even the salad was oily and small. $46 later and I  left thinking well that was very expensive for what we got  I could eat somewhere else right now. I would not go back."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"The food was decent, service was great at first but then the waitress didn't tend to our table anymore. It took about an hour to get our food and was not that hot. When we were done eating we watch the server take two other tables orders, she did not offer to get us boxes, or fix our check after she said she was going to apply the discount eventually we paid in full after twenty minutes of waiting."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Best Cajun food I've had outside New Orleans!

Gumbo is just right with good flavor and spice.  A lot of people told me to try the trainwreck po boy, and the Muffalatta looked great.

Simple, quick service. Beignets only available select days...Sunday being one of them, but they were all gone by the time we got there at 2pm. Next time we'll have to come for breakfast.  Very curious to see if they're even close to Cafe du Monde."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Excellent experience!  We did not think it would be a big deal, but the experience was fantastic!  The food was very well prepared, and the staff was very friendly. The service was excellent.  We will definitely be back.  The prices are reasonable and the food was excellent.  We will definitely be back again.  One of the best dining experiences we have ever had.  We would recommend this restaurant to"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I love this place! I get the Asian and their buffalo wings. Both are amazing. If you're looking for a quick meal and good service then this is your place. I would definitely recommend this place. They have great food and the service is great. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the food is pretty quick and not worth the wait. The staff is always very friendly and the food is always
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I was sick on a Saturday afternoon about 5 pm and decided to try this place. I would have never tried this place before if my husband wasn't a very hospitable cook. I got the chicken, fries, and soup. I had the soup and it was delicious. The chicken was incredibly juicy and flavorful. I had the fries and it was so easy to eat. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone if you"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Since previously coming in for a haircut my haircut had been booked for three days and I was so excited to finally get my haircut since I had been wanting to do one for so long. The owner was very nice and friendly. She asked if I wanted to wait for my stylist to get here. I said yes and waited for about 15 minutes for my stylist to show up. I was still waiting for about 15 minutes
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Ensenada is truly a hidden gem. It's a small stand with outdoor seating, but certainly worth the trip. The service is great and I love that it's a woman run business. We love the new vegan options offered. They have a vegan pastor taco, vegan vegetable taco, and vegan chilaquiles. The vegan pastor is outstanding! We have yet to try the other two options. I have also recommended Ensenada to my omnivorous friends and they've loved it."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Little old diner in Santa Barbara north of all the shops and stuff on State St. Here for a quick breakfast. 

There is no parking here. Only street parking I saw. Inside is small. About 10 table and a short counter area. The booths are small for 4 people. 

Service was very friendly. Nice job here. 

Food was good. Blueberry pancakes are with fresh blueberries. Everything else was standard; eggs and bacon. 

Price was ok. 

Overall I would come back."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place made the BEST calzone I have ever had. My calzone was packed with cheese and pepperoni. It was everything I ever envisioned a calzine should be. We went during lunch and it was packed. The line was huge, but these people work hard and quickly. I was so impressed with their work ethic and they even had time to be friendly and help me choose what I wanred. If I could give thus place 10 stars I would."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I cannot wait until this place is open for in-person dining again! I received a gift card for Christmas and have been a few times now in the past few weeks and am loving their seasonal menu (Fireside Latte and Ginger Spice Latte are both delicious)! They also have a Tiger Eye Latte (basically a dirty chai) which was very good but couldn't really taste a ton of chai, so if you're wanting that flavor, ask for a little more!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Double Shack Burger, Fries and Waffle. NO CASH. This was the most delicious meal we've ever had! The steak was great, the fries were awesome and the best veggie burger in town! Highly recommend!

Excellent food and service!

We'll be back! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! ENDLESS! END"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Favorite boba place in Tampa. They have a really good Mexican food. Great family atmosphere. Prices are reasonable for the food. The staff is very nice. We have been there twice, and we will be back. We love the salsa!

Food is great. Price is very reasonable and the food is fast. If you're in town, go there! END OF STORY! END OF STORY! END OF STORY! END"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I've had mixed experiences at the craft beer bar but I've had some good ones. I've been coming here since it opened and my dog's favorite bar. I always go to the bar after work and order a beer while they have a live band playing. The beer is very good and the food is also very good. The beer is also a little pricey but it's worth it. The food is also good.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've been here twice (pre-covidio) and I've been impressed with the food. They have very good salads which are the best of the best. The meat and the veggies are very fresh. I've also had the Cajun shrimp and a few other dishes, and I've always had good service. I have never had the prawns but have been told they are good. The food is very good, and they do"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"After reading the previous reviews I was looking forward to trying this place. Sadly, there wasn't one dish that stood out or even was satisfactory.  The BBQ ribs were dried out & tough. Beef lo mein, plain & beef was not tender but chewy. Bourbon chicken -nothing special & chicken was over cooked. Only thing that was ok was the shrimp roll & since I've never had one, can't say whether it was an authentic one, but it was good."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Space was amazing! The Queso appetizer was not queso,  It was this big hot clump of cheese with roasted pumpkin seeds with honey and came with three unsalted pieces of tortilla. My ribs were overcooked and dry. And they don't tell you the ice teas are 4 DOLLARS A PIECE for each ONE YOU drink. OH! And I got yucca tater tot's which tasted like  paste. Our waitress was super sweet and nice but the food was super disappointing."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Excellent eat, and super fun to eat with your hands. The food was delicious and the server was nice. The place was very clean all around including the restrooms. The decor inside was very cool and shabby chic-esque. and the price was very reasonable. For two large plates and a coffee we walked out for $25 bucks which included tip and tax. Definitely should try this place. If youve never had Ethiopian and are skeptical, don't be. It was very good."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I live walking distance from the Reading Terminal and often frequent it. I enjoy the unique small shops that offer quality cheeses, spices and fresh butchered meats. The owners are always friendly and inviting. The challenge with the Reading Terminal is the extremely overcrowded walkways which make it very difficult to maneuver through the market place or enjoy the experience. I highly recommend going to RT before 9am if you want to feel and see all that it has to offer."

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"As a Chicagoan, pizza is an acquired taste; but if you know how to make it good, it is one of the best. When you are a pizza lover like myself, you would not need to know how to make it any other way. The location is perfect for a casual lunch, and I can't imagine what it would be like to eat out in the city without a pizza place in my city."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Eh, it was okay. 

For $10, they got us a bunch of hot dogs and fries.  They didn't have a lot of hot dogs, and the fries were really small. 

The atmosphere is quite cool, and it's a nice place to hang out with friends. 

The only complaint is the hot dogs were a bit dry.

My friend and I both enjoyed our time here"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is an amazing place! The staff is super friendly and the food is so yummy. We go here for a party of 6 and the wait was so worth it! Will definitely be going back! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

The food is so yummy!!! And such a cute place that is open for lunch and dinner. We usually get the ""Fried Chicken"" and it's so good!! I"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Our group had a great time at the Cooking School. The classes are well organized. Our instructor was Michael he made the class fun and very informative on how to prepare Gumbo,Jambalaya,Pralines and Banna Foster.The few people that we had to drag along actually admitted to having fun when the class was over. Next time I am in New Orleans it will be part of the trip to go back for some additional lessons and of course the free beer and food."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Good selection and good prices, though not as good as bigger cities.  The produce looked average and some vegetables were sad looking.  However, was very happy to see a great selection of choy cabbage.  Also bought some live blue crabs.  They were small but turned out to be sweet and very tasty.  Good selection of frozen dumplings, drinks like soy milk and Japanese sodas, and a lot of snacks. Great selection of noodles and Indian food too."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Pretty good Ox-Tail. I gave this place a 4 even though I've been here multiple times because I feel for the price of the Oxtail you should get a larger Portion of what you get. Staff is friendly,  place is very clean and they have tv's for entertainment. They also have good Jamaican punch. If they can just have their food a little more hot as in temperature that would be game changer for this spot along with prices for Ox-Tail."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went got Taco Tuesday. Tacos were only _1.00, but they were nasty. Just beef, no seasoning & hard or soft shell. Not worth even a buck, not even warm

The Margarita special came from a. bucket & tasted like nothing special or any alcohol?
Loved the establishment in Carrolwood, but this one, not do much. I really miss Taco Tuesday, since I moved to Pasco. But, this certainly isn't the answer

What's a girl to do? Keep trying & looking for that great Taco place?"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,This is a really nice apartment. The location is great as well. Very close to the river and the subway. The hostess was very helpful and helped us with our reservation. I have to say I have never seen a hostess so kind before. We had a nice dinner there and there is a nice little bar in the back as well. It's a great place. The food is pretty good and the service was great.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"First time trying their Fish Tacos!

I have a history with this place. The first time I had their fish taco was a few years ago. It was not the best, but the fish was good.

More recently I have tried their tacos. Their fish tacos are the best I have ever had. The fish is fresh and flavorful.

I also love their queso. It is a nice pairing with"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,My wife and I had a wonderful time at the restaurant. The food is amazing and the service was great. I would definitely recommend to everyone. It's a little pricey at $45 per person but it's worth it. The service was fast and the food was very tasty. We had the chicken strips and the soup it was very good as well. I would say if you want to try something new and if you want to try something
Restaurants,4.0,OR,I liked this place as I can sit outside and watch the people as i ate. Plus I saw some of the great breakfast foods other were eating as i walked by. The servers there in the morning shift on Feb 11th were great and cheerful!! One even gave me a piece of the alligator sausage to try. They had the best Eggs Benedict i have ever had. I think it had something to do with the cheese biscuit vs the normal bread....
Restaurants,4.0,OR,We are new to the area and Tosco's was recommended. I owe those people a meal at Tosco. The place is a neighborhood Italian restaurant. It is not fancy just good. The pizza was best I have had anywhere for a long time. We saw some great platters being delivered to other tables and we are going back to try them out. The salads looked very good and they are huge. The service was very friendly and welcoming. We just felt at home.
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The establishment is very nice and the food was on point, especially the pizza. The service was one of my worst experiences.  After being seated, it took over an hour to get our first drink and about the same for the second. When our fabulous pizza arrived it took them 20 minutes to hand us plates for the pizza. The server was really young and looked flustered. The manger should have been assisting instead of mingling around the bar with the locals."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I give up finding a good place to eat when I stop in here. On the 1st time I went there I chose a fish taco. I got an appetizer which was the green chile taco. The fish was fresh and hot, the green chile was ok, I would not eat again. I ordered the tacos and they were ok. The sauces were good but not great. They do have an Argentinian salad."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I wasn't sure what to expect but it was excellent. The food was fresh and hot and everything we ordered was delicious. We had a large portion of food, they kept it cold and served it straight out of the oven. My husband and I ordered the shrimp cocktail and had the jumbo shrimp cocktail and we both loved it. The best part is that it's not a fancy restaurant but more of a diner like restaurant."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Easily my favorite Mexican restaurant in the world. The food is always great, the service is always great and the atmosphere is just awesome. I would never go anywhere else. I have been to their restaurant 3 times now, and have yet to be disappointed. I recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a great meal with a great atmosphere.

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We loved this cute little place. The staff is extremely friendly and very accommodating. The food is amazing and they have a very large selection of beer. We ordered the clam chowder which was delicious. Try the Margarita blanco and the margarita azteca. The flavors are amazing!

The cost was a little high for what you get, but we were happy with the food."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Their catering truck services the neighborhood I recently moved into and I decided I'd give it a try. Disappointing is what came to mind. Price seemed high for a food truck but I know a lot of chef's are trying this model so I went ahead and got the lobster bisque, thinking it would make a nice, light dinner. Mediocre at best. Guys in the truck were nice and the order came up quick, but as to quality... I think I'll pass next time."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Been here a few times and was ok... Last time i went there was the last for me. Not only because of the service but also the quality. After waiting a long 35 minutes for a butter bagel, I was faced with a man screaming my last 4 digits of my phone number while banging my change on the table. After this terrible treatment I bit into what seemed like a raw chewy bagel and threw the whole thing out. So obviously don't recommend..."

The biscuits vat Maple Street  Biscuit Company are scrumptious...

To top it off, since it was our first time here, we received a cinnamon biscuit to share. What a great start of the day!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This is a place for EVERYONE. It's not just a sports bar, but also a wine bar, or outdoorsy- beachy place, or play place for kids and families, or a place to hear good music, or a place to conduct business, .... to have parties,... to have meetings,... to be on a date,... have a girl's/dude's night out,...etc. I think you get the picture. Eddie's is THE place to go for just about any occasion. Oh, did I mention that the food is amazing?"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Highly recommend this spot for a family outing. All the food was delicious! Our server was very knowledgeable and gave great tips on what to order. The service was pretty good as well, though it wasn't super busy. The blueberry pancakes were my favorite and my husband ordered the chocolate cake (which was delicious). The ambiance was also great. If you're looking for a quick, cheap lunch, this is a great option."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Pizza places are a dime a dozen, but there are some great places to eat out of town. For that reason, it's important to follow your wallet.

One of the best is Pizza Hut. This is located on North Marine Way in North Myrtle Beach. It's located in a local business park, and is located right at the beach. The owners have a great reputation, and they have a good variety of pizza.

My only complaints is the food at times can get really greasy, however some people may like that, but I feel gross afterwards, so I don't eat here often. 

Its a solid choice for Mexican food, It's a good place for groups.

The online ordering system is really convenient and easy to use. I will be eating here several times per month."

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Managed to snag a last minute reservation on my recent trip to NOLA.  One word ""amazing"".  Such a great variety of choices so ask your server their recommendations.  We had the family style chicken, crab topped hummus, and  3 delicious small side dishes- eggplant, red pepper, and feta cheese with leeks....all were flavor filled, mouthwatering and perfect for our party of 4 good eaters.  They also kept the fresh pita coming.  Would definitely come back the next time in NOLA."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This place is excellent. It's not your normal night out for dinner. 
This place delivers a dining experience!
We went with the 4 course meal. It was fantastic and very filling once dinner was over.
We ended up spending 2 hours there dining with fine food , wine and good conversation with my wife. 
The service is some of the best I have ever experienced. 
If you want to go out and do something different. Mix it up a little. And treat yourself to an amazing dining experience."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"One of my new favorite places! This place was my sister's new favorite place. They do a lot of things to make their food and drinks even better. I can't say enough good things about their bar. The beer selection is really really good. The food is really really good. The service is really really good. This is one of my favorite new places around. I always order their wings and fries and go crazy with their shakes!

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This place was by far my favorite meal out of my stay in Baja this trip. I had the Lobster Roll, the chicken fish tacos, and the entree of the day. I also really loved the bread basket and the chocolate pies. The service was also very fast. The only disappointment was the not being able to get anyone to help us when we were trying to order. I will be back again and again."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I'm a novice when it comes to the food scene in Philly and the cuisine here is not great. I got the prime rib and a plate of cheesesteak. I ordered the cheese steak and it was not the best I've ever had in my life. Also, the cheese steak was done on a wood smoker and was not even grilled. I also ordered a side salad which came out of the refrigerator with a small wedge of iceberg lettuce."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Full disclosure, this is the location in the nashville airport, so it's understood that the meats are smoked at the main location and delivered. The pork is decent, but you can tell it's not fresh out of the smoker. I prefer whitts bbq when in the Nashville airport. Btw, this is a bbq place so unlike many of the poor reviews seen about the breakfast here, I wouldn't even try breakfast here and would say caveat emptor to those expecting a great breakfast from a bbq joint."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The women in the front had terrible attitude and were questionable hostesses, but Vanity was the best server! She made awesome recommendations and was super helpful to us! 

We ordered a platter of mixed seafood items with corn, potatoes and sausages (which is about $90). We also ordered sides of fish & chips, crab cakes, crawfish fried rice and fried frog legs. We paid about $200 for 9 of us! 

Thank you for offering to take a group photo of us and being super sweet to us!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"We did the Dinner Cruise last night.   The entertainment was great and the meal was good.   On the downside the waiter was rude.  He yelled in my ear several times when addressing the table, no one at the table could understand what he was staying because of his accent, he kept reaching across the table to refill water glasses, he never brought additional dinner rolls and he took forever to bring coffee for the other guest. We were seated at table 26"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,Came here with my friend in January for our 25th anniversary and was not disappointed. The decor was very nice and the service was very attentive. We had a couple of salads and a large portion of chicken nuggets. We also had the fried oyster and the crab cakes. The oysters were out of this world and the crab cakes were delicious. The fried oyster was cooked perfectly and the crab cakes were very crispy. We also had a couple of drinks
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Great ingredients, great taste and service. I've never had their apple pie but it was delicious and so filling. My personal favorite is the apple pie and the tomato pie. Another favorite is the fried chicken. I'm still a loyal customer but I'm not that fan of the tortilla chips. They're good but not my favorite. The only complaint I have about the food is that the quality of the food is not up to par."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Grew up on Philly cheesesteaks and had a hard time with their new style of meat. The ingredients were excellent, but the technique of mixing the meat was a bit of a pain. I personally would prefer a more simple sandwich. I would suggest ordering the Big Greshme. I'm sure it will only take you a couple of minutes to make, but it's a great experience. The flavors are top notch. The sandwich is generous with the meat."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love this place because of the food more than anything. The service of staff aren't the most friendly... at least the last 5x I've been they were less than friendly... make me feel like a bother when I'm there no matter what time. 
but we walked in while others were being served the other night and they told us it's closed even though it says 1am and they were bringing people food and serving drinks.....
Kind of annoyed since I'm there frequently. 
Anyways try their garlic cheese fries"
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"The restaurant should improve the quality of the food a lot if they have ever wanted to boost the business. All of the food options were not good nor fresh, especially the sushi and the seafood. The choices were pretty poor, even though there were more than 50 courses, but I could not find any of them delicious or tasty.  With the price paid for the buffet, it was understandable. But I would rather pay few dollars more per person to get a much better China Buffet."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,I very rarely write reviews but this place deserves one! Let's start with the service our server Camilla I believe was her name was fantastic.  The first time in a long time that the service and the food were great! She was very attentive and knowledgeable. She gave great recommendations including the tower appetizer which was amazing and had a little bit of everything for us to try! I 100% will be back and be telling my friends if they have not been yet they must go!!
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Atmosphere and ambiance of opal casino is great. Casino is well located. Casino has plenty of room but not too much. We were able to use the pool and had a great time. Love the tables and chairs. It is a little pricey but I believe it is worth it. Great service and food choices. Good place to relax and relax your mind. This is a great place to come and unwind after a day of work.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This place was awesome! I had the chicken salad and my husband had the chicken fajita. The chicken was fresh and tender, the fajita was tasty and healthy. The burrito was delicious and I would recommend it to friends. They even have a salad bar for you to choose from, but I would recommend the chicken salad. I was out of my usual baguette, so I didn't want to add it to the sandwich."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This place was recommended by my friend, who said it was very good. I decided to try it and was very pleasantly surprised. We got a table and it was roomy, seating for 8. Service was prompt and friendly. I have to say that the ceviche was the best I have ever had in the city. I will definitely be going back. END. END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I am so sorry, my last review for this was a mistake.
I went here for breakfast on an SB trip. It was an adorable little shop with some delicious menu items. Its a great place to take a few people and share a bunch of stuff because it all sounds good. 
Beware - its kinds tricky to find, but don't give up. 
I wish there was a bit more space to eat.
And, one more thing, they do special chef dinners that sound awesome. I hope to try one soon!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Lyndel and the management at this place are KILLING IT! We were in town for a funeral and they single-handedly lifted our spirits each time we dined there (twice). 

They have fun, don't take each other too seriosuly and obviously get along well. Each employee we interacted with had their stuff together and displayed a great sense of ownership. 

This crew made us feel like we were in their home --- not a diner on the bottom level of a hotel. 

Keep it up! We'll be back for sure."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant in the U.S that I would term ""authentic"" until going to Lola's.  Quite simply the best tacos and sopes I've had in the U.S. (and as good as any I've had in Mexico).  It is a simple menu, not dissimilar to a taco stand in Mexico, with limited choices but that which they serve is done exceptionally well.  Even the agua de jamaica (basically hibiscus flower tea with sugar) was a fresh and delicious compliment to the tacos."
Restaurants,3.5,CG,I was out with my mother and I noticed a group of people being interviewed on the TV. I was wondering if I should go out and ask them to change their names. I didn’t want to go on TV and get fined or get arrested because it was my mom and I and not them but I wanted to know if I could ask them if they wanted to change their names. I was told no but one woman told me to just tell them that she had
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've been here before once when I was a kid and I really enjoyed it. It was just a little too crowded but I guess it's because of the new location. I'm sure it will be better in the future.

The food is okay but I'm not sure it'll be a huge hit. The kids have to have their own plates when they come to eat and the adults have to do the same. It's a nice spot but they don't have"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I really enjoy eating at this place. It's right across the street from the street, but I don't think it's that busy. You can always find a table inside, and they have a great selection of beer and wine. I also enjoy their burgers and fries, and they are pretty darn good! Their burgers are a bit on the pricey side, but I can't complain about the fries. I do like their fries though. The prices are pretty decent, and"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,It was absolutely amazing. Honestly it may have been actually TOO much food for the price. Went here on a Nashville Saturday for a Bachelor Party weekend. It was the one BBQ place we wanted to go to. Ended up just being half the party go. I got the BBQ Machos & they were absolutely amazing. Ate the whole thing & was stuffed. So that is the one concern of going here if you want to party in Broadway afterward. It will be taking time to digest all the food.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"First chance I've had to eat at Roots since they moved to their new space. First off - the feeling when you walk in is fresh and charming. They've done a beautiful job with decorating and the space is very inviting.  Ordered the ATL - a new fav of mine.... fried tomato, avacado and lettuce sandwich on multigrain bread. I literally could eat that EVERY day it was so amazing, fresh and full of flavor. I love the way this restaurant views food and cooks and definitely recommend them."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"This is the first time I bought lunch from Cafe Walnut, but I've not got a new go-to when I need a healthy satisfying meal! I got the Bibimbap w/ Bulgogi + Vegetable Dumplings + Honey Ginger Tea for $9.99. Normally I hate spending $10 on lunch, but this is SO worth it. Fresh, healthy, delicious, made-to-order, and FILLING!! The staff is always very nice and offer great customer service. Plus - they have great latte prices ($3.50 for a large!); will definitely be back to try all the flavors!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"There is not a bad thing about this place. The staff is awesome and always has a smile, even when she gets irritated. She's so nice and fun and always there when you want to talk to her. The food is always great, and there's always a delicious salad to enjoy, always! I've tried various types of food, like the wings, the pizza, the hot dog, and the chicken and cheese. The chicken and cheese is my favorite, but they"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I'm so glad we decided to take this trip this time around. This restaurant has the best service and the food is so good. I love the vibe, the decor and the people. It's not a big place, but for a small party it's perfect. I'll definitely be going back. My only critique would be the wine list is a little small. It's big on the wine list, but not as big as you would think. The wine is a little pricey"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Top notch store, the absolute best in town. This is NOT a place to go if you're looking for a craft beer. This is a place to go if you're looking for a fairly standard beer. They have a wide variety of beer, but they also have some very good beers that are a bit more traditional. They have a large amount of food available as well. The menu features a wide variety of food. I've never been disappointed by the food and I've been"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Wow, I really like this place. The food was pretty delicious; and I think the price is fair if you're parking your butt at the cafe to do work. There was a lot of boardgames to choose from as well, I believe it's five dollars per person for a game, with unlimited time. It's pretty nice if you're really into games but do not want to spend a lot of money for one time play games like the Unlock! Series. Service was super attentive and kind as well."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,First time here. Really is a small hole in the wall. But it was a treasure to find. The service was amazing. The staff greets you kindly the moment you walk in and they seemed to know quite a few customers by name!!! The only negative I would say is that the place is very small so you may not be able to sit down and it is pretty hot in here the AC was definitely not able to cool down the space properly. All in all great food & service.
Restaurants,4.5,OR,The corn appetizer is amazing. Everything we ordered was extremely flavorful and delicious. For 2 of us we ordered 2 apps and 2 arepas and we left absolutely stuffed and with leftovers. The arepas did take a bit longer than everything else but the server was quick to inform us of that - and they were 100% worth the wait. You probably want to make a reservation for parties of 4+ because we got there at 6 and there was a line out of the door. Will definitely be going again!
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"My wife & I took the tour on Wednesday night. The words ""fun and informative"" are to be expected. The tour was all about the history of the area and how to enjoy the many attractions in the area. The guide was wonderful & was very informative. We loved everything. The history and history of the area is a must for everyone. We will be going back to the area soon. As for the food, the food was great. The deserts were to die for."

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We loved this spot! What a perfect spot for a meetup. We had a wonderful time and it was a perfect base for the experience. We had a few drinks, some lunch and a few snacks. We had a few different appetizers and the salads were excellent. We also had a few unique cocktails and it was delicious. We highly recommend this place. We will definitely return. I had the salmon, it was absolutely delicious, very fresh and flavorful."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I've eaten here once before and it wasn't very good. That being said, I wanted some cheap food for a party coming up and there was a groupon - $12 for 50 pieces of chicken. We called to order the chicken and were told there was no Groupon running. This place is ran as poorly as their food. Also, considering their past history includes people getting murdered in the parking lot and a manager refusing the play Saints games because he disagrees with the players' protests, I am done with this place."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I'm SO glad we decided to check this place out because the food was every bit as good as we could have expected. We ordered a variety of things and it was all REALLY delicous. I love their handmade tortillas. This place was ALMOST as great as a restaurant in Guanajuato Mexico called Truco 7 which is where I had THE BEST Mexican food  ever! For me this place was an unexpected delight!  We did have to wait in line for 20 minutes, but it was well worth the wait."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Beers buy the glass are expensive. Decent selection of about 24 on tap. The food is average bar food with the burger being about the best value. I ordered the Cali Club Sandwich and though tasty  with butter and pork belly and salt , not a healthy choice ,also noted the turkey on the sandwich is your standard cold cut turkey.Great place at happy hour if your not eating in, or have little regard for what you do eat and put in your body. Bring the kids and feed them fries."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Out of a table of 20 serviceless employees, eight of whom were in the yard and another four in the kitchen. The kitchen staff and the waiters were not excited. What was not a happy experience was the well-meaning but neglectful front desk person. I called the front desk at the door, only to be told that no service was available. The front desk person came in and informed me that the front desk had fixed the problem."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Honey Walnut Shrimp with Combination of Shrimp and Vegetables.

I ordered the shrimp with a variety of vegetables. They were all delicious, but I did find the shrimp a bit bland.

The meal came with a side of white rice and broccoli. The broccoli was hot and had a good flavor.

The fried rice was also good. It had some flavour to it, but it was not very fresh.

The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,It gets pretty busy so get there early so you can snag a seat. It's a nice place for lunch or a quick refreshing drink. The service was good and the employees were very friendly and helpful. The food was pretty good and the drinks were also quite good. I liked the chicken and waffles but it was also a bit spicy. The chicken was nicely seasoned and the waffles were good but they were a bit too spicy. The service was good but the wait was rather long
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Aside from appetizers I have yet to eat here, I would not recommend the Nachos but everything else is alright.  

In terms of being a bar The Green Parrot is a place to grab a drink or two but not a meat market.  Depending on the Bartender you it is possible to get a stiff Jack and Water.  There is a decent crowd on weekends and The Bartender's are usually quick to serve.  It's nice to go in the summer when the doors in the bar area are open."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The edamame ravioli's were great.  The atmosphere was so unique and I also loved the music they play. The service was outstanding.  Only reason why I gave it a four was because the dishes were way too salty.  They can definitely cut down on the salt, since more can always be added more into it.  Otherwise, I'd definitely go back.   It was a beautiful place.  They are also very accommodating.  My date planned everything ahead of time with them and it was really really nice."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"As far as hotel experiences go, and this is a great one. We came here for breakfast. They had great music. The whole building was the old courthouse so the marble is amazing. The breakfast was good the servers were excellent Michelle greeted us and seated us and made us excellent coffee and Melissa served us a wonderful and very fast service with a friendly, warm attitude..  not a lot of vegan/vegetarian options, no steel cut oats. But it decent espresso for a hotel. The service is what made it even better."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've read and heard about this place for the past few months and I am so glad I finally got to visit. The food was so good, the service was great and the atmosphere was so elegant. I'm so glad that I finally found a place to enjoy my meal while I took advantage of their free WiFi. It's a little pricey, but I guess that is because the food is so good and the service is so great. You can't go wrong with this place, but if you"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Everytime I give it ""one star"" is a good thing. The food was good and the service was slow. Food was served on time. The only reason I gave them a ""one star"" is because I think they overcharged us. I ordered a carne asada sandwich with cilantro and shrimp. I got the sandwich on a platter and it came with lettuce and tomatoes. The sandwich came with lettuce and tomatoes."

I've been there a bunch of times over the last few years and have never been disappointed.  I just wish it had more of a history.  I like that there's a large seating area, but I'm not sure I've ever been there when there's just a small section of seats"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I love this place.   It is the best place around to get Chinese.   We drive all the way from Carson City to go here.   So far we have tasted many dishes from this restaurant and have yet to be disappointed.  My personal favourite is the house pan fried noodles.     They do an excellent job with blending the sauce and the noodles so that they are soft yet crunchy.   Speaking of crunchy, do yourself a favour and order the spicy crispy beef."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"I love tropical smoothie. I ALWAYS get the island green smoothie and the chicken bacon ranch flatbread. Both of which are awesome. 

I told myself that I would start to try something else on the menu as far as smoothies are concerned but when it comes time to order I always fail to do so lol ‍ ONE DAY!

Anywho, this location is fairly new and I have had pleasant experiences so far. Staff is nice, establishment is clean and the location is great.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Beers were all canned and the few that we chose were overpriced. Seems that they charge more than they should so that when they do their extended happy hour specials they are not blowing profit. Service was extremely slow on a Thursday night. The brisket was great, the sauces were so-so, and the sides bland. Wish I could have had a larger portion of meat and none of the sides that came along with it. Parking lot was full, but I did get a spot about two blocks down in a more residential area."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,I love that Ciccio's is a local family owned business. The food is good and the prices are reasonable. The service is excellent and the food is good. I've had the steak and the pasta and I was happy. The only drawback is that the pizza is really good. You can't go wrong. There is also a variety of pastas and pizzas. The pizza is really good. The pasta is also good. This is a great place to go out and eat with friends.
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Post-morning plyometric classes, we fuelled our extra-long day with a lunch of fish tacos and a side of poutine (very good), and then a ride on a tricycle (very fun).

If you want to experience a street food experience, the food is served on a street cart that is well lit, so the food is present and visible. This is a big deal, because it means they have your attention!

It's a really interesting food idea, and you can see the"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"3 times I have eaten here and the menu choices are awesome. The food is delicious and the service is amazing. Also the atmosphere is great. The staff is always nice and the house specials are delicious. The best part is the beer is good. We have a lot of friends who love to go there. They have a great menu, great atmosphere, and good service. It's definitely worth the trip. ENDLESS FOOD ENDLESS FOOD ENDLESS FOOD ENDLESS FOOD ENDLESS"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I really like this place. I've always gotten take out but the service was always friendly and welcoming. I've tried some rolls like the volcano roll and dragon roll. They are good but not the best.

I would typically get a rice or yakisoba bowl, they are delicious! Since I like spicy food, the spicy teriyaki sauce the have is great! The best and my favourite order is the Japanese curry rice bowl. The spiciness of the curry which is also a little sweet, and so flavourful!  I highly recommend it if you enjoy curry."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I couldn't decide what to eat because I wanted a sandwich and no one else in my family did. We drove up to Port of Subs and saw Wild Garlic. They have sandwiches! Well, panini but it worked for me. The garlic cheez bites were perfect to snack on while we waited for the rest of our food. I was a bit full after eating them so I couldn't finish my entire panino. I'm looking forward to the leftovers. The staff was super friendly and the place was clean. We will be back and often"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I love this place! I have been here 3-4 times now. I live in Clearwater and would gladly make the drive to eat here. I am a big ceviche fan and the Peruvian style ceviche is amazing. I love the spiciness and variety of corn and sweet potatoes you get with it. The ceviche itself is what I come for and when it's just my fiancé and I, I can pretty much just get full on be ceviche. I think about this place whenever I am getting a ceviche craving. I'll be back again soon!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I rarely write reviews but I must tell you that this is truly awesome pizza. I always eat there with my girlfriends and they always love it. Great beer selection as well. 
The crust is always so soft and crispy, the sauces are so good, the pizza is always so good and the atmosphere is so relaxing. 
So the best place for a good pizza and a great place for beer. 
The pizza is always so good but I've never had a problem with the staff."
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"I recently went inside to get a burger, and was greeted by a cute little girl and asked if I wanted to grab a drink. I said yeah, I'm a big girl, so I'm fine with a glass of water. The girl then said ""the burger isn't ready yet"", and there was a long wait. The girl then said ""I'll just give you a order"", but she didn't take my order - I asked her to fill it up, and she left."

and it was almost lunch time.

Called in while I was shopping.

Ordered the cashew shrimp lunch and the schezuan egg plant with chow mein.

Order would be ready in 25 min...

Enjoyed the beautiful day looking at the snow peaked mountains..

Walked over and there was one table being used.

Waited another ten minutes for the order.

$19.92 for two lunch combos, included soup, and vegetable egg roll, fortune cookies (dogs love them)..

Better than expected and will certainly try another lunch in the future.. just order ahead.. or be prepared to wait.

Glad I stopped and ordered."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food wasn't bad but the service was terrible.  Several minutes after we were seated, our waitress brought drinks to our table for another table.  A few more minutes and our waitress returned to take my drink order but never asked for my husbands drink order.  She never told us the specials. The food arrived before our drinks arrived!  The house ""sparkling"" water was tap water in a recycled glass water bottle.  In our opinion, don't waist your time.  We suspect the 5 star reviews are from the wait staff."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My husband and I came in for lunch, a Friday, about 1 p.m. The food looked delicious, but we left before ordering...because no one waited on us beyond giving us water. We sat for about 20 minutes, room was about 3/4 full, and there appeared to be several employees wandering the room. We heard a few people requesting their checks. The disorganized staff will likely keep us from returning. We did asked to order, and the waiter told us he would be right back. He then started cleaning tables, and walked by us several more times."

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"New owner! Poor food quality, overpriced. I ordered the fried chicken sausage (dont make this mistake again, it was a dry dog) and my refried beans. My refried beans were oily, their refried beans were oily, their rice was oily, etc. I was given the same exact rice and beans at different stores but apparently they were the same. It was a huge waste of my hard earned money. I asked if I could get my money back and received a $5 credit."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,Our stay here was great. Staff was friendly and the food was good. One of our meals was a classic dish of chicken. The other entree was a chicken taco with a side of beans. The chicken was great and the beans were more like beans for a taco. I would recommend this place to others. They have a full bar and the price is right. I would go back to try another dish but it is a little pricey. END OF THOUGHTS END OF THOUGHTS END OF THOUGH
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat during their happy hour and I wasn't disappointed. The $4 ""snacks"" (basically appetizers) are a great deal and portions aren't tiny at all.

Food: Very tasty! I got several to split with my friend. The stuffed cheese puffs were great (imagine a small puff pastry filled with cheesy goodness) as well as the mac and cheese. The bits of bacon in the mac and cheese were a great touch. The hummus with the ""boxty"" (basically potato pancakes) were good as well

Staff: Friendly and very outgoing, great combo!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Awesome! Just try it for yourself, you will agree. A few things were not to my personal liking but that doesn't mean it wasn't awesome. The pu pu tray was awesome, the egg foo young was really good. Mongolian beef was nice and tender the sweet-and-sour pork was awesome as well as the curry tofu was delicious. They just remodeled and everything was so clean the atmosphere is nice the restrooms are clean you don't feel gross going in there which I can't say is true for most Chinese restaurants in the area that I've been to."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I'm a big fan of the food at Tijuana Flats but this location doesn't really wow me in any way the few times I've been in.  I've waited in a slow line to order most of the times I've gone and if you're dining in the tables are usually dirty and require a pre-clean with the napkins on the table before sitting down.  I'm usually used to the staff coming around to check on you during the meal and offering up refills, but it's only happened once in the handful of times I've eaten here."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Absolutely delicious!! 

We (group of 7) arrived around 2:30 pm, and were seated right away. They had plenty of time before the food was served so we were able to get some drinks and enjoy the ambience. The food was absolutely delicious. We even had fish and chips which was just as great. The service was great, especially from the hostess. I will definitely be going back again."
Restaurants,1.5,CG,"As I said service sucked. Tried to order a burger and put ""Steak"" on the menu, but my server said the burger was just one steak. I told her the burger was two steaks, and she looked confused and gave me the wrong one. So, I tried to go to the other menu, and she gave me a burger with two steaks, with the wrong steak. I asked for a second burger, and she gave me a burger with one steak and said ""Oh, you"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"I have been ordering pita chips and hummus from them for the past couple of years and they are always freshly made and always delicious! I've never had the worst of hummus, but I have heard that the pita chips are the worst. Also, I've been waiting for over an hour for my hummus to be delivered, and I haven't been able to get a single hummus so far. I think that's a problem with the delivery service, and I would like to know why they don"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I took business clients to dinner here on a Thursday night. It was quite busy but not slammed. The setting is beautiful, no casino smoky smells, and the service was top-notch. We had three appetizers and all were delicious. Cotton candy martinis are not to be missed. Our table had seafood lamb and steak. Everything came out delicious. Although no one ordered desserts they brought a huge plate of homemade cotton candy and each of us got a small box with two cookies.  Perfect spot for a special occasion or if you are trying to impress someone."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"We passed this restaurant several times and said we need to try this place. Very glad we did. SERVICE IS GREAT, FOOD IS GREAT, FOOD IS FRESH and the Sangria is the best. We went back a week later and Roland (a waiter) came over and remembered we were up from Florida, made a great impression. We belong to the Elks Lodge in Florida and we stopped into the High Ridge Lodge and Talked up this restaurant to any member that would listen. We will be back when ever we come back to High Ridge Mo."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Fast and friendly service, really good food! My husband and I often disagree on what makes good bbq, as he likes it to taste super smoky and I do not! :) I LOVED my Caesar salad with pulled chicken and his brisket sandwich was REALLY good! We were both pleased! My daughter  is celiac and found safe options that she loved also! Oh yes, the fried chicken skin appetizer was AMAZING (not GF) and the deviled eggs (GF) were quite good! None of the side dishes we tried were anything special, yet we were REALLY pleased overall."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Quite possibly one of the best places to eat in the area! They have a huge selection of different items and it is all very reasonably priced, but some of the prices are higher than others. My favorite is their mac and cheese, which is a bit on the salty side and yet comes with some great bread and meatloaf. I can't wait to come back and try more things! Definitely don't go if you are looking for a quick meal but if you are looking for a healthy option and you don't"
Restaurants,2.5,CG,"Cocky, rude and sketchy place/people. You don't need to pay for a salad or a drink. There is a store inside the building called Ace of Spades.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I came here with my best friend for a girls night. Neither of us are from Nashville and we decided to pop into Skulls for dinner. We did not have a reservation and (luckily) were able to grab a little table by the bar. 

Our initial server was so nice and helpful. After taking our order, a manager approached us asking if we wanted to move to a main dining table. We did (right next to the stage). Our ""new"" server was also amazing!

My favorite thing we ordered-- Duck Empanadas  


10/10 recommend for food, service and the show."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We've always loved Jake's, especially the roast pork sandwiches.  Now that they are serving breakfast on Greentree, we decided to give it a try and were not disappointed.  The menu is current and innovative, pleasantly atypical of the local diner fare. From red velvet waffles, chicken & waffles and a variety of omelets including chorizo with mozzarella, roasted corn and green peppers, just to name a few, we were thrilled to see this type of menu in Washington Township.  Our server was attentive and pleasant.  Give Jake's a try.  It will be worth it."

Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We love a good breakfast. You can order from the menu. The pancakes, eggs and sausage are always amazing and full of flavor. The sausage is so moist and yummy. We have tried the biscuits, omelets and pancakes. They are all amazing. The place is clean and has a nice atmosphere. The staff is friendly, but sometimes a little overworked. The staff is always checking on us and we are always happy to see them. We would definitely recommend their breakfast and sit down lunch, breakfast and dinner."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"didn't get a chance to speak with him about any of his work. I had to go to the wrong place for this.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I can only speak to the drinks here, but I loved everything about our experience at Sassafras. The bar is absolutely beautiful. Even the women's bathroom was pretty (there is literally a full sized couch inside). The space was crowded, but not obnoxious, and we were able to get 2 seats at the bar on a Saturday night. My husband had a beer, and I ordered the Summer in Manhattan. I love bourbon drinks, and this one tasted light and refreshing with the orange bitters and orange zest. I look forward to returning, trying another bourbon drink and the food!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The Raging Sage is one of the best coffee houses in Tucson. The coffee is wonderful and strong, the pastries and baked goods are delicious, and the baristas are friendly. I love the cool atmosphere that is rustic and warm, with a nice outdoor seating (although you have to keep in mind it can be loud because it's on Campbell). 
The only thing to be weary of is when it gets busy, since there is one cashier it can be a bit of a wait to get coffee at a rush. In the end though, it is definitely worth it."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,Foods good! Blue haired girl at register not so good. Be aware when taking payment by card. The register has a 20% tip set as a default tip. Very presumptuous for take out !!! and very rude attitude when I declined to pay it. I purchased a Diet Coke as I waited and was told twice to put my mask on as I was sitting drinking the soda they sold me. I guess I should have given them the twenty dollar tip they suggest or I could just not go back.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Started out as a maybe but the last couple of months have been a lot of fun! I feel like I'm getting the best of both worlds. The food is always superb and the whole atmosphere is relaxing and welcoming. The place is small but well laid out and the staff is always friendly. The drinks and the food are great and the music is always fun. You can have a little fun here but the vibe is one of the best in the area. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Best sandwiches in town/california! I love a good ol' fashioned breakfast sandwich and don't even bother with any of the fast food joints. Their sandwiches are great and their salads are so yummy! The best part is they even have a nice selection of wines, beer and spirits to go with your breakfast! After I made my friend a sandwich, she wanted to stay in the kitchen to work on her homework. I wish I had the opportunity to get a salad as well! I love the place and will be back soon! "
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"Really surprised by the low-key atmosphere, the drinks were decent, and the food was great. The vodka mojitos were a nice change from the usual, and the fried-beef hotdog was also excellent. We're not big on the drinks, but the food was good. Overall, I'd say it's a good spot for a casual first date, but not a great place for a date to spend the night. END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END END"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Best Bahn Mi sandwich and side salad I've ever had!  I love great sandwiches. The Blue Owl's Bahn mi has THE perfect baguette bread- a flavorful crisp, crunchy crust on the whole bread, and very light, fluffy inside that perfectly absorbs this sauce from heaven. The pork was succulent and the sauce really brought out the meat flavor, balanced perfectly well with crisp, fresh veggies inside.

The White Ale was the perfect complement to my lunch here.

I don't want to just come back, I want to bring all my friends and family to let them experience this good ness for themselves!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I was waiting for my mom and daughter to complete their visit to the WWII museum, so decided to hang out at this bar on a Tuesday. OMG! They have $2 STRONG Milagro tequila drinks. 

The bartender forgot to put in my queso order, so I ended up ordering the fried Buffalo ribs for my mother, daughter and me. My mom said it was one of the best things she had in all of New Orleans. Before retiring from the hospitality industry, she worked in many high end spots in Dallas...so she's not easily impressed. She's still raving about the ribs."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Ended up at tomo as a 2nd option, only because it wasn't on our Saturday route.  Almost kept going to the 3rd option when we saw the outside of the building.  Not that it's bad looking it appeared more like a dentist office instead of a Japanese steakhouse from the outside!!  But to our dismay ONE THOUSAND % glad we stayed.  The entire staff was extremely friendly and polite.  The food was .  The chef was very entertaining, nothing negative to say about our experience at all!!!! Definitely will be going back, and probably often."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"We were immediately greeted upon arrival and food was delivered quickly. The lamb came with a shelled fruit salad, but I had to ask for more. It was fresh, but the salad was not. The lamb was very dry, but the salad was very fresh. The lamb stew was good, but it was not served in a bowl. In addition, the lamb was very salty, and most of the pieces were raw. We will not be returning.

We ordered the lamb and the lamb curry, but there was one meat"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Closest pizza to Italy we have tried! The staff was very friendly and we had a great experience. They are a repeat customer. The pizza has a very distinct flavor to it and the crust is soft and chewy and the sauce is fairly sweet. This is the first time we've been in Italy but I'm glad we made it here. The prices are great and the atmosphere is cozy and it's a fun place to eat! Happy hours are always good and I highly recommend their pizza.

Unusual but that's what I love about this place so much different stuff that allows for endless combinations of delicious breakfast food. The bagel was fresh and very tasty, the muffin I got was also very good. The service was good as well and the girls were very nice. I think their names were Abby, Sarah and Hannah, they were very friendly and made sure we were happy with our food. Look forward to coming here over winter break"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was really disappointed by this place. Ordered the potato gnocchi which was a joke..it's more like a soup than a pasta dish and the portions were TINY. I finished eating all the gnocchi in about a minute. However, the ribs my boyfriend got and chocolate chili pie were to die for. They were good enough to increase the rating but, like I said, portion size is way too tiny - the dessert portions were just as big as the entree portions, which is crazy, entree portions should be bigger. Walked out feeling like I'd had more dessert than my actual meal."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"If you're looking to splurge and have a fabulous finer dining meal, this is your place. Everything from ambience, to service, to food was impeccable. 

   I highly recommend the Scalibut Fish, which is one of their signature dishes. It was hands down in the top 3 best pieces of fish I have ever had. The couple appetizers that were ordered were also phenomenal. The pork belly, the fish fried like chicken wings (super innovative & yummy), and the the lobster dumplings were absolutely amazing. That lobster butter is to die for! 

   I definitely recommend this gem."

Restaurants,3.5,OR,I've been a patron at this restaurant for about 10 years now and the food is definitely up there with the best of them. However the customer service could be better. The wait is always long so you try to call ahead to place your order but no one EVER answers. The girls who serve all have terrible attitudes if you choose to speak to them in English. It's unfortunate because the owner (who use to be there often and was always extremely friendly) is never really there anymore. But like I said the food is great especially their mofongo and bistec Saltiado.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Hands down one of my favorite spots in Nashville! I go here to work for morning coffee, for lunches, cocktails, dinners and just to hang. Such an incredible space and I've taken every out of town visitor this year. My only complaint would be how loud it is- a little bit hard if you're needing to have a lunch meeting/talking to someone that might have a harder time hearing.

The food and cocktails are spectacular and so is the coffee. The servers are incredibly friendly. I highly recommend the cauliflower salad and chicken wraps. 

Make reservations- even for lunch! You'll be glad you did!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Pre covid review that was lost in space .... This super hip spot out on the main line was a great spot to take a little time and enjoy my coffee. I had already eaten but it I would have lovely to eat here looking at the avocado toast or one of the amazing looking pastries.

The decor made me really happy- although the chairs are not all that comfortable.  The spot to grab is the couch or leather chairs. 

They turnover seams pretty quick although it seems like the couch along the wall is the remote work hangout. 

Overall really great find."

We got the salmon and shrimp as main courses and the salmon was so tender and delicious. The shrimp was also amazing and the service was great. We highly recommend the salmon. I'm so glad I got the Alaska-style salmon and shrimp. This place is definitely my new go to place for wonderful food. ENDLESS SALMON! ENDLESS SHRIMP! ENDLESS LAMB!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,We of course started out with the toasted ravioli...They were great.  I had a burger that was on garlic cheese bread.  It wasn't quite what I thought.  I thought it would be on Italian garlic cheese bread.  it was just a regular bun with cheese and garlic butter.  The bottom bun was extremely soggy.  It was ok though.  My wife had the Spanakopita which was fantastic. (I ate what she couldn't as always...one of the reasons I'm fat).  I shouldn't have gone to an Italian/Greek place to get a burger.  Everything else is usually great.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,If you want some really good seafood this is the place. The lobster was sooo good and my steak was super tender! We loved the food here but unfortunately the service wasn't up to par. Which concludes the 3 stars. I won't say any names but our server messed up the ticket twice. She disappeared for awhile too. I'll keep it short but we'll definitely be back for the food but as for that server I'll be sure I won't get her next time. But everyone else that helped our table was so helpful. I'll be back for sure and do an updated review.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The atmosphere alone will make you feel like a million dollars, though you'll need half that back to pay the tab.

Food is defenitely of the ""less is more"" school whereby diminutive servings seem to convey a specialness that may not actually be there. $10 for one lonely scoop of ice cream the size of a medium egg? Hmmm...

The service is as you'd expect; deferential, stuffily polite and a tad slow.

The hamburger is $14 and quite good.

Finally, be sure to visit the lobby upstairs and the oakroom bathroom on the way out; they are awe inspiringly classic and cool.

Overall, a very fine if costly outing."

Food here is great. We've been once with not so great service and twice with good service. The food takes a while so go with the mindset to chill and enjoy. The drinks are always good. It's a fun atmosphere especially on weekend nights. The only downfall is if there are smokers, the smoke billows because it's a cozy boxed in area. I was surprised it was allowed even though it's outside. We had to leave early because of it, but other than that it's a great place and I will dream about those fries and drink until next time."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Quality food at a chain. The bar area is nice because of the live music, and it is first come first serve so when the wait for dinner is long, we try to grab a spot in there. And the wait for the seated area is usually always long during dinner hours. The food is pretty good but not the best Ive had. I recommend the flatbreads! It's also a little pricey. I do like how the menu is all fresh items and under 475 calories, it makes eating out feel less guilty and still tasty. So I continue to go back for that reason."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The guy in front of me had a large order which gave me time to refamiliarize myself with the menu. I think it's been two years since I had Chipotle and that was in California. Thankfully the menu hadn't changed much and carnitas were available. I got a bowl, basic which kinda confused the employees ""no sauce, no sour cream?"" However, I did forget to get onions and peppers but the guacamole made up for it in flavor.

On the other hand, I am extremely disappointed with spoiled ingredients in my order and the employees handling money then handling my food.

Absolutely horrible! Again the meal was untouched when I saw it. It had 2 pieces of chicken and the coffee was missing condensed milk. I would not say otherwise if it indeed was as expected. My expectations are nothing as far as a refund. Just using a review site to make a honest review."
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Over the past several years, it seemed the ownership / management has been changing every year or two.  Went there several times over the past few months - and I loved it.  Seems their food is back to the way it was over 10 years ago / the old original style pizzas w/ savory cheeses, fresh ingredients, broccoli rabe is fresh & tasty, strombolis & calzones are awesome & done to perfection.  The workers & servers are super friendly - and not like the ""soup Nazi"" from Seinfeld that they've had a few years ago.  I highly recommend giving them a shot."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I would recommend getting their burgers, especially the chicken and the fried chicken. The prices are very fair, especially for the food.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,Such a disappointment is all I can say about the service. They don't have a smile on their face. I asked for a menu and they changed it and I wanted to go to the front to order. They always want to do the same thing. The waitress took forever to get back to me with my food. The food was cold. Even when I used the microwave. I don't know how they got to the cold food or what they used. I was happy to be there. They have a good service and the food was good.
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Service is excellent and the ambiance even better. AlthoughI wanted something that had live músic since it was Broadway Street in Nashville. Maybe an acoustic set with violins or something.

I had a burger with blue cheese which was tasty. We had the chilled mixed sea appetizer. Those crab legs and Boston oysters were very good and fresh. 

My wife had the 6 oz Filet Mignon which was good. Another friend had the lamb which I have had better but it was tasty. And the MAC n cheese were cheesy. Tator tots were. It mind blowing, but you can't go wrong with that. Shareable up to 4 people."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is a joke. I don't understand how it has so many positive ratings. I booked a reservation on OpenTable based on the positive reviews here and there. The band that played was onstage maybe 20 minutes of my dining experience (I arrived at 7 pm, not a tall ask at that time), the service was atrocious, and the portions were laughably small. If your portion size is small, I better at least think it was the best few bites of food I've ever put in my mouth. 

They care more about presentation and aesthetic than the food itself. Save your money, please go somewhere else."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Came here for dinner after a long day of work. I was seated in the bar area and the bar was large and had a large, communal table.

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I've been here 4 times in maybe as many months. Each time I've liked it less and now I strongly dislike their food. The servers are always great and I like the way the place looks. Their rolls are just ok and their lunch boxes are flat out bad. They charge for tea and I always feel like the dishes, cups and chopsticks may not really be clean. 

Ultimately, I probably won't try it again. Each time I've gone so far it was with the hope the previous visits were flukes. With Mikado less than 3 minutes down Route 70 there is no reason to go to Kabuki."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Such a great interior! I want to have a tea party in here!

A tad bit pricey but that could be normal for bakeries (I'm more of a donut shop girl myself).

The egg nog macaroons are $2 a pop but very tasty. The red velvet was a little too sweet and didn't give me the same taste as the best red velvet cakes I've had so I wouldn't recommend this flavor. And the pistachio was yummy. A hint of mint amongst a slight nutty flavor. 

I'll be back to try some of the other baked items but I do see this as a treat vs somewhere you'd come regularly."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"The best kept secret in Gentilly! This place is everything you want and more! They take a New Orleans favorite and stuff it with delicious selections from grilled shrimp to their Creole Queen beignets stuffed with crabmeat, crawfish, shrimp and crawfish sauce...phenomenal!! They don't stop there! You can get sweet stuffed beignets as well...the pecan pie and the Oreo are my personal favorites. Imagine a perfectly cooked beignet stuffed with the perfect pecan pie filling. Literally what dreams are made of! If you haven't tried this place then what are you waiting for?! *COVID-19 note: They are open for pick up and you can call ahead* #yelplove #nolayelp"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I've been meaning to post about this for months now, but it was only a few months ago I had to move out of this place and finally been able to get in. This place is good. I've been very impressed with the food, the service, and the quality of the food. The bbq sauce is one of my favorite things. I haven't tried all of the menu items yet, but I've had some of the croquettes and shrimp sandwich. I've also had the Asian chicken, and the chicken was pretty good."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Food allergies beware!!

Let me first say that the food is good, but the service is lacking. We were there at a busy lunch hour and the servers were mostly stuck in traffic. We waited for 5 minutes and were then given a long line to get our food. The only reason we even came here at all was because we were starving and wanted to eat. The food was soooooo bland and they didn't really give us an option on what we wanted to eat. There were no options for side dishes and we were left with 2 types of pizza."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Unique.Creative.Divine.Delicious. a favorite...

Ask for: Kerri & try their HONEY! you ask why? trust me, i wanted to grab a spoon & eat it on its own.

Each server is very passionate & willing to explain each dish, cheese or wine options. Sit at the bar ask questions. They will give you all the best pointers & maybe even a little taste of a wine. 

Food was divine. Ordered a cheese platter, perfection. Bruschetta: sauteed broccoli & truffled mushroom (my favorite of the 2 was mushroom). TRY duck/spinach salad, so delicious. Also Each selection is unique and you can definitely 'taste' the passion in the kitchen by each bite you take."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Salty's this evening.  As first time customers, it will be on our list of places to return when we make it back to town.  

They have a good kids menu, enough to keep the little ones content with options like burgers, Alfredo pasta, chicken, shrimp, quesadilla, etc.  

We started with the Crabby Dip which the whole family enjoyed but feel it was a little overpriced at $14.  For the main course I enjoyed a Salty Burger while she had the macadamia crusted grouper, both were excellent choices!  Service was spot on making this a five star experience for us!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Came here with the girlfriends on Friday for a potluck event in the evening. We wanted to try the bbq but we were told it was closed. No word on why. Wasnt really impressed with the food. The potato salad was very over salted, the Bbq was pretty bland (no meat or veggies), and the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were greasy. Less than a mile from the freeway, but would be great for a quick bite to eat. We went in and they were closed."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,I could not possibly begin to describe how I feel about this company. I have never been more impressed by the work they have done and the overall experience. I have been in the industry since 2009 and have been fortunate enough to meet some amazing people. This is by far the best place I have ever been to. They have given me great advice on the market and they have listened to my concerns and given me the best advice I have ever had. They are the best and I have been in contact with them and they have been very kind and helpful to me.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"You know the drill - you have an hour plus to kill, your favorite baseball team is live on the bar TV and a drink or two would be nice before flying. You expect it to be costly, weak, watered down drinks. You will get that here - but a margarita (with a Grand Mariner floater) that tastes more like pineapple than lime and orange? Burger was middle of the road with tiny shoestring fries. Plenty of rabbit food, bun was good - over all three stars. On second thought a draft beer (how can you mess that up) and some home made jerky would have saved me 50 bucks........"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I got the same thing I had at the other location, the five and dime. It was so good, I didn't even think about trying anything else. The gravy has a small kick to it, chicken is tender, bacon is thick, egg is cooked to your liking and the biscuits are fresh! It is a ton of food! 

This is my first time at this location. I ordered online and it was ready when I arrived. I also got the maple iced latte. It was made perfectly! If I lived closer, I would stop there for just a latte on the regular. I will be back to try something new!"
Restaurants,3.0,CG,My wife and I frequent the restaurant in the evening. The food is good and is reasonably priced. I have never had a bad meal here. I am glad they have a little more variety than the other restaurants in the area. The meat is always reasonably priced and the service is always good.

Restaurants,2.0,OR,"Awful. We placed the order from the app.. They didnt have our order when we arrived. She said they have had issues with the on line ordering. 45 mins later we finally left with our food. A lady came in after us, ordered and left, and then came back and ordered two more meals and left again as we still didn't have our order. I don't know how it is possible that we had to wait 45 mins for a smokehouse family meal. We will never come back here again. There was an accident that happened right as we were arriving was cleared from the road by the time we left!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If I could give -10 stars I would. I put in an online order at 7:00pm. Food was supposed to be ready by 7:35pm. When I got there I was told to wait another 5 mins, no biggie.... finally 20 mins went by and still no food.  I finally asked someone, the woman rudely said ""not ready yet"". I was standing waiting until 8:30pm & I had enough. I had no choice but to ask for a refund. No explanation given or apology. I was warned about the service but decided to see for myself, I should've listened. First and LAST time here. Thank god there's a Chick-Fil-A close by."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"What better food to indulge in while on vacation than a stellar lobster roll? I personally don't really LOVE little sea creatures as a main dish, but I really did enjoy these lobster rolls. My husband loved it so much he seriously thought about ordering a second! We both had the gin slushies and man, oh man, were those a treat. They were so good I wish I had asked for the recipe. We ordered the whoopie pies as a dessert and while very good, we were almost too stuffed to enjoy them. 

If you haven't been and are wondering where to go for a dinner splurge Peacemaker is THE place!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This place is bad and does not deserve to be called a restaurant. The food is so bad and the service is horrible. They probably opened in a different state than the one we live in and were not aware of how bad the situation is. The food is so bad, I would not eat there again. The service is also horrible. When you come here, you have to wait. I mean, you have to wait for 30 minutes in the dining room without any service. You can not order anything or have a drink or have your food taken away because they are so busy being"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Wow what a great place! The food is amazing and the service is great. My husband and I had a great time. We ordered an appetizer and a salad and both were delicious! The salad was the ""sweet and sour"" of the night. The basil was a must and was so fresh. The appetizer was a nice, light meal without any dessert. The salad was great as well, but the bread was not my favorite. The bread tasted like it was made of plastic, however, the vegetables were tasty and the salad was great. The only complaint I have is"
Restaurants,2.5,OR,"Not a bad spot to stop and grab a drink. Monday, Thursday and Friday are beer nights. Tuesday wine night and Wednesday is vodka night. Most specials are $3! There is also a happy hour menu from 4-7 and 9-close. The service can be a bit slow but the manager will normally walk around and make sure everything is ok. Sit at the bar for quicker more personable experience.  If you are lucky enough to get a survey it's worth taking because you can get a free appetizer! Over all don't go in expecting the world and you will be just fine.

Best items - French dip, Prime Rib Pasta, Cowboy Sirloin."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"First let me say that the owners of Jade Garden  are the two nicest people I've ever dealt with. However tonight Friday, October 2 I ordered online at 5:37 and at 7:08 I got a refund saying that they haven't even started my food yet. At least I got my money back however I feel sorry for those many people who ordered tonight and did not get their food including those from DoorDash.   My recommendation is this, if you are swamped it is better to serve the people that have ordered rather than to take more orders and tell them an hour and a half for their dinner

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Great place for a bit of a hike or walk to downtown. We walked to the front door and took a coupon for the food. The line was pretty long and there were not that many people in line for the food. Food was good, portions were big and hot. They have a parking lot out back. The only complaint is that the food isn't as hot as it could have been. There was food from yesterday and today. We didn't really have time to eat it, so it was a bit of a disappointment. I would recommend this place."

This is the breakfast of champions. The waffle station is not bad. My only negative comment is that the waffle is not the best. The bread is always a little stale. And the Eggs Benedict are very runny. Soup and Omelettes are good. Lunch

This is a good place for lunch. Not for breakfast

The cafeteria is a little crowded. Breakfast

By far the best breakfast. The eggs are always fresh. The price is reasonable."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"This place was decent. I over ate per usual at sushi. I will say this Washington girl loves her fresh fish. We're a little to south from home for that. It was good and the sushi chefs were really cool. They both were very welcoming and made our rolls quick. They even offered desert and we did get there late. Online it said 930, the door said 9 and the menu said 930. We got there at 830. So an hour should be fine. It was confusing and felt like we shouldn't stay at first, then the chefs were just very chill. It was a great birthday dinner for the three of us."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Couple days ago I ordered Uber eats from this place I ordered lamb curry with rice and plain naan(bread) , naan was good and fresh but lamb curry wasn't like wow what lamb curry was like somebody cooked with out patience because I know very good about Indian food have to make with a lot love and patience and about Rice was like sushi rice so sticky rice and unprofessional point : I texted to Uber driver about some extra curry juice but they said I had to pay extra for that,they had  not any option for pay extra !!! 
I gonna give them other chance but this time gonna dine in."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,Came here for their spicy chicken and it was amazing. The food was so fresh and very flavorful. The waitress was so friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back for the spicy chicken. I'm so happy I found this place because it's awesome and I recommend everyone to try it.
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Every single thing we are told is coming this week has been and will be changed, added or removed. I think the service has really been a disappointment. The waitress is really pleasant but the staff is really bad. My favorite restaurant is still closed for good. Food is really good but service is really bad. I would never go back.

Overall, I would say this place is one of the worst restaurants I have been to. I don't like what they are doing to their menu. I think they should just go to the next best place.

I would give this place"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Great food, great service, all employees seem happy, lots of smiles. The atrium's are amazing. Love the water, waterfalls, plants, flowers. The pools are clean, there are activities for kids and the fitness center is great. They offer a military discount. We stayed with other family members, each of us in a different atrium with amazing views. If you can afford it, get a balcony room. With your room you also get free admission to the Wild horse. The food at the various restaurants - great!  The blood orange breakfast mimosa was delicious!  We stayed once, won't likely stay at the hotel again but we will visit, walk around and have meals."

Why are they not required to wash their hands before they do anything? I'm glad they're not an establishment that I can order food from. If they don't wash their hands before they do anything, then they'll never clean their hands when they do something dirty.

I have a problem with people who have issues with me. I have a problem with people who have issues with me.

Restaurants,5.0,OR,"Welp, that was a fantastic lobster roll!  

Got a roll at this week's Gecko fest in Gulfport for $19 and it was fresh and perfectly seasoned and full of big chunks of lobster meat. 

I almost gave up on a good lobster roll locally but this place blew me away!  Tasted just like lobster rolls in New England.

Was standing w/ my roll at another food counter and everyone working at that counter was commenting on how good it looked and asking where I got it. 

Can't wait to come across these guys again and try the Lobster Bisque + another lobster roll!  Believe they are usually at the Tuesday market in Gulfport."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Loved loved loved this place! Went with my fiance for lunch after some water activities earlier in the a.m.. Got the hot combo appetizer with beer boiled shrimp (YUMMY, our favorite), garlic baked clams (my personal favorite), steamed mussels and clams, and oysters rockefeller. Then, followed it with the blackened white sea bass with a side of their famous clam chowder (best clam chowder I've ever had, HANDS DOWN!), fries and cole slaw. Loved every bite of everything. Would recommend to anyone. If you've never tried seafood or think you don't like it, try it! If you don't like Brophy Brothers then you know you just aren't a seafood lover, but it is by far awesome!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We ordered three pizzas at 6p on a Friday night. A young man had them at my door at 7p. Great response time for a weekend when it was freezing out. Here's the funny part. One of the pizzas we ordered was all the meats. It wasn't in the order. Instead was a pizza that was 2/3 plain, 1/3 chicken and spinach. We were a little disappointed but far hungrier to care. About five minutes later the doorbell rang and it was the same gentleman with the correct pizza. 

Make a mistake? No big deal. Make a mistake and correct it without me having to call? Stellar. Glad to have a good traditional slice nearby finally."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I went to this place on a whim for the first time. We got there about 15 minutes before the restaurant shut down for the night. Took a table for two and my husband got the chicken and rice. It was so good! He was a little on the heavy side, but I was eating it with a large spoon and it was so tasty.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,For a place that is a tourist attraction hospitality isn't a strong point. The hostess is rude and inattentive. The messaging system was not working properly and I had just asked her about it... we ended up waiting an extra 40 min due to her lack of communication with the lady that seats people... we were seated in the front where the hostess could see... our server... I asked for water... waited ten min... asked again this time I asked for 2 so maybe I wouldn'trun out again or choke on my pancake...waited while she walked around not doing anything...finally I just got up and went to my own water.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"If you have never had a deep dish Chicago pizza this is the place to go. It was delicious.  We arrived just about 1 pm and it was still busy with a lunch crowd. Our group of 7 had a 10 minute wait which was not bad. Our server Jayden was very attentive. Their menu had 3 types of pizza. Chicago style, thin crust or extra thin crust. We decided the Chicago was the best choice. 3 of us split a small which is 6 slices and plenty for each. If you are limited on time it takes about 45 minutes for the deep dish! Beer selection was good. No room for dessert. Would definitely recommend."

The breakfast was good, however I was expecting a lot more. My hubby and I had the chicken sliders and they were good, however there was no way that I would eat"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Uh, y'all, this place is the bomb! 

It's got this classy yet rockabilly vibe plus a drink and food selection that will shock you. I'm talking a giant bowl of popcorn covered in caramel sauce and whatnot or a ""pie"" made out of fritos and enough cheese to give anyone a coronary (you know, in a good way!) 

They've even got a little glass tabletop cocktail smoker, and if you're not into that, what are you doing with your life? 

The best part has got to be that they feature a cool movie daily that you can watch from the screening room. Admission is only $5 and they can serve you before the movie starts."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"On the one hand, I'm thrilled that another casual sit-down place opened near my office, but I'm less thrilled that they don't have a lunch menu.

I've been to this location of Iron Hill twice (lunch and a happy hour.) I'm really surprised they don't have a lunch menu, given the amount of offices in Center City. But, the burger I had for lunch was pretty good.

They DO have a happy hour menu (some of their appetizers are discounted, plus a discount on draft beers & wine) which was nice. Our server brought us a variety of beers to taste, which was a nice surprise.

Overall, it's fine - if not exactly what you expect from an Iron Hill location."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Placed an order for carry out. Girl who answered the phone couldn't answer my questions about what ingredients were in any of the wraps on the menu. When she finally got the answer (and she was only partially accurate), I ordered my wrap without cheese. After picking up the order and bringing it home, we found that there was cheese in the wrap. We called to request a new one, and she had no recollection of our order, even though we had just been there. Had to drive back to pick up the no-cheese wrap, and didn't even get an apology. We won't be back - lots of other BBQ places in St LOUIS with much better service."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The two times I've picked up a package of chips and salsa all I want to do is eat them. The chips, the salsa, the salsa, and the chips. So good. They will never disappoint. The only reason I give them 4 stars is because sometimes I forget that I'm carrying a bag of chips and salsa. When I bring them home I'll simply put them in the bag and put it in the fridge. But you have to be careful not to overcook. I've actually gotten up to 4 pieces of salsa without getting a single piece of chips. And I'm not exaggerating."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"We love this place! Ok it isn't exactly in the center of town, but the service is excellent and the food is amazing! I love their mac n cheese and the fried chicken is to die for. The pancakes are so fluffy and the maple syrup they put into the syrup is so divine. Everything is so fresh, and the ingredients are so fresh. I can't wait to go back! Also, the staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is so relaxing! Definitely my favorite place in the area. I hope to be able to visit them again soon!

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Fantastic seafood restaurant in Philly. This is not a cheap place, but is very much worth it. I went there with our daughter and fiancé. The waiter was very knowledgeable and help us with the menu to guide us, given we are gluten-intolerant. Everything was perfect. No complaints on anything we selected. 

I had a red snapper ceviche for appetizer that was fantastic. My main course was just as good. And the restaurant brought us an ice cream taco on the house for dessert as it was gluten-free. 

They just treated us like royalty and we all walked out raving about this restaurant. When we come back to visit my daughter this will be on our list for dinners."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Nothing about this place is spectacular, except the high prices. Service was pretty good, but the food is just plain lousy.  

We have been wanting to try this place for a while and it was a pretty big disappointment. 

I had the famous turtle soup for my starter and it was just meh. For the main I had a gulf drum. It was just okay, but the portion was small especially for the price.  The best part of the meal was the bread pudding dessert which was pretty good. 

Maybe this place was good at one time, but that time has passed. Bottom line, save yourself the disappointment and a lot of cash and avoid Commander's Palace."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Excellent meal start to finish!
Our wait for our entree was about 15 minutes because our server was in a rush. We were seated quickly and had plenty of space to wait. The food was very good. The pork ribs were very tasty and well prepared. The broccoli was very good as well. The shrimp and grits were excellent. My husband enjoyed the shrimp cocktail. The fried pickles were very good and the fried mashed potatoes were very good. The only items we would have liked to have been an additional side of coleslaw was a little bland. The meal was very filling and we had no complaints."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"First stop in New Orleans for a fantastic pizza, and I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the pizza. The crust is really good, I'm not a big fan of the crust, but the flavors are great! The sauce is not overpowering like a lot of pizza places, and it has a great flavor, especially with the chilli sauce. I was also surprised by the size, I expected it to be more bigger, but it's right next to the liquor store, so it's not too big. I will definitely be back to try some more of their pizza.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Pizza is always solid here and the people are nice. Bad experience today. Ordered 2 pizzas on 2 separate orders online. Even though I called to confirm, Someone assumed it was a duplicate order and only made 2/4 pizzas so had to wait for them to make 2 more pizzas while the others (and I) sat there for 15 min.

Anyway, they tried to make it right by upgrading the last 2 to 14"" from 12"", it was a good effort I guess. 

Pizzas were delicious if late to the birthday party. Phosgo is always my favorite, with olives, green peppers and meat, their red sauce is always tangy and rich, very consistent. Will always return but come on Flying Pie!"
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"You must eat here! Great food, great drinks, good prices. We were tough-pressed to make a decision. We split the jalapeño rangoons (yum!) as an appetizer. The husband had the steak and shroom pizza, and boy was it good - plenty of steak, excellent crust. I had a side Caesar salad (I can't imagine how big the regular would be since the side was huge) and a side of their famous mac n' cheese. Loved the lemon zest on the salad - so simple but added so much. Honestly, I wish I could have ordered every one of their salads. I wish I were closer to Nashville because I want to come back and try everything else on the menu!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,burger- super regular nothing special. I have been coming here for years and always have had good food. But this time the food was not good. I ordered the fried chicken nuggets and they were not fried at all. It was just cooked in a skillet. To me it tasted like it was fried in the microwave. I had not been here in a while and they have not changed their menu since I have been coming here. The girl that served me was very rude and never asked if I was ok. She just gave me a very short and rude answer. I will not be going back there. Do not eat at this location
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This was my first time eating here, but I will definitely be back. The food is delicious, the service is great, and the drinks are tasty! I loved the apple pie but it was very disappointing on the other two dishes I tried. The apple pie had a bit of a burnt taste and the bacon was very soggy. The bacon I had was really crispy and the apple pie was really dry. This will be my go-to place on any trip to Southern California. END OF

Great breakfast meat selection though and the bacon is especially good. Nice big homefries.
Short stack or pancakes not so great 
the nutella waffle was good it didn't look like much and would have been perfect if there were more bananas and slightly more nutella but pretty good.
Seems like it's hit or miss. Others I was with also felt the same. Though we all enjoyed the location 
The harvest diner is closer and better so I doubt I will go back here."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Excellent place for dinner. The ambience is very relaxed. Food was very delicious, and the prices are quite inexpensive for the quality of the food and drinks! We got their salads, and being salad haters and just eating them to be healthy, we may be salad converts now after twisted fork. I especially recommend their Kale and beet salad or grilled vegetable salad. Both are light and yet flavorful. You can add protein to it (unfortunately no vegan/vegetarian protein choices yet). The cauliflower ceviche was so refreshing and flavorful. We also got their mushroom ravioli entree- again lighter than other raviolis yet flavorful. For drinks, we got the twisted Merlot and twisted Cab (decent quality again for how inexpensive they were)."

The food was very good and the portions were large and generous. The service was great and the owner/manager seemed to take pride in everything she does.

I will definitely come back for dinner and/or drinks.

Highly recommend this place. And if you're in the South, head over to the Fish Market and choose your favorite fish and take home a plate.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"It's a cute place.  The bar is fun.  The pizza bar is where I would want to sit next.  

I've noticed a weird trend.  In the effort to have bold flavors chefs are deliberately using way too much salt.  Had too salty food at City House, Rolf and Daughters and now Lockeland Table.  Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which was absolutely inedible.  My tongue felt numb.  PIzza sauce was the same--equally salty.  Pizza dough could use more rising time. It was dense and the wood oven can't fix that.  

The over forty crowd doesn't connect to servers that ask whether the food is yummy.  

Thoughtful cocktails and good beer on tap."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"For a place that only makes hoagies how do u fail at that?!?! YOU ONLY HAVE ONE JOB AND Thats to make the only thing this company was created to make!!
 If you cannot fulfill the order as requested than I rather it be canceled or Id atleast get a courtesy call with an update on other options!!! This is ridiculous!! Not to mention the bread was not only not what I ordered which I specifically asked for seedless but I have pics to show otherwise in addition to it being hard and stale!!! No oil, Vinegar or mayo!!

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I kept hearing about this place and was excited to finally try it. I went around lunch time on a Saturday. The place has a sort of cafeteria vibe and the staff seemed to be really young. We ordered cocktails, a mojito and a marg, which were pretty good. We decided to share the guac. It was a little bland for my taste but we added their tomatillo salsa which made it good. Also, their salsas are all in squeeze bottles which I didn't really like. The bean taco was very good. I also tried the fried avocado taco which was a little bland but the avocado itself was yummy. All in all I'd say its a nice option for lunch or drinks."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"By far my favorite sushi restaurant on the westbank. The location and parking is great. Customer service can be very crappy at times which is the reason why they lost a star. If you order to go and you notice your order is wrong once you get home, all they will do is say sorry and ask you to bring it back regardless of how far you may be. They do not believe in giving refunds even if they screw up terribly. Although customer service can be poor at times, the sushi is incredible. I do recommend going and sitting in because you will receive the best experience that way. I recommend the sexiest man alive roll and the hurricane sushi (extra crispy)."

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"Really cool spot to get a good lunch.

We went on Monday and had the fried calamari and a huge salad. The fried calamari was delicious. The salad was nice and fresh. The fried calamari was too spicy for me but the salad was good.

The fried calamari is huge and it was very fatty. The fried calamari is like a fried chicken and it's a big part of the menu.

I would recommend that you try the fried calamari, but it's not the best.

The fried calamari was very nice, but I think it could be a little spicy.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This had became my best choice for Pho's craving recently ! The other favorite Pho noodle houses around Philly have went down hill with their qualities and services. Trust me the Pho broth and meat here is the tastiest of them all. The service is so quick, about 3-5 mins, because they have alot of waiters to help with the order process. I also love the rice and chops plate dishes which are delicious. I wish they expand their menu more with special dishes into their small menu, but that just me. Everything is fresh, tasty, big portion, and low price. I will always come here with friends and family to enjoy authentic Vietnamese cousine . Best around Philly for a quick meals !!!!!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"There's dark lighting throughout the restaurant, which made it hard to read the menus with a big college crowd & loud music - a younger atmosphere with Instagram worthy opportunities including a swing at the entrance & outside bar area where they replaced barstools with swings - pretty cool!

I came here with a couple friends. The $10 unlimited Cabernet & Chardonnay special wasn't enticing enough for me this Thu. from 5-10pm since I prefer Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc. 

I went with a Treehouse Lager (beer) & a glass of Sauvignon Blanc instead, but wished they served me more wine after seeing everybody getting a full glass vs. mine that was less than half full...I didn't try the food, so can't comment about it."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,We drifted into this Cafe after being informed by another reviewer that it was an old school diner. The food was good but the service was slow. The waiters and waitresses were extremely friendly. I could tell that they were trying to make a lot of money out of this place. The service was good and their prices were reasonable. The only reason this place is not 5 stars is the servers. My food came out so fast that I did not even notice that it was not in the order. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with tortilla chips and it was very good. I ordered the steak and it was just ok.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This place is hands down the best informal Mexican restaurant I've visited so far. Located in Barrio Hollywood just a quick drive from Tumamoc Hill, you'll want to finish your hike fast and grab a combo plate with an agua fresca. Good vegan/vegetarian selection; rice and beans are chicken stock- and lard-free, and for fillings you've got the choice of soy chorizo, cauliflower, lentils, squash, and even soy machaca. They deliver all over Tucson the city for $3 extra, although it's certainly worth the trip out. My favorite soups were the fideo and potato tortilla; make sure to add garnish and extra limes. I haven't had caldo this good outside of Mexico. 

The owner, Rudy, was very courteous. Support family-run local businesses like this one!"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"My family and I visited here last night for my sister's 21st birthday. We were seated in the banquet room upstairs which was supposed to be a little more calm, but it was actually the opposite. The parties surrounding us were quite loud, so my family and I  had a hard time hearing each other. Despite the atmosphere, the food was delicious. I got the salmon spring rolls for an appetizer (which were amazing), and the petit filet mignons for my entree. The meal was good, but petit filet is right. It was more potatoes and corn than filet mignon. Overall, the service was good and the food was tasty. This place is definitely worth a try, but it's not one of my favorites."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I could tell you that when you see a person with a locked car, it’s a sign that you have a problem with this person. But in this instance, the sign was that there was a person with a problem with her car. That’s what I thought as well. She was so mad that she had to call the police.

Upon arrival, we were told that she had been told about the parking lot. They said that the police would not be able to come out until the car was towed.

Well, today was Friday, and they wouldn’t be able to come out until Friday afternoon."

I was seated right away, and was able to purchase my custom light blue tank top, it was a perfect fit. I was surprised they had a section for women's tanks, I just wished they had opened it up earlier.

Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I don't understand why this place rates as low as it does. It certainly isn't the best coffee I've ever had, but compared to the other competing local coffee shps, Ike's stands out . For instance, coffee exchange is a great place to study, but their coffee sucks. Shot in the dark is garbage, I have a love hate relationship with epic, cartel's coffee is awesome but pretty pricey, and the hipster feel can be a bit much. I find myself pleased at this Ike's location and the the speedway location. I'm happy to support this local business and I'll keep coming back because the coffee is good and the vibe is cool enough to sit back, study, and enjoy the given playlist at that moment."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"The food was quite disappointing, but the atmosphere and presentation were good.  Staff was attentive. The crab-stuffed shrimp entree had 4 smallish shrimp, with a ball of stuff around each (with no - at least, no apparent  - crab).  The fish entree (meuniere) was incredibly salty.  We ordered house pinot grigo; the wine was not very good; when we got the bill, we learned that the waiter had served us $12 glasses of riesling (note: wine is served in juice glasses).  The side of asparagus contained pieces of asparagus, rather than spears, served in a soup-cup bowl. The veggies served with the entrees were good.  I would never go back.  The J.W. Marriott staff should stop recommending this restaurant."

Rating: 1 star with good reason.

This band is good. If you haven't heard this band before, you haven't been paying attention.

They have a very good sound. They have one of the most unique and unique guitar solos I've heard. I've heard a lot of guitar solos, but this song is unlike any other. It's a good song but it's not anything special. If you are a fan of this band, I suggest you check them out.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Y'all I love this place so much. You cannot have a bad time at Dat Dog. The food is great, the servers are great, the drinks are better than they have any right to be. 

The menu can be overwhelming but the friendly counter guy is eager to help you. I knew I wanted the crawfish dog but couldn't decide on toppings. He recommended the toppings for the duck dog: blackberry mustard, a creole aioli, bacon, other magic. I would have never come up with that combo myself but he was not wrong. It was perfect. 

Fries and tots are not to be missed, either. Crawfish etouffe on tots should be a national dish. Cajun fries make all other fries unnecessary. Have another cocktail. You deserve it."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place is JUST PLAIN NASTY!  In town for work and tired from the flight from LAX. The employees were parting the whole time I was there.

I sat at the bar which looked like it is never cleaned. Again, I was tired and didn't want to look for another place. Ordered a beer and it came in a plastic mug. Might as well have been a Solo cup.

A guy behind the bar was making a HUGE batch of salsa with no gloves. Did I mention I was tired? Ordered the Carnitas dinner which was decent, but being from So Cal I have had much better.

I spent the better half of the night yakking in the hotel  bano. Great way to welcome Monday. Don't... Just don't."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"I love the atmosphere. Really great place to meet people. But if you're coming on a date and want a small bite to eat and a drink while you're there, you'll be sad. I've been here several times and it's not a place where I'd think of coming alone. But if you're looking for a place for a casual meal that's kind of a dive, go for it! Yum! 4.5 / 5

Restaurants,3.0,OR,"The layout of this joint is very weird and made me very confused and embarrassed to find my way around. The Classic Smash I ordered came out dry, salty and disappointing. The fact that they ""smash"" their burgers releasing all the delicious juices results to a very dry burger. The Smash Fries had a strong rosemary and garlic taste was quite delicious however they were overcooked and dry as well. I can appreciate that Glassboro has finally put more options in it's town but I would drive to 5 Guys rather than coming here any day. At least at 5 Guys I can customize my burger and it always comes out juicy and delicious. I can't say so for Smashburger. I have not returned from my last visit."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed my experience here for the most part. The staff is extra friendly and attentive, which is a huge plus for me. I was tad disappointed to find that there were fewer lanes than I thought. I guess I expected it to be a much larger establishment. The parking is minimal, but their drink and food menu is very extensive. The wings had a great flavor and so did the Parmesan fries. I love Frosé and theirs was certainly pleasing to the pallet! They also have bushwackers and good wine and beer selection. They had karaoke start at certain time and it was really fun and entertaining! The virtual golfing is definitely a unique experience. I would recommend for a group of friends for a fun evening!"

The raspberries are really good too. It's a really nice place to come and enjoy a nice meal. This is a must try place! My suggestion would be to bring your friends!

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"This place has been going since its opening in 2001. I have been coming here for a few years now and it has always been great. It is a lot of fun and the menu changes seasonally so you can always find something new. I like to start off with the chicken wings and then order the lamb ribs and they are great. The lamb ribs are very tender and flavorful. I usually order the chicken wings when it's time to eat and they are good too. The fried chicken is always good, and the ribs are always cooked perfectly. The kids love the tacos, and the kids have always been very satisfied. The lunch specials are pretty great too."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I visited here with my boyfriend for a nice birthday lunch, and this place did not disappoint! I tried the pork buns (delicious with thin pork medallions), shrimp and crabmeat tempura, fried rice, shrimp tempura rolls and banana tempura for dessert. I enjoyed being able to order whatever I wanted, but be sure to eat everything or they will charge you for uneaten portions apparantly, so this deterred me from trying new items on their menu. Also, they offer a birthday discount, but you have to go on your exact birth day...not during the weekend, day before, etc. I thought that was petty (since his bday was literally in a few hours), but all in all this is a decent all you can eat sushi spot that we enjoyed."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"I got super excited a new chicken and waffle place popped up, but I'm bummed I wasn't blown away. The service was fantastic, and I love how the dining area looks. The food was just meh for the price. I got a simple waffle with some fried chicken, and coffee maple syrup. The maple syrup is amazing! They have so many different flavors which is fun. The waffle was pretty good too. It was thick and fluffy, but I would've liked to see it cooked a little longer so it would be crispy. The fried chicken was overly salty and even though it was fried nicely, the salt ruined it for me. 

It may have just been that one time, so I would give it another try for sure."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"The service here was very good. The burrito was pretty good for the price and the salsa and guac was yummy. The only thing I didn't like is the price. It's on the high end.

My guess is the waiter wasn't paying attention and they sat under the lamp for too long...  not our first time here, might be another year before we go back because the service was so bad. At least the manager comped one meal and two pieces of cheesecake for the mistake...  never wish someone to not have a job, but that waiter might need less on his plate, so to speak..."

Being a beach front restaurant it can be a tough crowd but they handle it to perfection the bartenders remember everyone's drink and stay on point to keep you're glass full.

The barista had extensive knowledge about the different coffee drinks and I was in the mood to try something different from my usual cold brew. I tried the cortado, which the barista explained is espresso with a bit of warm milk, different from a latte which has more milk than a cortado. It was delicious!! The art was also very gorgeous and it was certainly a nice pick me up in the afternoon. I chose to sit outside as the inside was a bit too crowded. This place is so cute and I will def be back. Also enjoyed the natural ambiance, green walls and wood-based furniture."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Holy crap is this good! My mum and I both ordered the noodle bowl (chicken and pork) and it was absolutely phenomenal. It had all the right favors and the amount of sauce they give you is just right. The only suggestion I would make is to cut the pork belly into bite-size pieces; I was given two large slabs of pork belly and it was a bit awkward to eat with just chopsticks. The coconut pudding is also a great way to end the meal; it wasn't too sweet and was equally as delicious. 

Just keep an eye on the tablet that what you want is actually keyed in. We ordered the spring rolls and they did not make it onto the ticket. Other than that every thing is great!"

I was told they could do a medium but I asked them to go to medium. They took my order and when they took my order they talked to us for 20 minutes and no one said anything. They didn't even say ""hello"" to our server. It was so long that I couldn't even finish my sandwich. I ordered more than the rest of the party ordered. I asked for a free medium with my order and they said no."

I can't stand bad service and the waitress i had here was rude, barely checked on our table (we had about 10 of us), was annoyed with me because I was a vegetarian and wanted to get just a pitcher not the wings. Other friends of mine still go back but always agree with me about the service. 

Bars are about the experience, if I am not treated well, there are plenty of other places I can get the exact same beer, spend my money, and have a good time while being served by good people. Being a server you are the face of the bar and you're the Salesman. If you don't like your job, quit. Seriously."

The raw oyster guy was literally perfect, he told me exactly how to eat them, best way Louisiana style, and also if i liked heat how to kick it up a bit! 

For my main dish I had the catfish creole, OMG amazing! The person i was with had the crawfish pasta which was easily in the top 5% of foods I've ever had! 10/10 would recommend again and again! Don't have a reservation?! Please sit at the bar! It's well worth it!"

We ordered chicken nachos and when they can out there was no chicken. The waitress noticed it before setting them down and took hem back to the kitchen. It was obvious that the sat there till the chicken was ready because everything else on the plate was cold. I don't honk their mistake should have resulted in us having to eat cold food. It should have been remade.

I don't know how to explain it but the fries are excellent, not that dry crinkle-cut fries type junk you find in most bars. Golden little sticks of yum, perfectly salted. The burgers are huge. $4 bucks filled me up and THEN some. 

The bartender there, can't remember his name, makes a perfectly mixed Long Island Iced Tea and other LIIT Connoisseur's know that it's not an easy drink to make without overpowering it with one of the many liquors in the mix.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"Our server was Awesome! We were going to eat there again this past weekend but the wait was 45 minutes and our great server had quit. that sucks. Anywho, on this visit I had the Chicken & Waffles and bae had French Toast with Bacon. It's quaint and it's the third location I believe, but I'm not sure if we'll return. Don't get me wrong food was good but we gave away most of the leftovers and what we retained we didn't go back to. Not heavy, pretty traditional, busy place. Call ahead! I recommend they allow reservations through Yelp or Open Table somebody. Our return isn't my choice, breakfast is bae's thing, I just pay the bill. And while we were going to go this weekend, he said, ""let's go somewhere else."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We heard the Rathskeller was a place to visit while in Indianapolis so we went. Our dinner experience was just ok.  The Rhouladen was good but the schnitzel not so much. Just your average breaded pork cutlet.  Nothing compares to good veal schnitzel. The potato pancakes seemed cooked ahead of time and just ok.  The spaetzle and sauerkraut were good also.   The first baked potato was old and over cooked so we were brought another on request.

Apple strudel was a real disappointment.  Way to many apples and way too little pastry. And not crispy at all!  

For folks that don't know how German food should taste they will probably be happy dining there. It has a nice atmosphere.   For those that know, not so much."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Been here quite a few times. The blueberry pancakes are great. A must try!

We had a few starters for dinner and the salads are great with lots of protein. Everything is fresh and is delicious. We recently tried the chicken wings, they were fresh and tasty. The $18 burger is pretty good. It's a little heavy but it's not too heavy. The fries are good. The bar is clean and the atmosphere is nice. My favorite is the specials, they have a few different ones I can't get enough of. I've been here a few times and it's always good."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,I was first introduced to Cactus Ranch on the corner of Silver Lake and 4th Avenue. I am a huge fan of Mexican food and their food here is amazing. I have never been disappointed but this place is not your average Mexican. I have tried everything from tequila to salsa and the flavors are amazing. I get the El Trio Cuero Tacos and they are awesome. Great service and great ambiance. The food is delicious and the service is exceptional. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area.

Restaurants,5.0,OR,What a cute little place and we were so glad we went there to celebrate our anniversary. Due to covid only 8 customers at most allowed inside dining. We started with lobster ravioli Rangoon and fried spring rolls.Both  were delicious. The rolls were a special for evening. My husband delighted in his duck breast and on a whim I ordered the short rib. Not my typical order by a long shot but it was really good. It was served over mashed peas that I thought were sooo good. Really? Mashed peas? It's true. Waiter surprised us with a little dessert- ice cream. Yummy. I can't forget to mention the Shibuya- kinda like an old fashioned but better. I hate whiskey/bourbon drinks but this was great. Great food and good service- we will be back.
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"I hate that this place is so small - because the food is so fresh and tasty.  The prices are fair for all of the food you receive. Everything I've had is very hearty and keeps me full all day.  Service is usually on the slow side, but only because there are so many people and it is so hectic all the time. I will warn you that the majority of the time, my order comes out wrong if I request small changes (i.e. undressed greens, or no diary/cheese in an omellete). They usually take it off the bill without even asking and bring a fresh plate out right away. The coffee, for the record, is pretty decent. I highly reccomend the Bacado Omellete and a side of bacon to start out with."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Rarely do we find ourselves in the snow or in the rain or even in a freezing rain storm. When we do, we always find ourselves in the narrow, dark and narrow bays. I find this to be a huge problem. It is not a warm or a cold day. We do not see the people at all. We do not have time to get out there. We have to wait for the bus to take us to the store. We have to wait for our food to arrive. We have to wait for the supervisor to come to the door. We have to wait for the person to come out and check the status of our order. I am not sure if it is the supervisor,"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"This is another one of my favorite places. It is located in the Eastern Shores area of Milwaukee. The area is very quaint and people are very friendly. I have enjoyed it there a lot. The food is good and the service is very good. My favorite is the soup. It is very good and I have never had anything that was bad. The atmosphere is very nice. The back part of the restaurant is very pretty. The food is great and the service is good. They are very friendly and the service can be a little bit slow.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Pizza isn't something I would have every thought to order in NO but being in need of comfort food and the packed crazy bars and restaurants during Superbowl we opted for pizza from Vieux Carre Pizza. Boy did it hit the spot. You can buy it by the slice or a whole pie, we had the meat lovers. Not a lot of choices, I believe it was only 4: cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers and a chicken pesto but if craving a slice get it here. Funny thing we did go back for a slice and ate it on the streets and that piece was even better; cheesier, greasier and just plain yummy. Not an atmosphere place, pretty small. Get in line, grab a napkin and be prepared to take it to go on your paper plate."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"Once again, y'all did the d%+# thing! This grilled salmon salad is DA BOMB. Whoever made this salad, your hands must be blessed everything in it tastes fresh and the ingredients are prefect together. My salmon is so tender and flavorful (it's not dry nor boring). I love that it's all spinach & not a bunch of lettuce stalks (that's one of the reasons I don't order salads often. Other places wanna give you a bunch of wet, hard lettuce stalks). I couldn't even wait until I was done, I'm reviewing and eating at the same dang time. And the side of homemade garlic bread is bae. I am sooooo glad that I ordered this salad, I can't wait to order another one from you guys. God bless whoever made my salad today, 'tis truly delicious!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Spend less than 5 minutes, and the food will be fresh.

“I was really impressed with the menu and how they served the food at the counter. The portions were good and I could go on a little bit of bread, or salad, or just have a whole bowl of mac and cheese.”

The three-piece dinner was $11.99, and the share plates were $7.99. Everything was easy to order and the servers took great care of us.

With that said, I was surprised at the quality of the food at this restaurant. The servers were very attentive, and the food was very tasty.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"*updated review* I am so happy to upgrade my review and give 4 stars.  This brewpub is in a new location with a new attitude.  I was warmly greeted by the owner upon arrival.  We chatted at the bar quite a bit about future plans for the pub and the full English breakfast they offer (that's a must if you've never had one). They have a chef inspired menu with British specialities like Scottish eggs and pasties.  Emma was beginning her shift and was just as warm and inviting as ever.  If my memory serves me correct they have 4 house cask pours to enjoy as well as many traditional Brown ales. I hope the new location works out for this family, I will be sure to revisit when in the area."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Fun would definitely describe this place and their clientele.  But to be fair great food needs to be mentioned.  I will admit I live close by and had not stopped in until recently and I must admit now I regret my decision. So now I feel as though I'm trying to make up, I have been here 3 time within a week. Yes it's a bar with the jukebox but it is every bit a great restaurant. Beside that they have amazing weekly drink specials and best of all breakfast is served all day. In terms of pricing they are very reasonable,  I mean come on a ribeye for $16.00 what a deal. When in the near Westside downtown Indianapolis area head over to Illinois and stop in and give this place a try."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"Nestled in the middle of the Appalachian Mountains, this quaint town has its origins in the early 1800's. The town has its own unique flavor, its own charm and it's history is impeccable. The town is a little unique in that it is quite small, one block wide and two blocks long. The town is filled with a variety of shops and restaurants. The town is filled with outdoor vendors selling everything from home goods to local delicacies.

Restaurants,4.5,OR,"All I can say is I am working my down the list until I try all 20 of these amazing burgers just as they are on the menu.  I had the Elvis last night.  Best burger I ever had.  It is going to take a real force of willpower to move onto the next, but it is The Farmhouse and I am dying to try that one too!  Onion rings are big and crunchy and the fries are kitchen made so taste like potatoes and not the freezer.  The pickle chips are great too.

Great bar, great pour, nice and attentive staff, friendly atmosphere, cold beer and many choices, TV has the Preds game on - so stay away!!

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"If you do nothing else in New Orleans, THIS is the visit you must make. Located in the heart of the French Quarter alongside the Mississippi River, under a green and white stripped awning with simple tables and chairs that can accommodate a party of 2 to 10 at a moment's notice. Wait staff run this place like a mill, as you will see the line to get in stretches down the block. However, once you are seated,  time stops as you leisurely enjoy your dense and delicious beignets and cafe au laits. Maybe it's the ambiance,  maybe they include magic in the batter, but I guarantee you, you will hit this place multiple times if you are in the area. Beignets come in threes. Split them among your party. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DON'T WEAR BLACK!"
Restaurants,3.5,CG,"First time at Ishkibbibles, was good.

Next time I'll try the Super Bowl.

The food is decent. I can't wait to try their chicken nugget burgers.

They have a few specials like the Sunday Roasted Lobster with a side of fried chicken.

They have a variety of desserts.

Price is reasonable.

I'm enjoying the food and will be back.

Enjoy!

All food is on sale for $10.

You can also get chicken nuggets for $10 at the counter.

Restaurants,3.5,CG,"So this was the first of a series of posts that I decided to write about the book I bought. Yes, it's a book. I had read a few reviews before selecting this book based on how many stars it earned on Amazon and the number of people who bought it. The reason for this review is I found myself reading the book and it was fascinating. I wanted to buy the book from the library but couldn't so I'm going to give it a try. I'm going to talk about the book and why I picked it up and what I found interesting. So I started reading the first chapter. I was in the middle of reading it and I just couldn't put it down."
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Stopped during a ride through DE.  I was looking for a small coffee shop with a counter.  This fit the bill for the most part.  I do like more greasy spoon, but this was a good stop.  The food was good, I had the biscuits and gravy  with home fries. Not the best I have had but good.  

The service was very odd.  The kid who was serving me was good, but the place seemed to be staffed with young kids ( maybe 21) who just hung around and talked about drinking last night and hating work.  One girl was just standing around doing nothing and talking about wanting to get fired and how happy she would be.  Would not be a reason not to go, but just poor management."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Found this Greek food place by accident. Located on south virginia, Midtown, they have plenty of signs (directions) to get you there. Just follow the arrows :)
THE place is very small and cozy. The owner, is a sweet lady (forgot her name), but yes, she has been there for over 13yrs.
They have about 10 tables, so make sure to go grab your spot. They also are pretty good on the to go food.
I end up ordering the Royale plate. I was curious to try their flavors and I was very surprised, the plate is very generous. Everything goes well together.
For those that don't eat meat, they have a vegetarian option.
The salad that comes in the plate is very flavorful and well seasoned.
It is a good choice to grab and go as well as sit and eat tight there too."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"SInce moving to Philadelphia a few years ago, I've been able to find many great wine bars and restaurants in the city, but none of them have quite the great wines I have found in Williamsburg. I've been to a few and I have to say that almost everything I've tried to drink or have eaten at one of the many wine bars and restaurants has been a failure in the kitchen department.

I recently found out that the owner of and a wine merchant in Williamsburg, Terry Rundell, was an executive at a large wine company in New York City and in fact has been in charge of the process of getting his store in Williamsburg to be in compliance with the stringent regulations that exist there."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"When I rate a place, I do so with no certain criteria in mind. I always use the words ""raw"" and ""fusion"" to describe what I think is good. I love that the meat is 100% raw and the farm-fresh vegetables are organic. But I can't help but get more excited when I think of the sauce of the meat, the beauty of the fruit, the unique textures of the vegetable, and the ingredients for the dish.

The name of the place is a strange one, but as someone who lives in Baltimore, I know it's so great to travel to a place that doesn't have a name. The name is a testament to the quality of their food and the"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Great gluten-free crepes, great location and great atmosphere. I can't speak about the coffee because I haven't had any, but I've tried a crepe with cheese, eggs and sausage and another with bacon and maple. Both were delicious. 

The crepe itself is a little less thin than crepes I've had in the past, making it comparable to a thin sourdough pancake. But the texture was good and the flavor complimented both the savory and sweet contents very well. 

There was no wait when I went there on a Thursday morning, but when I went on a Sunday afternoon, it was packed. The staff was friendly and helpful too. 

Another bonus about this place is that it's located in one of the oldest neighborhoods in town and is surrounded by a great mix of fancy new restaurants and beautiful historical architecture."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"My last visit was about a month ago and again another disappointing dinning experience on the restaurant side. The visit prior to that was in the red head server and this past visit was Sean. I have seen him for years throughout all the visits, but never sat in his station and I won't be begging to come back. I know he isn't new, so what's his deal with mediocre service? I prefer to sit on the bar side where the bartender takes care of us and have always had. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but this one happens to be our daughters favorite restaurant, its not far from home and food has almost always been perfect. If you do dine here sit on the bar side, service is better and do try the prime rib smothered burritos."
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"So I give this review a final score of 5/5. First of all, I am a huge fan of the owner and staff at The W, and I've never felt that they were disrespectful to me or my customers. Second of all, the food is so good, and the service is top notch. We went in on a weekend trip to get something to eat and the whole staff was awesome. We got a free bottle of wine, and I had a wonderful experience. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. We had a couple of drinks and were so happy with the food. I will definitely be back soon. END OF STORY. END OF STORY. END OF STORY. END OF STORY."

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Went here by myself on a Tuesday night and sat at the drinks bar. Oysters were good and comparable prices to other joints. Gator bites were okay. But the item to really get is the bread pudding with whiskey sauce. I had tried several other places in NOLA for their bread pudding and this place finally did the trick. The oyster bar staff was lively and entertaining. The drinks bartender was friendly and solid, not too talkative. He actually had a customer come up and expect him to recognize her from a year ago, and the exchange was awkwardly humorous. ""Hi, er. um. you, good to see you too. ""  We both shared a laugh about it after she walked away. His manager leaned in and let him know that he needs to remember every customer that ever comes in indefinitely."
Restaurants,2.0,OR,"I was house sitting in Kuna for about a month and stopped in at this location a few times.  Definitely still has the shine of a new store.  Unlike others who have reviewed, I had no issue with the food or the staff.  Granted they aren't always the fastest either, but in my experience Carl's (like Jack In The Box) cooks most food to order, so if you go when it's not terribly busy you may have to wait a bit longer for your food.  Love their big chicken filet sandwich and fried zucchini!  If you're in a rush you might want to consider going in (so you don't get backed up in the drive thru lane) or going elsewhere.  Otherwise, sit back, relax, catch up on your Candy Crush and wait for the goodness."
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"I returned to the P.F. Chang's in the Mission, and had a very good lunch. I had the risotto and served with a side of garlic chicken. I enjoyed the risotto. It was very tasty. The garlic chicken was not bad either. For the rice, I had the yakisoba. When the mains were put on the table, I did not try the beef and chicken, but I did not think it was bad at all. The beef was not really a meat, as it was not browned at all. The chicken was very tender, and I think it was done to a medium degree. I have had other chicken in the P.F. Chang's, but it has not"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Went to Tria on the 2nd, and it was... well... yummy!

I've had the Linguini, and it was delicious! I had the Torta, but it was a little bland. I'm not sure if it was the oil/vitality of the torta or the sauce, but it was lacking in flavor. The Linguini was way better.

I had the Duck which was delicious, but the sauce was a little overdone. The sauce was a little too rich for my liking.

Overall, I had a great time at this place and will definitely be back to try their other dishes.

The service was great, and the manager was very friendly"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"Who would have known this place was here??? Like Jason H. said probably only the people that work in this area. I was lucky to find it and very happy with the food. I went for breakfast and decided to keep it simple, ham and egg on a muffin.

With the first bite I had butter dripping down my chin.....I'm an overall healthy eater but this first bite was heaven. I also had their chocolate cake and even though it wasn't anything special it was also very good. 

I couldn't find the menu online so here is the breakdown. Open only during the week for breakfast and lunch. Food options: hot and deli sandwiches, omelets, grits, burgers (including veggie burgers) pancakes, french toasts, salads and some fish options. There is a $5 minimum credit card purchase and a descent size dine in area."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"TL;DR: this place rocks!

Came here for dinner during a short visit into town. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really neat and well decorated. Service was top notch.

Now for the food. We started with a round of the garlic knots, which were superb. They were an impossibly perfect combination of fresh garlic, Parmesan, and expertly-crafted bread. For the entrée I got the Rigatoni Short Rib Ragu, which was recommended by our waiter. It was truly delicious - the sauce had an ever-so-slight spice to it that elevated the dish to the next level. The rigatoni was cooked to perfection and the short rib was flavorful and tender. Lastly, the cheese on top was left intentionally cold, serving as a way to alleviate some of the heat from the spice.

Overall, Noble Crust is a great place to eat and I would happily return!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Legitimately one of the best and most impressive live music venues in the area. I have attended a few shows there and this is hands down one of the best.

We ordered 10 wings, hot. I will now always order 10 wings, hot.  The wings were good sized and they are not breaded! Coated with plenty of sauce and more in the container to roll them around in. Yummy. 
Also, we got a large calzone. I must have forgotten just how large... a large is here. Larger than my head! Definitely had lunch for the next day.

Thank you for the awesome food Gia!"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Poor service. A third of the beers on the menu weren't in stock and the food took an hour and a half to make it to our tables. I ordered their ""signature"" Shclafly burger with an egg and the burger came out missing most of the toppings (onions lettuce and tomatoes) and also the patty fell completely apart while eating it. Also, we asked the hostess if our party would be able to split the bill before we sat down but the waitress's told us we wouldn't be able to do so and that ""all places are different."" Had the food been worth the wait I would of looked past the poor service but mind you we came in on a Sunday afternoon with barely anyone in the dining room/front garden. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will not return."
Restaurants,4.5,CG,"Man, these guys are the best! Started with the burger and fries, they are delish and the service was amazing. Tons of sit-down seating and they have a very large patio at the front of the restaurant. They have a full menu and you can pick your own appetizer. I went with the burger and it was absolutely amazing. The fries were cooked perfectly and the garlic mashed potatoes were cooked perfectly. The burger was cooked perfectly and the pickles were perfectly cooked. The portions were huge and I got a few side salads that were so good. I highly recommend the burgers and fries. I will be back for sure. You won't be disappointed. I can't wait to try their iced tea next time!

The only thing I'm not crazy about is the avocado toast. It's not that bad but I really prefer the avocado toast. It's got a little too much avocado. It's ok though, I just don't think it's worth the price. I've had so many of these things that I think this place is a must if you're looking for something.

Restaurants,4.0,OR,"Milk and Honey was a cute breakfast spot we visited while in town. They are only open til 3pm so make sure to get there early! You order at the counter and they bring you your plates. Our food came out quickly considering how busy they were and the size of our party. During the week they have half off mimosas which was a main draw for us. We ordered various plates with the menu being heavily based on biscuit based meals (which we were very happy about) and everything was great! Most dishes came with fruit or home fries. I got the Hot Mess, complete with pepper jelly and a bunch of other yummy stuff. The pepper jelly was a nice balance to the more savory components of the meal. Overall, it was a great little breakfast spot that I'd definitely visit again!"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"I was a little bit leery because of the average reviews, but I decided to take a stab -well literally- at their meal options here.

I settled for the third floor where sushi was an option. The host and hostess were friendly on the floor. The city view from the third floor was not bad either.  

I selected the princess's hot chicken and spicy tuna sushi  options. I was impressed by the quality for a diner.  This sushi could easily hold its own agains a sushi house like ""Sushi Train""  in upper midtown Mashville.

The Tuna was authentic and I like what they did with Princess's hot chicken. Perhaps I have a bias because I really think Princess hot chicken is the best hot chicken joint in the Nashville area. 


Try it, i hope you have a wonderful experience like I did."

I go to the food truck on the corner and get my order. The waitress asks if I want to sit down and I said yes. She sets the platter out and tells me to look at it. I look at it and then asked if there was any different food. She said that there was, so I picked something off the platter and ate it. Then I asked if I could have a little more of it as I was about to finish it. She said no. When I asked what it was, she said,"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"My fiancee went for dinner on a Friday night and the place was packed.  We were quickly seated and our waitress promptly came by to take our drink order.  She gave us some recommendations as to what was good and what we should avoid and she was spot-on.  We had a couple of specialty margaritas and the one made with beets and habanero was outstanding.

For food, we started with a bowl of tortilla soup which was tasty and a vegetarian chili which was very good.  For dinner, my fiancee had the brussels sprout taco which was good but could have used a little more flavoring.  I had the chick'n burrito with roasted root vegetables and it was delicious.

Overall we saw a lot of interesting items on the menu so we will be back to try out more of the menu."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"We arrived a little later on in the day, about 1 hr before the market closed. By then, they had sold out of the crab. That was a bummer, but if knowing how busy it can get, I should've came earlier to see if I got some of that famous crab. We did try the Chargrilled Oysters and they were delicious. The oysters we got were of a pretty good size, in comparison to other local restaurants that we had gotten them in previous days. The staff was super friendly and curteous. They do call you baby, lol, which is fine by us. The shrimp tacos were very delicious. We also got a shrimp po'boy and I wasn't a big fan of that sandwich. All in all, the food and service was great!! If you're in the french market, they are definitely worth a try."

The sushi is amazing and the prices are reasonable. The decor is modern, the service is fast and the food is delicious. The salads are also excellent. The pineapple sushi is my favorite. I get the sushi and the salad. The salad is very good. Just be warned it is very big and you will have to eat it all before you can finish it. I like that we can have a big salad on the table and not have to be rushed. My only complaint is that the portions are small. You should have more. I have tried the sampler, have never had a bad meal, ever. 

I love this place, they have good value, and they are a"
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"It took 25 minutes for my wine bottle to arrive and that was the best part of my service here. We sat with empty water and soda glasses for 90% of the time we sat there. We had to ask for bread three times and had to ask to get our waters refilled. The server ""apologized"" but no manager came over ever, even though our meal took almost two hours due to service problems (we are two adults and a child). Then I saw I was charged $4.50 for my baked potato, which I asked upon ordering if I could substitute it instead of rice with my steak and lobster. I have never been more ready to get out of a place, this dinner was our last one for our visit to St Louis and it is leaving us with a bad taste in our mouths."
Restaurants,4.5,OR,"I was lucky enough to be taken out to dinner here by a vendor, which is always the best way to dine!

The drinks at the bar were good, my co-workers enjoyed their Manhattans, and my pour of scotch was healthy.  

We shared a seafood platter, all of which tasted fairly fresh.  The seasoned shrimp was especially delicious.  The prime rib was a great cut of meat and cooked properly however I felt it couldve been seasoned a little more vigorously.   The sides of green beans and lobster mac and cheese were very tasty.

I didn't eat dessert but the slice of carrot cake served to my co-worker was HUGE, and it must've been good because he ate the whole thing.

The service was fantastic and the atmosphere very neat.  Overall a very good place to dine, however you do pay for it!"
Restaurants,4.5,CG,Entree was a great time. Food was good. Prices are on the expensive side but good. Staff was friendly. Address is Westlake Plaza in Tampa. Must have a reservation to get a table. Not sure if they have catering options. Would recommend. They have a great bar with complimentary cocktails. Lots of seating. Would be great with a group. Would not recommend if you are alone. Would recommend if you are with a lot of people. Will come back. Would not recommend if you are a group of people. Would recommend if you are alone. Would not recommend if you are a group of people.
Restaurants,3.0,CG,"I have been to Joe's a few times in the past. I was always happy with the food, but I just recently had to go back and try a new menu. I think the biggest thing I noticed was the prices. I think they should have a little more variety and higher prices. I'm not a big fan of the cheeseburger. I usually prefer to eat in and I just don't like the cheeseburger. I also have had the fried chicken nuggets and it was just average for the price. I thought the first few times I went that the burger was very good, but I wasn't always impressed. I think if you like a full meal and you're not a big fan of cheeseburgers, then it's probably"
Restaurants,3.5,OR,"The food here is great and the beer selection is absolutely great. The service was awesome. Unfortunately, this place has an issue with vloggers or anyone filming or taking photos. So much so that the staff told us to stop filming. A year ago I came to this bar with my company and brought 20+ people into this bar and filmed the event no problem. A year later I'm yelled at for visiting for a lunch with 3 of my friends - we were filming a conversation about battling cancer in a booth - not bothering anyone. The staff told us that no one could film inside without owners explicit permission. While I understand this as a business owner my self - I think the place needs to get with the times. We live in 2018-2019 where everyone's lives are filmed - just not at this bar."
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"People think it's a stuffy place - not at all and the food is fabulous!

I dined here years ago and loved it, but never went back.  Why, I'll never know!  This place is a secret gem.  The atmosphere is warm and quaint.  It's a limited menu, but everything is good so simply pick one and you'll be happy.  We had tuna, trout, scallops and shrimp at our table.  Each one was better than the other.  Even the basic salad was quite possibly the best I've ever had.  I ate it without looking up to see what anyone else got.  I think they ate their soup and salad just as happily as I did.

Don't be afraid.  Go try this place and get a window view if you can.  This time I'm not waiting years to go back!"
Restaurants,4.0,CG,"When I visit my sister, I always bring my customers to her. Always the best customer service and great food. The food is always delicious and the service always friendly. I highly recommend Happy Lemon. It's the best lemonade I've had in years. I'll never leave empty handed. Great food and great service. They are always happy to help you and I always feel welcome. Everyone at Happy Lemon is super friendly and helpful. I love my sister so much I don't want to leave her alone! Thank you for always being there for us. Thank you Happy Lemon!

Restaurants,4.5,CG,"This is still a regular stop for us, but it's a bit more pricey than I would've expected. For $70 for a small beer, and $45 for a medium beer, that's a bit much. The service was friendly and the food was good. I did go with a friend who wanted some chorizo, but they only had two on hand. The chorizo was really good, and I also ordered a cheese steak sandwich to go. If you're in the area, don't hesitate to try this place out. It's a nice little spot. If you're just stopping in for a few hours and want to try some new food, there's no better way to do that than this place."
Restaurants,3.0,OR,"This place just recently changed ownership and is now dynasty buffet, so I gave it another try.  I love it! It is now my favorite buffet. All the food was good, my absolute favorites being the creamy macaroni salad, the super tasty beef empanadas, the honey chicken, the crab rangoon which had a wonderful sweet cream cheese flavor, the tiny bite sized circular dessert thingies, and the cheesecake look alike cake (didnt have a label) that i topped with a bit of chocolate pudding. All this made for a delightfully sinful eat fest that I cant do often! If only I could double my metabolism! Lol. My least favorite items were the wonton soup and sushi, but they were still ok. The food and service here was much better than my last buffet disaster down the street.  I definitely recommend and dont bring the calorie counter:)"
Restaurants,4.0,OR,"This is a wonderful 3 meal restaurant that beckons you to return. And to return with your out-of-town guests.
You can sit outside or inside....either is very nice and relaxing.

While I've eaten there several times in the past, today I had the veggie Quiche of the Day: Full of cheeses, olives, onions, and peppers on a whole wheat crust. Very tasty and generous in size. It came with a delicious tomato-dill soup; a  fruit bowl of strawberries, grapes, and apples; and French bread. I did not leave hungry.

My partner got the apple salad which she pronounced ""magnificent."" Mixed together were glazed pecans, apples,, goat cheese, and vinaigrette salad dressing.

As we paid our bill in the gift shop, I spotted a lemon cookie and had to buy it.. Oh, boy, was that a good cookie!

I don't why we waited so long to return but we'll work on that angle."
